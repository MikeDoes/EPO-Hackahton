`The air conditioning and dust absorbing bionic wall has been inspired by the nasal turbinate of camel, suitable for hot and dry climates. This bio-inspired sustainable air conditioning wall is capable of controlling air flow through the interior spaces by humidifying the air, absorbing dust and decreasing the air temperature. The air conditioning and dust absorbing bionic wall is comprised of:
A turbinate, as the main part of the system, inspired by the respiratory system of camel: and also it is a place for thermoregulation and humidification;The external layer, the center of which the air inlet hole is placed in a diagonal direction with the angle of 45 degrees;The internal layer, the center of which the bottom of the turbinate is placed, and air outlet holes arc placed at the top and bottom of this layer;A nozzle with high pressure misting pump, located at the center of the internal layer. The nozzle is connected with flexible water hose to the high pressure misting pump;An electronic board, which is connected to the high pressure pump to control the pump activity rate;And in order to bring out the contaminated water, a waste water outlet is located at the center of the internal layer and at the bottom of the place which the turbinate is located in.[Claim 2]The air conditioning and dust absorbing bionic wall according to claim 1. is inspired by the nasal turbinate of camel. Generally, Camels, due to their brain cooling ability, can cope with the harsh condition of hot and dry climates. The cooling strategy starts during the inhalation, when the hot and dry air of desert enters from outside to the inside of the nasal turbinate. The nasal turbinate has a spiral and laminar structure with narrow air passageways and a large surface area. This scrolled structure rotates the respiratory air. clockwise and counter clockwise; and meanwhile, the mucus in the mucous membrane evaporates and the air is saturated with vapor. These mechanism works as a cooler and humidifier; and moreover, as an efficient filter which most of the dust particles are stopped in. Therefore, the three factors including: air cooling, air humidifying and dust absorbing arc derived from the function of the nasal turbinate of camels.[Claim 3]The air conditioning and dust absorbing bionic wall according to claim 1. is a sustainable apparatus. This system provides thermal comfort of buildings by natural ventilating and very low consumption of energy. In addition, the turbinate is made by the PLA as a renewable material in 3D printing; and the internal and external layers arc made by the environmentally friendly and light weighted materials.
