        <summary>Introduction</summary>

        <p>As part of PatentVariable's submission for the EPO's Codefest on Green Plastics Hackathon, we developed an
            interactive demonstration for our Universal Patent Classifier powered by artificial intelligence and knowledge graphs. 
            This interactive demo allows users to quickly and accurately match patents to their respective CPCs. To enhance the quality of the application in a
            qualitative manner, we also provide three potential reasons for why a patent is classified in a given CPC.
        </p>
        <p>From a technical standpoint, we achieved this performance through fine-tuning a state-of-the-art GPT-3 model
            with claims extracted from the EPO's Open Data Services API. This interactive dashboard is available free of
            charge through the credentials provided in the presentation. If you have any issues with the credentials,
            please e-mail mike@ipft.co</p>
