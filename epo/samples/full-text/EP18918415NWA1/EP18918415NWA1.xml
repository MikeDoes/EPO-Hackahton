<heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The subject matter herein generally relates to the field of cables, and more particularly, to a wide-angle radiating leaky cable.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">This section is intended to provide background or context for the embodiments of the present disclosure set forth in the claims. Descriptions related herein are not admitted to be prior art by being included in this section.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Leaky cables have both a signal transmission function and an antenna radiation function. The leaky cable can wirelessly communicate with external space through slots defined at the outer conductive body. The leaky cable has the advantages of uniform signal coverage and easy installation. Thus, the leaky cable is widely used in wireless communication systems installed in narrow spaces such as tunnels, mines, subways, adits, and also high-speed trains and indoor buildings, and has a very broad development prospect. When covered by wireless network, because the indoor environment is complicated, a larger radial radiation angle of the leaky cable is needed to eliminate the signal dead zones to obtain a uniform signal coverage.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">With the development and frequently use of communication technology, to meet the requirement of high-frequency signals, the slot size of the leaky cable becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> smaller. Therefore, the radial radiation range of the leaky cable at high frequency also becomes smaller, thus the leaky cable cannot meet the requirement of indoor wide-angle coverage by eliminating the signal dead zones. At the same time, when the frequency band becomes wider, the existing slot becomes incompatible with low-frequency coupling and high-frequency attenuation. Thus, the cost of indoor signal coverage is increased.</p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">What is needed, is a wide-angle radiating leaky cable which has a wide radial radiation angle of 170 degrees or more, small coupling loss, good compatibility with high frequency and low frequency, large radial signal coverage, and high uniformity.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a wide-angle radiating leaky cable, from inner side to outer side, including an inner conductive body, an insulating layer, an outer conductive body, and an outer protective casing.

<p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, a radial radiation angle of each slot module is between 170 degrees and 360 degrees.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, the slot units of each slot module are spaced apart from and do not communicate with each other, a distance between two adjacent end portions of two adjacent slot units on a unfolded wall of the outer conductor is between 0.5 mm to 50 mm.</p>
