<heading id="h0003">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a device that quantitatively and stably feeds powder having a fine particle size such as metal, ceramic, or plastic has been widely used, for example, in a thermal spraying device, a spacer spraying device for a liquid crystal substrate, a powder compression molding, a sandblast device, a powder coating device, and the like, (for example, refer to Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Document 1 discloses a gas transfer type quantitative feeder for powder that can quantitatively feed a desired amount of powder in accordance with the properties of the powder by using a surface location detecting means for detecting the surface location of the powder, a level adjustment mechanism for adjusting an outlet of a feed nozzle to an appropriate position adjacent to the powder surface, and a controlling means to maintain the outlet of the feed nozzle to an appropriate position, which makes it possible to always determine the optimal device position for the outlet placed at the tip of the feed nozzle and the surface of the powder in the cassette container.

<heading id="h0005"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Quantitative and stable introduction of powder from a powder storage container into a powder transfer passage has been achieved by the inventions according to Patent Documents 1 and 2. However, such a device makes the powder electrostatically charged due to friction with the inner wall of the transfer passage during gas transfer, and particularly in the case of fine powder particles with extremely light mass, the fine powder particles adhere to the tube inner wall by failing to counter against electrostatic attractive force with the tube inner wall which is oppositely charged. Then, the layer of adhered fine powder grows as the operation time of the device is elongated, which ultimately blocks the transfer passage, possibly leading to feed suspension of the powder.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to avoid such a problem, there has been conventionally used a means in which a metal or a conductive plastic that facilitates charge transfer is used as a constituting material of a transfer passage to release the static electricity into the ground. However, when such a conductive material is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> used, there arises a new problem that the transfer passage must be replaced frequently because the transferred powder comes into contact with the transfer passage made of the conductive material to abrade the inner wall of the transfer passage. Further, there is also known a method of electrical neutralization by blowing oppositely charged ions to the generated electrical charges; however, the effect is low because even if ions having opposite charges are fed from an inlet of a long and thin passage such as the powder transfer passage, the charge of ions disappear on the way and do not spread over the entire transfer passage because the lives of the ions are short.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, in the field of handling powder, basically the inclusion of water in the powder is avoided as much as possible, and particularly in the field of gas transfer type powder quantitative feeding, it is common to dry not only the powder but also the carrier gas. This is because a high water content causes liquid cross-linking between the particles that are the cause of inducing adhesion in between the particles which impairs the fluidity of the powder. However, although in the case of a powder kind that is dependent of powder fluidity, i.e. powder with good fluidity, reducing the liquid cross-linking by eliminating the water content contributes to its quantitative/stable feeding, in the case of powder such as fine powder with low fluidity, there is a need of a solution for the problem induced by static electricity because an adverse effect is rather large due to static electricity generated in a dry state.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, in order to quantitatively transfer and feed the fine powder by the carrier gas, there is a demand for a method for removing static electricity which is a cause of powder adhesion to the transfer passage and a system used for such a method.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problem, and an object of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> invention is to provide a gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding method and system capable of quantitatively and stably transferring and feeding powder, in particular, fine powder having an extremely light mass. The present invention is also to provide a carrier gas humidifying unit that can be used in such method and system.</p>

<heading id="h0007">[Mode for Carrying out the Invention]</heading>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Hereinafter, modes for carrying out the present invention (hereinafter referred to as embodiments) will be described in details with reference to the drawings. Note that, the present invention shall not be limited to the embodiments described below. In addition, constituting elements in the embodiments described below include those that can be easily predicted by those skilled in the art and those that are substantially the same. Further, the constituting elements disclosed in the embodiments below can be appropriately combined.</p>
<heading id="h0008">&lt; Gas Transfer Type Fine Powder Quantitative Feeding Method &gt;</heading>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding method of the present invention shall be explained. <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram of a gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding method according to the present invention. The gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding method of the present invention is characterized in that humidity of the carrier gas is adjusted such that static electricity in the mixed fluid of the fine powder and the carrier gas generated at the time of transferring the fine powder is reduced. As shown in Flow 1 in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the humidity of the carrier gas can be adjusted by, for example, mixing a high-humidity gas when the dry gas is fed from the gas feed source to the fine powder feeder. As shown in Flow 2 of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a carrier gas with its humidity adjusted beforehand may be prepared, and the humidity-adjusted carrier gas may be fed to the fine powder feeder as it is.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The method for adjusting humidity (humidification) of the carrier gas can be carried out by any method as long as the present invention can exert its effect. For example, the humidity of the carrier gas can be adjusted to be in a desired range by mixing a dry gas and a high-humidity gas containing liquid atomized by atomization and appropriately adjusting the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> mixture ratio. The atomization method of the liquid is commonly done by way of ultrasonic wave. Therefore, the gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding method of the present invention may include a step of mixing the dry gas and the high-humidity gas to adjust the humidity before feeding the carrier gas to the fine powder quantitative feeder, or the carrier gas whose humidity has been adjusted in advance may be supplied to the fine powder quantitative feeder as it is.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In the present invention, fine powder refers to fine powder having an average particle size of 10 µm or less, and the smaller the average particle size is, the fine powder is more likely to be affected by static electricity. Examples of the fine powder include, but are not particularly limited to, metal, plastic, and ceramic. In addition, since plastic and ceramic which are light in mass are more easily charged than metal and more likely to be affected by static electricity, there is a high demand for removal of static electricity. In the present invention, the average particle size of the fine powder can be calculated by geometric particle size measurement using an image measurement method when, for example, in the case of powder used in general thermal spraying.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Accordingly, in the case of a fine powder having an extremely small particle size and an extremely light mass, it is impossible to prevent the adsorption between the fine powders to each other or between the fine powder and other substances by reducing liquid cross-linking force or capillary force by removal of water as carried out in the conventional powder feed field. Fluidity of the powder, contributing to the easiness of the powder being transferred, has higher dependency on surface properties as the particle size gets smaller, and due to the friction generated between the powder and the transfer tube at the time of transfer, particularly in the case of inside a tube like a transfer tube, the absorption of the fine powder is more dominated by the static electricity force than by liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> cross-linking by water. Further, the means where metal or conductive plastic in which charge transfer is easy is used as the material for constituting the transferring path to release static energy to the ground has a new problem that friction of the transferring path is generated. Further, neutralization by oppositely charged ions is less effective in the powder transferring path having a very long and narrow form because the ions do not sufficiently spread inside the tube.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Here, static electricity is a physical phenomenon caused by electric charges which are static, and it is considered that the static electricity is generated when fine powder moving at a speed equal to or higher than a certain level comes into contact with the inner wall of the transferring tube during gas transfer of the fine powder in the case of feeding the fine powder. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, when static electricity is generated in the mixed fluid during transfer of the fine powder, fine powder a having an extremely light mass is drawn and attached to transferring tube 1, and is deposited on the inner wall of the tube 1. Then the deposited fine powder a' further deposits by drawing fine powder a that is transferred afterwards, and eventually the transferring tube 1 gets blocked, making it impossible to feed the fine powder a. Therefore, suppressing static electricity in the mixed fluid of the fine powder a and the transferring gas is important in quantitative and stable feeding of the fine powder.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">On the other hand, when the humidity of the carrier gas is too high or when the fine powder itself is humidified, the fine powder could adhere to the inside of the transferring path due to dew condensation, making it impossible being fed, or its melting could be incomplete in the subsequent thermal spraying.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Taking into consideration such a situation, the present inventors have found that the problem caused by static<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> electricity generated in the process of transferring and feeding can be solved by adjusting the humidity of the carrier gas, which conventionally was dried in general, within a predetermined humidity range.</p>
<heading id="h0009">&lt; Scattering Time τ &gt;</heading>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">As an indicator of the magnitude of the influence of static electricity on powder transfer, evaluation can be carried out by using scattering time τ. τ is a parameter indicating the time from generation to elimination (scattering) of the static electricity. For example, as is clear from a graph (<figref idref="f0005">FIG. 8</figref>) showing the relationship between τ and the absolute humidity in a test example described below, it is known that the higher the absolute humidity is, the static electricity is less likely to be charged, and thus τ becomes smaller, and that there is an extremely high correlation between the fact that static electricity is uneasily accumulated and humidity. It is also known that the lower the temperature is, the smaller τ becomes in the same absolute humidity. Therefore, it can be said that the time until the static electricity eliminates can be shortened by lowering the temperature while maintaining the absolute humidity high. In the present invention, the scattering time τ refers to a value measured by the following method. That is, a certain amount of charged fine powder (e.g. alumina powder) is stored in a faraday cup and placed in a humidifying chamber kept in a predetermined humidity. Then, immediately after placing the faraday cup storing the fine powder in the humidifying chamber, charged amount of the fine powder is measured by using a measuring instrument such as an electrostatic capacity meter to record a charged amount change curve, and the time until the charged amount of the fine powder decreases to 37.8% of the initial value at t = 0 is read, and such time is defined as τ.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">There is a correlation that is uniquely determined between the absolute humidity and τ, and if a numerical value<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of either one can be found out, it is possible to determine the other one in the case of static electricity generated in a specific substance. Specifically, the following relation is satisfied in between scattering time τ (second), electric resistance R (Ω) of a substance in which static electricity is generated, and static capacity C (F). <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">τ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="23" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Here, C is a value that can be measured by a static capacity meter such as an LCR meter, and since it is known that the electric resistance R has an exponential relationship with the absolute humidity, if either one of the absolute humidity and the scattering time τ can be found out, it is possible to calculate the other one.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In the present invention, scattering time τ is 0 to 10 seconds, preferably 0 to 8 seconds, more preferably 0 to 5 seconds. When τ is in such a range, the influence of static electricity generated in the tube on powder blockage is small, and the fine powder can be transferred and fed quantitatively and stably.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Determining such a correlation between τ and humidity in advance makes it possible to maintain the scattering time τ within a predetermined range by adjusting the humidity in the present invention.</p>

<p id="p0035" num="0035">The method for gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding according to the present invention can be carried out by using any fine powder quantitative feeder as long as the effect of the present invention can be exerted. In order to quantitatively and stably transfer and feed fine powder having an average particle size of 10 µm or less as in the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> present invention, it is preferable to use, without particular limitation, a so-called surface-profiling type powder quantitative feeder as disclosed in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH08309177A"><text>JP H08-309177 A</text></patcit>, among conventional powder transfer devices.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a figure showing one embodiment of a gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeder that can be used in the method for gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeding according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the gas transfer type fine powder quantitative feeder 10 includes a fine powder storage container 11, a housing 12, a feed port 13, a first flow rate adjustment mechanism 14, a feed nozzle 15, a position detection sensor 16, a position control mechanism 17, and a humidity measuring sensor 19.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The housing 12 includes the fine powder storage container 11 inside. The housing 12 is formed into, for example, a cylindrical shape. The housing 12 has a gas-tight structure and comprises a casing space b inside between the fine powder storage container 11. In addition, a humidity sensor 19 for monitoring the humidity of the casing space b may be provided, and the amount of the humidified carrier gas supplied from the feed port 13 to the housing 12 through the carrier gas feed path L1 may be adjusted by the first flow rate adjustment mechanism 14 in conjunction with the humidity sensor 19. By adjusting the feed amount of the humidified carrier gas in conjunction with the humidity sensor, it is possible to maintain the humidity inside the casing space b within the prescribed range. Further, an exhaust valve (not illustrated) may be provided so that the gas is exhausted when the pressure becomes equal to or higher than a predetermined pressure, in case when the pressure of the casing space b becomes excessively high.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The fine powder storage container 11 stores the fine powder a. The fine powder a may be filled in the fine powder<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> storage container 11 before the start of the operation of the device, or may be filled by a feed nozzle (not illustrated) or the like, for example, while the device is being operated. The fine powder a is preferably filled in the fine powder storage container 11 beforehand so that the fine powder 11 can be fed outside from the start of operation of the device. The fine powder a stored in the fine powder storage container 11 is taken in with the carrier gas by the feed nozzle 15, passes through the fine powder feed path L2 as a mixed fluid c of the fine powder a and the carrier gas, and is supplied to the fine powder using device such as a thermal spraying device 20. Accordingly, the fine powder a can be prevented from blocking by the static electricity in the fine powder feed path L2 by adjusting the humidity of the carrier gas within the predetermined range when the fine powder a is supplied to the fine powder using device by a carrier gas.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The feed nozzle 15 discharges the fine powder a in the fine powder storage container 11 entrained by the humidity-adjusted carrier gas fed from the feed port 13. The carrier gas fed into the fine powder storage container 11 flows into the feed nozzle 15 while taking in the fine powder a in the fine powder storage container 11. The mixed fluid c flowing out from the feed nozzle 15 passes through the fine powder feed path L2 and is supplied to the fine powder using device such as the thermal spraying device 20.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">It is preferable that the feed speed of the mixed fluid c supplied from the fine powder feeder 10 to the thermal spray device 20 is appropriately adjusted according to the purpose of use and the characteristics, for example, the specific gravity and the bulk density of the fine powder.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">When the fine powder a in the fine powder storage container 11 is entrained by the carrier gas, it is preferable that the outlet 15A provided at the tip of the feed nozzle 15 is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> disposed in the vicinity of the surface of the fine powder a, and allowing it to be in contact with the surface of the fine powder a or allowing it to shallowly invade as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>. Accordingly, suction action of the carrier gas flowing through the feed nozzle 15 makes the fine powder a at the vicinity of the tip of the feed nozzle 15 simultaneously taken in to be entrained by and exhausted with the carrier gas. Note that, the invasion speed of the fine powder a into the outlet 15A of the tip of the feed nozzle 15 depends on the rotation speed of the fine powder storage container 11.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The feed nozzle 15 is inserted inside of the housing 12 from lid 18. The feed nozzle 15 is configured to be movable in the up and down direction in the housing 12 by the position control mechanism 17.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">The position control mechanism 17 is provided on a lid 18 at an upper portion of the housing 12, and can move the feed nozzle 15 in the up and down direction. As for the position control mechanism 17, it is possible to use an electrical cylinder without particular limitation.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">The position control mechanism 17 includes a cylinder body 30 that moves the feed nozzle 15 up and down, a rod 31 that is movable in the up and down direction in the cylinder body 30, a gripping portion 32 that is coupled to the rod 31 and grips the feed nozzle 15, and a drive mechanism 33. The position control mechanism 17 can adjust the height of the feed nozzle 15 held by the gripping portion 32 by adjusting the height of the rod 31. The feed nozzle 15 moves the gripping portion of the cylinder body 30 via the rod 31 in the up and down direction to adjust the position of the tip of the feed nozzle 15. This makes it possible to adjust the outlet 15A positioned at the tip of the feed nozzle 15 to an appropriate position at the vicinity of the fine powder a surface. For example, when the fine powder a in the fine powder storage container 11<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> is to be fed to the fine powder feed path L2, the position control mechanism 17 makes the tip of the feed nozzle 15 to fall towards the surface of the fine powder a. On the other hand, when stopping the feeding of the fine powder a in the fine powder storage container 11 to the fine powder feed path L2, the feed nozzle 15 is elevated so that the tip of the feed nozzle 15 does not come into contact with the fine powder a.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">The motor 25 rotates the fine powder storage container 11 in a horizontal direction with respect to the axial direction. The fine powder storage container 11 is placed on a rotating seat 41 having a rotation axis 40 at the center of the bottom of the fine powder storage container 11, and by driving the motor 25, the rotation axis rotates, which makes the fine powder storage container 11 rotates. The motor 25 can rotate the rotation axis 40 at a speed corresponding to the feed amount of the mixed fluid c. By rotating the fine powder storage container 11, the fine powder a can be stably taken in by preventing the fine powder a from running out in the vicinity of the tip of the feed nozzle 15.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">The position detection sensor 16 is fixed to the fine powder feed nozzle 15 while maintaining a predetermined height from the tip of the fine powder feed nozzle 15 and measures the distance to the surface of the fine powder a using the position of the tip of the fine powder feed nozzle 15 as the measuring standard. The position detection sensor 16 detects the surface position of the fine powder in front of the outlet 15A at the tip of the fine powder storage container 11 on the trajectory of the relative motion drawn with respect to the rotation of the fine powder storage container 11. Accordingly, it is possible to measure the height of the surface position of the fine powder a suctioned from the outlet 15A and the outlet 15A beforehand. The height of the feed nozzle 15 can be appropriately adjusted from the measurement result of the position detection sensor 16.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, a scraper 60, a flap 61, a brush 62, and the like may be fixed to and suspended from the gripping portion 32. By making the scraper 60, the flap 61, and the brush 62 fix to and suspend from the gripping portion 32, the surface of the fine powder a in the fine particle storage container 11 is evened, thereby making the surface smooth. This makes it possible to stabilize the amount of the fine powder a taken in from the feed nozzle 15 because the difference in the surface height of the fine powder a can be reduced. In addition, since the surface becomes smooth, the difference in the surface height of the fine powder a can be measured more accurately. It is not necessary to provide all of the scraper 60, the flap 61, and the brush 62 in the gripping portion 32, and one or more of these may be provided.</p>
