<p id="p0028" num="0028">It should be noted that the embodiments in the present disclosure and the features in the present disclosure may be combined with each other if there is no conflict.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Hereinafter, the technical solution of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings and in combination with the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of a lane selection method for an automatic-driving vehicle according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a lane selection method for an automatic-driving vehicle according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the following steps S1 to S4.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In step S1, a road environment model for a preset range around a vehicle is provided, and the road environment model includes a lane classification, a quantity and obstacle information of lanes in the preset range around the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Specifically, the vehicle is provided with an environment sensing system, which replaces a sensory system of a driver to extract current driving environment information, such as a road, a vehicle location, the lane classification, the quantity of lanes and the obstacle information of each lane, through different sensors. The above information is screened, associated, tracked, filtered, or the like, so as to obtain more accurate road information, object location, size and other information, which are used to finally generate the road environment model. The road environment model outputs the lane classification, the quantity of lanes and the obstacle information of each lane in the preset range (for example, 200m) in front of and behind the vehicle in real time.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In step S2, the lane classification is acquired according to the road environment model. In this embodiment, the lane classification includes a normal lane, an acceleration lane, and a deceleration lane. The normal lane is a lane between a position where the vehicle leaves the acceleration lane to enter an expressway main road and a position where the vehicle leaves the expressway main road to enter the deceleration lane, and the normal lane does not include special roads, such as a narrowed road, a widened road or a crotched road.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of an acceleration lane, a normal lane and a deceleration lane according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the quantity of normal lanes is three.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In step S3, the quantity of the lanes corresponding to a driving direction of the vehicle and the obstacle information of all the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle are acquired according to the road environment model, if the vehicle is driving in a normal lane.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In step S4, in a case that the quantity of the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle is greater than or equal to three, stationary obstacle determination (the stationary obstacle may be a prompting sign erected due to road construction, a vehicle unable to move due to traffic accident, a solid obstacle failing in the lane, or the like.) is performed on the lanes in a priority sequence from left to right starting from a second left lane of the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle, and a lane without any stationary obstacle is selected as a target lane. That is, except a leftmost lane, the lane without any stationary obstacle is selected as the target lane based on the principle of driving on the left side, so that the vehicle can maintain a relatively high speed in the automatic driving.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, after step S3, the method further includes that, in a case that the quantity of the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle is two, a right lane is selected as the target lane if no stationary obstacle is in the right lane; a left lane is selected as the target lane if a stationary obstacle is in the right lane and no stationary obstacle is in the left lane. That is, when the vehicle is automatically driving in the normal lane, in the case that there are totally two lanes in the driving direction of the vehicle, the right lane is first considered. That is, if no obstacle is in the right lane, the right lane is selected as the target lane, and if an obstacle is in the right lane and no obstacle is in the left lane, the left lane is selected as the target lane.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, after step S2, the method further includes that, the obstacle information of all normal lanes connected to an acceleration lane is acquired according to the road environment model if the vehicle is driving in the acceleration lane, and a lane without any stationary obstacle is selected, in a priority sequence from right to left among normal lanes connected to the acceleration lane, as a target lane to be used after leaving the acceleration lane. That is, when the vehicle is about to enter the normal lane from the acceleration lane, a rightmost lane of the normal lanes connected to the acceleration lane is first considered. If no stationary obstacle is in the rightmost lane, the rightmost lane is selected as the target lane to be used after leaving the acceleration lane. If a stationary<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> obstacle is in the rightmost lane, the lane (in the preset range) without any obstacle is selected, in a priority sequence from right to left, as the target lane to be used after leaving the acceleration lane.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, after step S2, the method further includes that, the quantity of lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle between the a normal lane and a deceleration lane, and the obstacle information of all the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle between the normal lane and the deceleration lane are acquired according to the road environment model, if the vehicle is driving in the normal lane and is about to enter the deceleration lane. Then a lane without any stationary obstacle is selected as a target lane to be used before entering the deceleration lane, according to the quantity of the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle between the normal lane and the deceleration lane and in a priority sequence from right to left among all the lanes corresponding to the driving direction of the vehicle between the normal lane and the deceleration lane. That is to say, when the vehicle is driving on the normal lane and is close to an entrance of the deceleration lane, a rightmost lane is first considered. If no stationary obstacle is in the rightmost lane, the rightmost lane is selected as the target lane to be used before entering the deceleration lane. If an obstacle is in the rightmost lane, the lane (in the preset range) without any stationary obstacle is selected in a priority sequence from right to left as the target lane to be used before entering the deceleration lane.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a vehicle about to enter the deceleration lane according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a condition for determining that the vehicle is about to enter the deceleration lane is that a signal indicating to enter the deceleration lane is received from an automatic-driving system, and a distance between the vehicle and the entrance of the deceleration lane is less than a preset prompting distance.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the lane selection method for the automatic-driving vehicle according to the present disclosure, the target lane is selected according to the lane where the vehicle is located, the quantity of lanes and the obstacle in the lanes, to control the automatic-driving vehicle to drive in the target lane, so that the vehicle can drive at a relatively high speed while ensuring normal driving.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>

As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the lane selection system for the automatic-driving vehicle according to the embodiment of the present disclosure includes a road environment information providing model 410 and a control module 420.</p>
