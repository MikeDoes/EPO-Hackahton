<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h0003"><u>Technical Field</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention is directed generally to the production of knock-in non-human mammals and cells and chimeric immunoglobulin chains and antibodies.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><u>Description of the Related Art</u></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Disease therapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized medicine, and mAb-based drugs are now utilized in the treatment of cancer, autoimmunity, inflammation, macular degeneration, infections, etc. However, the available technologies for generation and discovery of mAbs for use in the prevention and treatment of diseases and disorders have significant drawbacks including inefficiency, absence or loss of sufficient potency, absence or loss of specificity and the induction of an immune response against the therapeutic mAb. The first attempts to use mAbs as therapeutics were hindered by the immunogenicity of the mouse amino acid composition of the mAbs. When administered to humans, the mouse amino acid sequence elicited a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response that dramatically reduced the potency and pharmacokinetics of the drug as well as causing severe and potentially fatal allergic reactions.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Additional methods to generate mAb therapeutics include chimerized mAbs (cmAbs) created through recombinant DNA technology combining a mouse-derived variable domain appended to a human constant region. Other methods of generating antibodies involve humanizing mAbs <i>in vitro</i> to further reduce the amount of mouse amino acid sequence in a therapeutic mAb. Antibody-display technologies developed to generate "fully-human" antibodies <i>in vitro</i> have yet to adequately mimic the natural antibody maturation process that occurs during an in vivo immune response (see <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>pg. 1122-23, Lonberg, Nat. Biotech. (2005) 23:1117-1125</text></nplcit>.) mAbs developed using these methods can elicit an immune response that can reduce efficacy and/or be life-threatening, and they are typically a time-consuming and costly process. Also, during the molecular processes inherent in these methods, loss of affinity and epitope shifting can occur, thereby reducing potency and introducing undesirable changes in specificity.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Transgenic mice have been engineered to produce fully human antibodies by introducing human antibody transgenes to functionally replace inactivated mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) loci. However, many of these transgenic mouse models lack important components in the antibody development process, such as sufficient diversity in the genes from which antibody variable regions are generated, the ability to make IgD (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Loset et al., J. Immunol., (2004) 172:2925-2934</text></nplcit>), important cis regulatory elements important for class switch recombination (CSR), or a fully functional 3' locus control region (LCR) (e.g., <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US7049426B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,049,426</text></patcit>; and<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text> Pan et al., Eur. J. Immunol. (2000) 30:1019-1029</text></nplcit>). Some transgenic mice contain yeast artificial chromosomes or human miniloci as integrated transgenes. Others carry transchromosomes that exhibit various frequencies of mitotic and meiotic instability. Furthermore, the fully human constant regions of these transgenic mice function sub-optimally due to reduced activity in conjunction with other endogenous and trans-acting components of the BCR signal transduction apparatus, <i>e.g</i>., Igα and Igβ, and Fc receptors (FcR), as compared to normal mice.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Mice have also been genetically engineered to produce chimeric antibodies that are composed of human V domains appended to mouse C domains that remain fully intact, with the fully-intact and modified portions including all genomic DNA downstream of the J gene cluster (see <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5770429A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,770,429</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6596541B"><text>6,596,541</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20070061900"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0061900</text></patcit>). Human V regions from these mice can be recovered and appended to human constant region genes by molecular biological methods and expressed by recombinant methods to produce fully-human antibodies. The antibodies from these mice may exhibit reduction or loss of activity, potency, solubility etc. when the human V region is removed from the context of the mouse C domains with which it was evolved and then appended to a human C region to make a fully human antibody.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Current methods of developing a therapeutic mAb can alter functions of the antibody, such as solubility, potency and antigen specificity, which were selected for during initial stages development. In addition, mAbs generated by current methods have the potential to elicit a dangerous immune response upon administration. Current human and chimeric antibody producing mice lack appropriate genetic content to function properly, e.g., genetic diversity, cis regulatory elements, <i>trans</i> acting regulatory elements, signaling domains, genetic stability. It would be beneficial to develop methods and compositions for the enhanced generation and discovery of therapeutic antibodies and that retain potency and specificity through the antibody generation, discovery, development, and production process without eliciting an immune response, as well as methods of producing such antibodies. The present invention provides a solution for generating such antibodies in transgenic animals.</p>

<heading id="h0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h0008"><u>Overview</u></heading>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The present invention includes knock-in non-human mammals that produce chimeric or humanized antibodies, methods of producing such knock-in non-human cells and mammals, and compositions and kits comprising the antibodies produced thereby.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Specifically, embodiments of the invention provide chimericantibody producing non-human mammals and cells and methods of producing the mammals and cells. In antibody producing mammals, the endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig) V, (D) and J genes are replaced by their human orthologs using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells by methods described herein, such as using BACs carrying large portions of the human V, D and J genes and flanked by appropriate homology targeting DNA so as to facilitate high-frequency homologous recombination into the endogenous IgH locus. This can be done in a single replacement in each Ig locus, by sequential ("walking") replacement, or by replacing portions of the locus followed by removing intervening sequences. A BAC carrying all or part of the IgH locus downstream of JH can be engineered so that in each constant region gene, the endogenous CH1 domain is replaced with a human CH1 domain using the ability to make very precise modifications of DNA carried in BACs in E. <i>coli.</i> Alternatively, a BAC carrying all or part of the IgH locus downstream of JH can be engineered so that in each constant region gene, the endogenous CH1<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> domain is replaced with a human CH1 domain, using the ability to precisely synthesize and assemble DNAs based on published genome sequences of humans and other organisms such as the mouse. Such synthesis and assembly is known in the art and is practiced by commercial entities (e.g., DNA2.0, Menlo Park, CA; Blue Heron Biotechnology, Bothell, WA).</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">A benefit of the overall strategy to replace the endogenous Ig loci with components of the human Ig loci so as to produce human V domains optimized in vivo during primary and secondary immune responses is that the total number of loci altered is reduced compared to available strategies. The strategy of the present invention employs 2 or 3 altered loci, greatly simplifying the breeding process, and thereby providing an opportunity to introduce other useful mutations into the genetic background. Such useful mutations may include those that help break immune tolerance so as to more efficiently generate antibodies against human antigens that are very highly conserved between species. These include transgenic over-expression of CD19, knockout of the inhibitory receptor FcyRllb, Ipr or other autoimmune prone mutations, knockouts of the gene for the antigen, or zinc-finger transgenes engineered to silence expression of specific genes such as the antigen.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Another benefit of the overall strategy to replace the endogenous Ig loci with components of the human Ig loci is that it obviates <i>trans</i> recombination and <i>trans</i> switching that occurs between human Ig transgenes inserted in a chromosomal location outside the endogenous loci. The Ig chain product resulting from such <i>trans</i> recombination and <i>trans</i> switching events are chimeric for human-endogenous Ig sequences but deviate from the product design engineered in the transgene.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Yet another alternative is to incorporate fully human Ig loci including the human C regions, in place of the complete endogenous Ig loci and also replace the cluster of endogenous FcR genes with the orthologous cluster of human FcR genes using a similar BAC-based genetic engineering in homologous recombinantion competent cells, such as ES cells. In this way fully human antibodies can be produced, and during an immune response, these<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> human antibodies can engage the human FcR normally. Such animals would also have the benefit of being useful for testing for the activity of effector function of human therapeutic mAb candidates in animal models of disease when bred onto the appropriate genetic background for the model, i.e., SCID, nu/nu, nod, and Ipr mice. Further, the human target gene sequence can replace the endogenous gene using BAC targeting technology in homologous recombination-competent cells, such as ES cells, providing models for target validation and functional testing of the antibody.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Another embodiment incorporates fully human Ig including the human C regions comprising CH1-hinge-CH2-CH3(-CH4) and the cognate syngeneic, e.g., mouse, membrane and intracellular domains so as to provide native intracellular signal transduction and to enable association of the IgH in the B-cell receptor with Igα and Igβ and therein allow murine-type signaling from the Igα, Igβ and IgG containing B-cell receptor. In yet another embodiment, the membrane and intracellular domain of the heavy chain constant region are from the same or non-cognate mouse heavy chain isotypes. Such engineering of the constant region genes can be readily accomplished using methods of the invention as detailed below.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Engineering the chimeric antibodies in this manner prevents the alteration in the V domain conformation resulting from the in vitro switch from a first C region, particularly a CH1 domain, and optionally a portion of the hinge region, from one species, e.g., mouse, with which it was evolved during the in vivo immune response to a second C region, particularly a CH1 domain, and optionally a portion of the hinge region, from another species, e.g., human. The antibodies produced by the knock-in animals of the present invention do not exhibit the reduction or loss of activity and potency seen in antibodies from other chimeric antibody producing animals when the human V region is appended to a human C region to make a fully human antibody, which may be caused by altered conformation of the VH domain resulting from the changing of the CH1 domain and/or by differences in antigen binding because of changed length or flexibility of the upper hinge regions (the peptide sequence<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> from the end of the CH1 to the first cysteine residue in the hinge that forms an inter-heavy chain disulfide bond, and which are variable in length and composition) when switching from mouse to human constant region (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Roux et al., J. Immunology (1997) 159:3372-3382</text></nplcit> and references therein). The middle hinge region is bounded by the cysteine residues that form inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds.</p>
<heading id="h0009"><u>Definitions</u></heading>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Before describing certain embodiments in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions or biological systems, which can vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular illustrative embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. The terms used in this specification generally have their ordinary meaning in the art, within the context of this invention and in the specific context where each term is used. Certain terms are discussed below or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner in describing the compositions and methods of the invention and how to make and use them. The scope and meaning of any use of a term will be apparent from the specific context in which the term is used. As such, the definitions set forth herein are intended to provide illustrative guidance in ascertaining particular embodiments of the invention, without limitation to particular compositions or biological systems. As used in the present disclosure and claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">As used herein, "antibody" or "immunoglobulin" (Ig) refer to protein molecules produced by B cells that recognize and bind specific antigens and that may either be membrane bound or secreted. Antibodies may be monoclonal, in that they are produced by a single clone of B cells and therefore recognize the same epitope and have the same nucleic acid and amino acid sequence, or polyclonal, in that they are produced by multiple clones of B cells,<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> recognize one or more epitopes of the same antigen and typically have different nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Antibody, or Ig, molecules are typically comprised of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains linked together through disulfide bonds. Both heavy chains (IgH) and light chains (IgL) contain a variable (V) region or domain and a constant (C) region or domain. The portion of the IgH locus encoding the V region comprises multiple copies of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments. The portion of the IgL loci, Igκ and Igλ, encoding the V region comprises multiple copies of V and J gene segments. The V region encoding portion of the IgH and IgL loci undergo gene rearrangement, e.g., different combinations of gene segments arrange to form the IgH and IgL variable regions, to develop diverse antigen specificity in antibodies. The secreted form of the IgH C region is made up of three C domains, CH1, CH2, CH3, optionally CH4 (Cµ), and a hinge region. The membrane-bound form of the IgH C region also has membrane and intracellular domains. The IgH constant region determines the isotype of the antibody, e.g. IgM, IgD, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA and IgE. It will be appreciated that non-human mammals encoding multiple Ig isotypes will be able to undergo isotype class switching. There are two types of IgL, Igκ and Igλ.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">A "Fab" domain or fragment comprises the N-terminal portion of the IgH, which includes the V region and the CH1 domain of the IgH, and the entire IgL. A "F(ab')<sub>2</sub>" domain comprises the Fab domain and a portion of the hinge region, wherein the 2 IgH are linked together via disulfide linkage in the middle hinge region. Both the Fab and F(ab')<sub>2</sub> are "antigen-binding fragments." The C-terminal portion of the IgH, comprising the CH2 and CH3 domains, is the "Fc" domain. The Fc domain is the portion of the Ig recognized by cell receptors, such as the FcR, and to which the complement-activating protein, C1q, binds. The lower hinge region, which is encoded in the 5' portion of the CH2 exon, provides flexibility within the antibody for binding to FcR receptors.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As used herein "chimeric antibody" refers to an antibody translated from a polynucleotide sequence containing both human and non-human mammal polynucleotide sequences. A "humanized" antibody is one which is produced by a non-human cell or mammal and comprises human sequences, e.g., a chimeric antibody. Humanized antibodies are less immunogenic after administration to humans when compared to nonhumanized antibodies prepared from another species. In addition, the humanized antibodies of the present invention can be isolated from a knock-in non-human mammal engineered to produce fully human antibody molecules. For example, a humanized antibody may comprise the human variable region of a chimeric antibody appended to a human constant region to produce a fully human antibody.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">As used herein "chimeric Ig chain" refers to an Ig heavy chain or an Ig light chain translated from a polynucleotide sequence containing both human and non-human animal polynucleotide sequences. For example, a chimeric Ig heavy chain may comprise human VH, DH, JH, and CH1 gene segments and mouse CH2 and CH3 gene segments.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">"Polypeptide," "peptide" or "protein" are used interchangeably to describe a chain of amino acids that are linked together by chemical bonds. A polypeptide or protein may be an IgH, IgL, V domain, C domain, or an antibody.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">"Polynucleotide" refers to a chain of nucleic acids that are linked together by chemical bonds. Polynucleotides include, but are not limited to, DNA, cDNA, RNA, mRNA, and gene sequences and segments. Polynucleotides may be isolated from a living source such as a eukaryotic cell, prokaryotic cell or virus, or may be derived through in vitro manipulation by using standard techniques of molecular biology, or by DNA synthesis, or by a combination of a number of techniques.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">"Locus" refers to a location on a chromosome that comprises one or more genes or exons, such as an IgH or Igκ locus, the cis regulatory elements, and the binding regions to which <i>trans</i>-acting factors bind. As used herein, "gene" or "gene segment" refers to the polynucleotide sequence<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> encoding a specific polypeptide or portion thereof, such as a VL domain, a CH1 domain, an upper hinge region, or a portion thereof. As used herein, "gene segment" and "exon" may be used interchangeably and refer to the polynucleotide encoding a peptide, or a portion thereof. A gene, or gene segment, may further comprise one or more introns, transcriptional control elements, e.g., promoter, enhancers, or non-coding regions, e.g., cis regulatory elements, e.g., 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions, poly-adenylation sites.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The term "endogenous" refers to a polynucleotide sequence which occurs naturally within the cell or animal. "Orthologous" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the corresponding polypeptide in another species, <i>i.e</i>. a human CH1 domain and a mouse CH1 domain. The term "syngeneic" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that is found within the same species that may be introduced into an animal of that same species, i.e. a mouse Vκ gene segment introduced into a mouse Igκ locus.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">As used herein, the term "homologous" or "homologous sequence" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that has a highly similar sequence, or high percent identity (<i>e.g</i>. 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more), to another polynucleotide sequence or segment thereof. For example, a DNA construct of the invention may comprise a sequence that is homologous to a portion of an endogenous DNA sequence to facilitate recombination at that specific location. Homologous recombination may take place in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">As used herein, "flanking sequence" or "flanking DNA sequence" refers to a DNA sequence adjacent to the non-endogenous DNA sequence in a DNA construct that is homologous to an endogenous DNA sequence or a previously recombined non-endogenous sequence, or a portion thereof. DNA constructs of the invention may have one or more flanking sequences, <i>e.g</i>., a flanking sequence on the 3' and 5' end of the non-endogenous sequence or a flanking sequence on the 3' or the 5' end of the non-endogenous sequence.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">The phrase "homologous recombination-competent cell" refers to a cell that is capable of homologously recombining DNA fragments that contain<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> regions of overlapping homology. Examples of homologous recombination-competent cells include, but are not limited to, induced pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, bacteria, yeast, various cell lines and embryonic stem (ES) cells.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">"Non-human mammal" refers to an animal other than humans which belongs to the class Mammalia. Examples of non-human mammals include, but are not limited to, non-human primates, rodents, bovines, ovines, equines, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, dolphins, bats, rabbits, and marsupials. Preferred non-human mammals rely primarily on gene conversion and/or somatic hypermutation to generate antibody diversity, e.g., mouse, rabbit, pig, sheep, goat, and cow. Particularly preferred non-human mammals are mice.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The term "knock-in" or "transgenic" refers to a cell or animal comprising a polynucleotide sequence, e.g., a transgene, derived from another species incorporated into its genome. For example, a mouse which contains a human VH gene segment integrated into its genome outside the endogenous mouse IgH locus is a transgenic mouse; a mouse which contains a human VH gene segment integrated into its genome replacing an endogenous mouse VH in the endogenous mouse IgH locus is a transgenic or a knock-in mouse. In knock-in cells and non-human mammals, the polynucleotide sequence derived from another species, may replace the corresponding, or orthologous, endogenous sequence originally found in the cell or non-human mammal.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">A "humanized" animal, as used herein refers to a non-human animal, e.g., a mouse that has a composite genetic structure that retains gene sequences of the mouse or other non-human animal, in addition to one or more gene segments and or gene regulatory sequences of the original genetic makeup having been replaced with analogous human sequences.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">As used herein, the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule into which another nucleic acid fragment can be integrated without loss of the vector's ability to replicate. Vectors may originate from a virus, a plasmid or the cell of a higher organism. Vectors are utilized to introduce foreign or recombinant DNA into a host cell, wherein the vector is replicated.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">A polynucleotide agent can be contained in a vector, which can facilitate manipulation of the polynucleotide, including introduction of the polynucleotide into a target cell. The vector can be a cloning vector, which is useful for maintaining the polynucleotide, or can be an expression vector, which contains, in addition to the polynucleotide, regulatory elements useful for expressing the polynucleotide and, where the polynucleotide encodes an RNA, for expressing the encoded RNA in a particular cell, either for subsequent translation of the RNA into a polypeptide or for subsequent <i>trans</i> regulatory activity by the RNA in the cell. An expression vector can contain the expression elements necessary to achieve, for example, sustained transcription of the encoding polynucleotide, or the regulatory elements can be operatively linked to the polynucleotide prior to its being cloned into the vector.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">An expression vector (or the polynucleotide) generally contains or encodes a promoter sequence, which can provide constitutive or, if desired, inducible or tissue specific or developmental stage specific expression of the encoding polynucleotide, a poly-A recognition sequence, and a ribosome recognition site or internal ribosome entry site, or other regulatory elements such as an enhancer, which can be tissue specific. The vector also can contain elements required for replication in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host system or both, as desired. Such vectors, which include plasmid vectors and viral vectors such as bacteriophage, baculovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, alpha virus and adeno-associated virus vectors, are well known and can be purchased from a commercial source (Promega, Madison Wis.; Stratagene, La Jolla Calif.; GIBCO/BRL, Gaithersburg Md.) or can be constructed by one skilled in the art (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="b"><text>Meth.

<p id="p0078" num="0078">A DNA vector utilized in the methods of the invention can contain positive and negative selection markers. Positive and negative markers can be genes that when expressed confer drug resistance to cells expressing these<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> genes. Suitable selection markers for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can include, but are not limited to: Km (Kanamycin resistant gene), tetA (tetracycline resistant gene) and betalactamase (ampicillin resistant gene). Suitable selection markers for mammalian cells in culture can include, but are not limited to: hyg (hygromycin resistance gene), puro (puromycin resistance gene) and G418 (neomycin resistance gene). The selection markers also can be metabolic genes that can convert a substance into a toxic substance. For example, the gene thymidine kinase when expressed converts the drug gancyclovir into a toxic product. Thus, treatment of cells with gancylcovir can negatively select for genes that do not express thymidine kinase.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">In a related aspect, the selection markers can be "screenable markers," such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), GFP-like proteins, and luciferase.</p>

A DNA vector can be any suitable DNA vector, including a plasmid, cosmid, bacteriophage, p1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), or mammalian artificial chromosome (MAC). In certain embodiments, the DNA vector is a BAC. The various DNA vectors are selected as appropriate for the size of DNA inserted in the construct. In one embodiment, the DNA constructs are bacterial artificial chromosomes or fragments thereof.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">The term "bacterial artificial chromosome" or "BAC" as used herein refers to a bacterial DNA vector. BACs, such as those derived from <i>E</i>. <i>coli,</i> may be utilized for introducing, deleting or replacing DNA sequences of non-human mammalian cells or animals via homologous recombination. <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can maintain complex genomic DNA as large as 350 kb in the form of BACs (see <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Shizuya and Kouros-Mehr, Keio J Med. 2001, 50(1):26-30</text></nplcit>), with greater DNA stability than cosmids or yeast artificial chromosomes.

<p id="p0082" num="0082">DNA fragments comprising an Ig locus, or a portion thereof, to be incorporated into the non-human mammal are isolated from the same species of non-human mammal prior to humanization of the locus. Multiple BACs containing overlapping fragments of an Ig locus can be humanized and the overlapping fragments recombine to generate a continuous IgH or IgL locus. The resulting chimeric Ig locus comprises the human gene segments operably linked to the non-human mammal Ig gene segments to produce a functional Ig locus, wherein the locus is capable of undergoing gene rearrangement and thereby producing a diversified repertoire of chimeric antibodies.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">These processes for recombining BACs and/or of engineering a chimeric Ig locus or fragment thereof requires that a bacterial cell, such as <i>E</i>. <i>coli,</i> be transformed with a BAC containing the host Ig locus or a portion thereof. The BAC containing bacillus is then transformed with a recombination vector comprising the desired human Ig gene segment linked to flanking homology sequence shared with the BAC containing the host Ig locus or portion thereof. The shared sequence homology mediates homologous recombination and cross-over between the human Ig gene segment on the recombination vector and the non-human mammal Ig gene segment on the BAC. Detection of homologously recombined BACs may utilize selectable and/or screenable markers incorporated into the vector. Humanized BACs can be readily isolated from the bacteria and used for producing knock-in non-human cells. Methods of recombining BACs and engineering insertions and deletions within DNA on BACs and methods for producing genetically modified mice therefrom are documented.

<p id="p0086" num="0086">The process for recombining BACs to make larger and/or tailored BACs comprising portions of the Ig loci requires that a bacterial cell, such as <i>E</i>. <i>coli,</i> be transformed with a BAC carrying a first Ig locus, a portion thereof, or some other target sequence.

<heading id="h0010"><u>Knock-in Non-Human Mammals and Cells</u></heading>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">Knock-in non-human mammals and cells of the present invention comprise altered IgH or IgL, or both, loci comprising orthologous human Ig gene segments, which replace the endogenous gene segments. For example,<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> in specific embodiments a human CH1 domain which replaces a CH1 domain in a specific endogenous CH gene, e.g., Cµ, Cδ, Cγ, may be an orthologous sequence for each mouse CH region. For each of the endogenous Cγ genes, the replacing CH1 may be an orthologous human CH1 or may be a single Cγ from human CH genes from human IgG isotype more frequently used in therapeutic mAbs, typically Cγ1, Cγ2 or Cγ4, so as to better facilitate in vivo maturation of human V domain in the context of a more clinically relevant human CH1 domain.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">Optionally, the upper hinge sequences of the endogenous C genes may also be replaced with the orthologous human C hinge sequences, respectively. Alternatively, the upper and middle hinge sequences of the endogenous C genes may also be replaced with the orthologous human C hinge sequences, respectively. If human middle hinge regions are used, the human Cy4 middle hinge sequence may be engineered to contain a proline at residue at position 229 rather than a serine in order to drive inter-heavy chain dimerization via disulfide bonds. The lower hinge regions, part of the CH2 domain, of the endogenous Cγ genes would be left as is to facilitate optimal binding to endogenous FcγR. This engineering will produce human heavy chain Fab domain, Fab domain plus upper hinge, or F(ab')<sub>2</sub> if the upper and middle hinge regions are also converted to human, that will be more likely to retain optimal characteristics upon conversion to fully human IgG.</p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">BACs comprising the endogenous IgH loci downstream of the J gene cluster and each retained C gene with the human CH1-endogenous CH2-CH3 (and CH4 for Cµ) and membrane and intracellular domain exons will be homologously recombined into the endogenous IgH locus in homologous recombination-competent cells, such as mouse ES cells, either as a first introduction step to be followed by replacement of the endogenous V-D-J genes with their human orthologs or in the opposite order, introduction of human V, D and J followed by endogenous C genes engineered as described above. The content on the Ig locus on the BAC is not restricted to only C gene segments on one and V, D and J gene segments on the other. The BAC with the C gene<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> segments may also contain J gene segments and even D gene segments and even one or more V gene segments. Alternatively, the BAC with V gene segments may contain D gene segments and even J gene segments and even one or more C gene segments.</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">BACs carrying the constant region genes may be engineered in E. <i>coli</i> or synthesized in vitro prior to introduction into ES cells so as to delete any unwanted gene segments, such as the Cε and Cα genes. This would constrain the knock-in animals to make Cµ, and Cδ for primary immune responses and Cγ isotypes for secondary, affinity-matured immune responses, from which therapeutic antibody candidates would typically be recovered. The endogenous IgH 3' LCR may be left unaltered.</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">A similar replacement strategy would be employed for the endogenous Igκ locus except that the complete human Cκ gene could optionally also be incorporated in the BAC so as to replace the endogenous Cκ locus, thus producing fully human Igκ chains. The human Cλ locus could also be incorporated in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">Yet another aspect of the invention comprises incorporating fully human Ig loci including the human C regions, in place of the complete endogenous Ig loci. In this embodiment, the cluster of endogenous FcR genes is also replaced with the orthologous cluster of human FcR genes using similar BAC-based genetic engineering in homologous recombination competent cells, such as mouse ES cells. The cluster of endogenous FcyR genes can be replaced in the same ES cell in which the human IgH locus or portions thereof have replaced the endogenous locus or in a separate ES cell. In the latter instance, mice would be derived from said ES cells and bred with mice carrying the engineered Ig locus (loci) so as to produce mice that make human IgG antibodies that bind to human FcyR in place of mouse FcyR genes. In either way fully human antibodies would be produced and during an immune response would be able to engage the human FcR receptors normally. Such knock-in animals would also have the benefit of being useful for testing for the activity and effector function of human therapeutic mAb candidates in models of<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> disease when bred onto the appropriate genetic background for the model, i.e., SCID, nu/nu, nod, and Ipr mice. Further, the human target gene sequence can replace the endogenous gene using BAC targeting technology in homologous recombination-competent cells, providing models for target validation and functional testing of the antibody. In this instance, the human CH genes may be engineered to have cytoplasmic and/or membrane domain gene segments from mouse or other orthologous species to facilitate native signal transduction in the B cell.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">In addition, another aspect of the invention relates to the design of the desired human V region. In particular, an entire human V domain repertoire or a portion thereof may be incorporated into the genome of the cell, or a tailored V domain repertoire may be incorporated. For example, in certain embodiments it is preferred to omit V domain gene segments that are missing from some human haplotypes and instead tailoring the V domain repertoire to be composed of only the functional V gene segments common across all known human haplotypes. Doing so provides antibody drug candidates with V domains that are better immune tolerized across all potential patients, thereby preventing the induction of a dangerous immune response upon administration of the encoded antibody to a subject. One or more V domain gene segments may be incorporated.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">In preferred embodiments of the invention, BACs containing the desired Ig loci gene segments are used to incorporate this genetic information into the target cell via homologous recombination. The nature of BAC engineering in E. <i>coli</i> provides additional opportunities to finely tailor the immunoglobulin loci prior to introduction into competent cells. For example, the human DH cluster can be replaced or supplemented with D genes from other species, such as from non-human primates, rabbits, rat, hamster etc. BAC libraries and the complete sequence of the Ig loci are available for many species. D gene segments within the IgH loci can be defined from publicly available sequence or genetic structure information, or by testing using appropriate D specific probes or primers. The orthologous D gene clusters or<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> portions thereof can be homologously recombined into the BACs or assembled in silico and then synthesized, therein replacing or adding to the cluster of human D gene segments. Because of the significant diversification that occurs in making the complementarity determining region -3 (CDR3) and because the structure of the V region is such that the CDR3 is usually solvent inaccessible, immunogenicity to the CDR3 sequence is of less concern. Therefore, amino acids encoded by non-human D genes incorporated into the CDR3 are less likely to be immunogenic. Non-human D genes could confer an advantage by producing novel CDR3 structures that would expand the range of epitope specificities and affinities in a panel of antigen-specific antibodies, therein broadening the quality of activities mediated by a panel of mAbs.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">Similarly, the JH gene cluster, i.e., one or more JH gene segments, can be from a species other than human due to the relative sequence conservation across mammals. The JH gene segment may be derived from any mammal, e.g., human, non-human primate, rabbit, sheep, rat, hamster, and mouse. In particular embodiments, the JH gene segment is human.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">After engineering the Ig loci into homologous recombination-competent cells to replace portions or all of the endogenous Ig loci, genetically engineered non-human mammals, such as mice, can be produced by nowstandard methods such as blastocyst microinjection followed by breeding of chimeric animals, morula aggregation or cloning methodologies, such as somatic cell nuclear transfer. For example, mice with modified IgH and IgL loci can be bred to produce homozygous IgH and IgL (either Igκ or Igλ). Multi-stage breeding would produce animals homozygous for modified IgH, Igκ and Igλ loci. Animals heterozygous for IgH and IgL loci, which would produce both fullymouse and human-mouse antibodies, can also be used to generate antigen-specific human V-mouse C mAbs, though somewhat less efficiently than using homozygous animals because there would also be production of antibody from the active endogenous Ig loci. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for just one altered locus, e.g, IgH, could also be useful as a source of human VH domains<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> (VH-CH1) for antibody display libraries and when mixed with VL domains from mice heterozygous or homozygous for an altered IgL locus, especially if the mice were immunized (see below). For example, an antibody display library from two separate mice - one with human VH-CH1-mouse CH2-CH3 and the other with human VK-CK - could be used to recover fully human antibodies using well-established techniques in molecular biology. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for more than one altered locus, e.g., IgH and Igκ, would also be useful as a source of human VH and VL domains for antibody display libraries.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">Certain embodiments provide a method of producing a knock-in non-human mammal having a genome encoding human VH and CH1 gene segments and a human Ig light chain locus comprising the steps of breeding a non-human mammal comprising a chimeric Ig heavy chain locus, wherein the Ig heavy chain locus comprises the human VH and CH1 gene segments, with a non-human mammal comprising a human Ig light chain locus; selecting offspring having a genome comprising the chimeric Ig heavy chain locus and the human Ig light chain locus; further breeding the offspring; and producing offspring having a genome homozygous for the chimeric heavy and human light chain loci. In related embodiments, the genome of the mammal also encodes a human JH gene segment.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">This genetic engineering strategy can also be applied to engineering of animals other than mice so as to express human sequence V regions coupled with xenogeneic C regions, or completely human antibodies, or some intermediate thereof. For animals for which there is a current lack of ES cell technology for genetic engineering through blastocyst microinjection or morula aggregation, the endogenous loci can be modified in cells amenable to various cloning technologies or developmental reprogramming (e.g., induced pluripotent stem cells, IPS). The increased frequency of homologous recombination provided by the BAC technology provides the ability to find doubly replaced loci in the cells, and cloned animals derived therefrom would be homozygous for the mutation, therein saving time and costs especially when breeding large animals with long generation times. Iterative replacements in<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> the cultured cells could provide all the requisite engineering at multiple loci and then direct production of animals using cloning or IPS technology, without cross-breeding to get the appropriate genotypes. The ability to finely tailor the introduced Ig genes and also finely specify the sites into which they are introduced provides the ability to engineer enhancements that would provide better function. Engineered animals such as goats, bovines, ovines, equines, rabbits, dogs etc. would be a source of fully human polyclonal antibodies.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">Furthermore, if the BACs were engineered in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> with the DNA components required for chromosome function, e.g., telomeres and a centromere, preferably, but not required, of the recipient species for optimal function, e.g., mouse telomeres and a mouse centromere, they can be introduced into the recipient cell by electroporation, microinjection etc. and would function as artificial chromosomes. These BAC-based artificial chromosomes also could be used as a foundation for subsequent rounds of homologous recombination for building up larger artificial chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">The engineered Ig locus or loci described herein on vectors such as plasm ids, BACs or YACs can also be used as standard transgenes introduced via microinjection into the pronucleus of an embryo such as mouse, rabbit, rat, or hamster. Several BACs, YACs, plasmids or any combination thereof can be co-microinjected and will co-integrate to make a functional locus. Various methods known in the art can be used to inactivate the endogenous Ig loci and the animals with an engineered Ig transgene bred with those with one or more inactivated endogenous loci to derive genotypes expressing antibodies from the transgene and without production of the complete native immunoglobulin from the inactivated endogenous loci.</p>
<heading id="h0011"><u>Antibodies</u></heading>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">Animals carrying the modified loci can be immunized with target antigens using various techniques in the art. Target antigens may be selected for the treatment or prevention of a particular disease or disorder, such as various types of cancer, graft versus host disease, cardiovascular disease and<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> associated disorders, neurological diseases and disorders, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, and pathogenic infections. In other embodiments, target antigens may be selected to develop an antibody that would be useful as a diagnostic agent for the detection one of the above diseases or disorders.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">Antigen-specific repertoires can be recovered from immunized mice by hybridoma technology, single-cell RT-PCR for selected B cells, by antibody display technologies, and other methods known in the art. For example, to recover mAbs from mouse-derived hybridomas, a human V-CH1-mouse hinge+CH2+CH3 antibody or a human V-CH1-upper/middle hingemouse lower hinge+CH2+CH3 antibody (depending upon the IgH locus engineering) would be secreted into the culture supernatant and can be purified by means known in the art such as column chromatography using protein A, protein G, etc. Such purified antibody can be used for further testing and characterization of the antibody to determine potency in vitro and in vivo, affinity etc.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">In addition, since they can be detected with anti-mouse constant region secondary agents, the human V-CH1 (upper/middle hinge)-mouse CH2-CH3 mAb may be useful for immunochemistry assays of human tissues to assess tissue distribution and expression of the target antigen. This feature of the chimeric antibodies of the present invention allows for specificity confirmation of the mAb over fully human mAbs because of occasional challenges in using anti-human constant region secondary detecting agents against tissues that contain normal human Ig and from the binding of human Fc regions to human FcR expressed on cells in some tissues.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">The human variable regions of the mAbs can be recovered and sequenced by standard methods. Either before or after identifying lead candidate mAbs, the genes, either genomic DNA or cDNAs, for the human VH and VL domains can be recovered by various molecular biology methods, such as RT-PCR, and then appended to DNA encoding the remaining portion of the human constant region, therein producing fully human mAb. The DNAs encoding the now fully human VH-CH and human VL-CL would be cloned into<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> suitable expression vectors known in the art or that can be custom-built and transfected into mammalian cells, yeast cells such as Pichia, other fungi etc. to secrete antibody into the culture supernatant. Other methods of production such as ascites using hybridoma cells in mice, transgenic animals that secrete the antibody into milk or eggs, and transgenic plants that make antibody in the fruit, roots or leaves can also be used for expression. The fully human recombinant antibody can be purified by various methods such as column chromatography using protein A, protein G etc.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">The purified antibody can be lyophilized for storage or formulated into various solutions known in the art for solubility and stability and consistent with safe administration into animals, including humans. Purified recombinant antibody can be used for further characterization using in vitro assays for efficacy, affinity, specificity, etc., animal models for efficacy, toxicology and pharmacokinetics etc. Further, purified antibody can be administered to humans for clinical purposes such as therapies and diagnostics for disease.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">Various fragments of the human V-CH1 -(upper/middle hinge)-endogenous CH2-CH3 mAbs can be isolated by methods including enzymatic cleavage, recombinant technologies, etc. for various purposes including reagents, diagnostics and therapeutics. The cDNA for the human variable domains + CH1 or just the human variable domains can be isolated from the engineered non-human mammals described above, specifically from RNA from secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen and lymph nodes, and the VH and VL cDNAs implemented into various antibody display systems such as phage, ribosome, <i>E. coli,</i> yeast, mammalian etc. The knock-in mammals may be immunologically naive or optimally may be immunized against an antigen of choice. By using appropriate PCR primers, such as 5' in the leader region or framework 1 of the variable domain and 3' in the human CH1 of Cγ genes, the somatically matured V regions can be recovered in order to display solely the affinity matured repertoire. The displayed antibodies can be selected against the target antigen to efficiently recover high-affinity antigen-specific fully human<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> Fv or Fabs, and rid of the knock-in mammal of CH2-CH3 domains that would be present if mAbs were recovered directly from the knock-in mammals.</p>

<heading id="h0016">DESIGN OF BACs IN E. <i>COLI</i></heading>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">As described in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US20040128703"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0128703</text></patcit>, the manipulation of BACs in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> provides a powerful tool for fine tailoring of the genomic DNA carried in the BACs. For example, to replace mouse CH1 with human CH1 in one or more of the mouse constant region genes, e.g., Cγ1 or all mouse Cγ genes or mouse Cµ, Cδ and all the mouse Cγ genes, a modified mouse BAC is made in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and then used for homologous recombination in ES cells. For example, in the targeting BAC, the mouse CH1 exons of at least one and up to all of the Cγ genes are replaced by the human CH1 exons. This replacement is similarly performed in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> using a homologous recombination method. The resulting modified BAC has a germ line-configured segment carrying the human D region, the human J region, and downstream mouse Cµ region, Cδ region, Cγ3 region (mouse CH1 of γ3 is replaced by human CH1), modified Cγ1 region (mouse CH1 of γ1 is replaced by human CH1), modified Cγ2B region (mouse CH1 of γ2B is replaced by<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> human CH1), and modified Cγ2C (mouse CH1 of γ2C is replaced by human CH1). This strategy can also be used to modify the CH1 exons of Cµ, and Cδ genes. Other precise replacements such as the upper and middle hinge region coding sequence with human for mouse can also be made. Further finely tailored changes including as small as single codon and single nucleotide changes can be engineered into the replacing DNA.</p>
<heading id="h0017"><u>EXAMPLE 2</u></heading>
<heading id="h0018">HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION OF BACs IN <i>E. COLI</i></heading>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">A BAC vector is based on the F-factor found in <i>E</i>. <i>coli.</i> The F-factor and the BAC vector derived from it are maintained as low copy plasm ids, generally found as one or two copies per cell depending upon its life cycle. Both F-factor and BAC vector show the fi<sup>+</sup> phenotype, which excludes an additional copy of the plasmid in the cell. By this mechanism, when <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> already carries and maintains one BAC, and then an additional BAC is introduced into the <i>E</i>. <i>coli,</i> the cell maintains only one BAC, either the BAC previously existing in the cell or the external BAC newly introduced. This feature is extremely useful for selectively isolating BACs homologously recombined as described below.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">The homologous recombination in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> requires the functional RecA gene product. In this example, the RecA gene has a temperaturesensitive mutation so that the RecA protein is only functional when the incubation temperature is below 37°C. When the incubation temperature is above 37°C, the Rec A protein is non-functional or has greatly reduced recombination activity. This temperature sensitive recombination allows manipulation of RecA function in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> so as to activate conditional homologous recombination only when it is desired. It is also possible to obtain, select or engineer cold-sensitive mutations of Rec A protein such that the protein is only functional above a certain temperature, e.g., 37°C. In that condition, the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> would be grown at a lower temperature, albeit with a slower generation time, and recombination would be triggered by incubating at<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> above 37°C for a short period of time to allow only a short interval of recombination.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">Homologous recombination in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> is carried out by providing overlapping DNA substrates that are found in two circular BACs. The first BAC (BAC1) carries the contiguous segments from A through E, and the second BAC (BAC2) carries the contiguous segments from E through I. The segment E carried by both BACs is the overlapping segment where the DNA crossover occurs, and as a result it produces a recombinant that carries the contiguous segments from A through I.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">BAC1 described above is the one already present in the cell, and when BAC2 is introduced into the cell, either BAC1 or BAC2 can exist in the cell, not both BACs. Upon electroporation of BAC2 into the cell, the temperature would be lowered below 37°C so as to permit conditional RecA activity, therein mediating homologous recombination. If BAC1 and BAC2 have a selectable marker each and the markers are distinctively different, for example, BAC1 carries Kan (a gene conferring kanamycin resistance) and BAC2 carries Amp (a gene giving Ampicilin resistance), only the recombinant BAC grows in the presence of both antibiotics Kan and Amp.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">Since there are two E gene segments at the separate region of the recombinant BAC, the E segment flanked by two vectors must be removed by one of two ways, one is by homologous recombination at either the vectors or the E region, and the other is carried out by loxP site specific recombination by CRE recombinase. The resolved BAC has now the contiguous stretch from A through I with single copy of E.</p>
<heading id="h0019"><u>EXAMPLE 3</u></heading>
<heading id="h0020">HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION IN <i>E</i>. <i>COLI</i></heading>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">According to the procedure detailed above, BAC1 and BAC2 undergo recombination in <i>E</i>. <i>coli.</i> BAC1 and BAC2 have 156,427 bp and 122,500 bp, respectively, and they overlap by 42,363 bp. The size of the resulting BAC after recombination and resolution is 236,564 bp. BAC2<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> containing an Amp gene in the BAC vector or in the appropriate area of the BAC is introduced into an <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> bacillus carrying BAC1 having a Kan gene in the BAC vector or in the appropriate area of the BAC.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">The introduction of a BAC to <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> cell is typically done by electroporation. Prior to electroporation, the cells are maintained at 40°C, a non-permissive temperature for recombination, and after electroporation the cells are incubated at 30°C, a temperature permissive for recombination. During the incubation, homologous recombination occurs and cells express enzymes necessary to become resistant to both antibiotics. The incubation period is about 45 to 90 minutes. Then the cells are spread on the media plates containing both antibiotics and the plates are incubated at 40°C to prevent further homologous recombination. The majority of colony isolates growing on the media plates have the recombined BAC that has predicted size. This can be confirmed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis. Integrity of the recombined DNA is confirmed with restriction digests using rare-cutting and infrequent cutting restriction enzyme digests analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.</p>
<heading id="h0021"><u>EXAMPLE 4</u></heading>
<heading id="h0022">DESIGN OF A BAC TO REPLACE ENDOGENOUS CH1 WITH HUMAN CH1</heading>
<p id="p0136" num="0136">In this example, two BACs (173, 869 bp and 102,413 bp) overlap by 6,116 bp recombine to produce a 270,165 bp BAC. To replace mouse CH1 in the mouse BAC with human CH1, an appropriate DNA construct is made. The construct is made by chemical synthesis, PCR, conventional cloning techniques or a combination of these methods. The construct has a human CH1 sequence flanked by mouse sequence arms that, in the mouse genome, flank the mouse CH1 region as well.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">The construct is recombined in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> with the original mouse BAC at one or the other side of the homologous flanking mouse DNA sequences, and after repeated recombination and resolution by Cre recombinase, a chimeric BAC having human CH1 replacing mouse CH1 is<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> made. By repeating this process, all of the mouse CH1 regions of the Cγ genes are replaced with human CH1 regions, producing a modified BAC carrying all of the Cγ genes having human CH1 in place of the mouse CH1.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">Similarly, the mouse CH1 domains of Cµ, Cδ can be replaced by the corresponding human CH1 domains. If desired, Cα and Cε can also be modified in this manner. Similar replacement(s) can also be performed with the upper and/or middle hinge segments of the C gene(s). If incorporating a human middle hinge region, the human Cy4 middle hinge encoding DNA sequence can be engineered, such as by chemical synthesis, with a codon encoding proline replacing the codon encoding serine 229 to effect interchain rather than intrachain disulfide bind formation to stabilize the IgG4 dimer.</p>
<heading id="h0023"><u>EXAMPLE 5</u></heading>
<heading id="h0024">INTRODUCTION OF BACs INTO CELLS</heading>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">In preparation for introduction into ES cells, mammalian expression cassettes for selectable markers and for screenable markers can be recombined onto the BACs. Such cassettes carry genes with required regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and poly-adenylation sites for expression of the genes in mammalian cells, such as mouse ES cells. The genes on the cassette can be selectable markers such as drug-resistance and drug-sensitivity genes for drugs such as G418, hygromycin, puromycin, gancyclovir (thymidine kinase), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase etc. and screenable markers such as green-fluorescent protein (GFP), redfluorescent protein (RFP), luciferase etc. Such markers are used to select and screen for cells into which the BAC has been introduced and homologously recombined.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">For introduction into ES cells, BAC DNA is purified from <i>E. coli</i> and the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> genomic DNA by methods known in the art such as the alkaline lysis method, commercial DNA purification kits, CsCI density gradient, sucrose gradient, or agarose gel electrophoresis, which may be followed by treatment with agarase. To linearize the purified DNA, it is then digested by Notl. The<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> two Notl sites flank the cloning site on the BAC vector and thus Notl digestion separates the insert from the vector. The insert DNA is free from the vector DNA, which has a loxP site, except the small region between the cloning site and Notl site. Thus, the DNA to be transfected into the mammalian cell does not carry a loxP site unless one is purposely engineered into the DNA to be transfected into the mammalian cell. Although Notl site is extremely rare on human and mouse immunoglobulin genomic DNA, if the BAC DNA construct contains one or more Notl sites, sites for other rare restriction enzymes such as Ascl, AsiSl, Fsel, Pacl, Pmel, Sbfl, and Swal, homing endonucleases such as l-Ceul, l-Scel, Pl-Pspl,Pl-Scel, or lambda terminase will be introduced into the junction area between the insert and the vector. This can be accomplished by transposon, homologous recombination, and other cloning methods. The linearized DNA, typically 0.1 - 10 µg of DNA depending upon the size, are introduced into the mammalian cells, such as ES cells, by methods known in the art such as transfection, lipofection, electroporation, Ca-precipitation or direct nuclear microinjection.</p>

<heading id="h0026">ENGINEERING OF IG LOCI VIA INCORPORATION OF LARGE BACs VIA SEQUENTIAL REPLACEMENT IN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS</heading>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Homologous recombination in <i>E</i>. <i>coli to</i> construct larger BACs is described in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US20040128703"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0128703</text></patcit>. Such methods can be used to make BACs with larger inserts of DNA than is represented by the average size of inserts of currently available BAC libraries. Such larger inserts can comprise DNA representing the human Ig loci such IgH, Igκ and lgλ The DNA inserts can also comprise DNA representing the endogenous Ig loci including some or all of the DNA representing the constant region genes, which also may carry modifications designed into the DNA.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">As an example, using such longer BACs, the region containing the human IgH V, D and J gene segments is covered by only 3 to 4 separate BACs, each of which would be approximately ∼300 kb in size (<figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figure 1</figref>). The<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> region containing the mouse IgH constant region gene segments from downstream of the JH gene segment cluster through just upstream of the mouse 3' locus control region can be covered in a single BAC of 170-180 kb. These BACs also carry overlapping segments to provide homology with the subsequent BAC for homologous recombination in cells such as ES cells. Using these longer BACs, the V, D and J gene segments of the mouse IgH are sequentially replaced with the corresponding human sequences and the constant region gene segments of the mouse IgH are replaced with engineered human-mouse constant region gene segments. The sequential replacements are substantially complete to the desired amount.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">The first BAC to be introduced into ES cells may be comprised of human Ig DNA flanked on either side by 1 kb to 10 kb to 100 kb or more of mouse DNA from the corresponding endogenous mouse genome in the ES cell. The first BAC then replaces a portion of the endogenous mouse genome by homologous recombination in ES cells, replacing the endogenous mouse DNA between the two flanking DNAs, which are the targeting sites, with the human DNA engineered between the flanking DNAs on the BAC. For example, by constructing in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> a BAC that contains a known size in kilobases of human IgH DNA that contains human variable regions, the DH gene cluster and the JH cluster, flanked on the 3' end by mouse DNA corresponding to the region 3' of the mouse JH locus and flanked 5' by mouse DNA corresponding to the region the same known size in kilobases 5' of the mouse JH cluster, and introducing the purified BAC into mouse ES cells to allow for homologous recombination, the corresponding mouse VH, DH and JH genes would be replaced by the orthologous human DNA.</p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">The flanking mouse DNAs could also be further away, e.g., the 5' homology could be upstream of the most 5' endogenous VH gene so that upon homologous recombination, the entire mouse VH-DH-JH region would be replaced by the human VH-DH-JH on the BAC. In other words, the length of the region of the endogenous DNA to be replaced is determined by the distance between the two flanking mouse segments on the BAC. The distance is not the<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> actual length between the flanking mouse segments in the BAC; rather it is the distance between the flanking mouse segments in the endogenous mouse chromosome. This distance may be calculated from the available genomic databases, such as UCSC Genomic Bioinformatics, NCBI and others known in the art.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">A second, and any subsequent, BAC would have two segments flanking the DNA to be introduced. For the two flanking DNAs, one is comprised of human DNA that corresponds to all or a portion of the human DNA introduced into the cell genome in the first replacement and the other is mouse DNA corresponding to endogenous DNA upstream (or downstream as the case may be) of the region to be replaced in the second introduction.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">Upon introduction into a homologous recombination-competent cell such as a mouse ES cell into which a first BAC DNA has replaced a portion of the endogenous locus, e.g., into the mouse IgH locus, one crossover would occur between the human flanking sequence of the BAC and the human sequence in the modified mouse chromosome, and the other between the mouse sequence of the BAC and the corresponding mouse region of said chromosome (see <figref idref="f0002">Figure 1B</figref> and <figref idref="f0003">Figure 1C</figref>). Put another way, in the second BAC, the human flanking sequence includes a homologous segment to the end portion of the human DNA sequence of the first BAC previously integrated into the chromosome.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">In this way, when they are joined by homologous recombination in ES cells, the joined segments become a contiguous segment. Such a segment may be germ line-configured as it is naturally found in humans or because of purposely engineered insertions, deletions or rearrangements may have a configuration different from germline. The mouse flanking sequence in the second BAC corresponds to the mouse endogenous chromosomal DNA that is a specified, desired distance away from the newly introduced human sequence in the mouse chromosome. The distance between the two mouse segments are long enough so that the replacement of the mouse endogenous IgH is completed as planned after repeated homologous recombination.<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --></p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">For instance, using BACs with suitable human DNA inserts of the VH, DH, and JH loci and flanked with suitably located targeting DNAs, it would be possible to replace all of the endogenous mouse VH, DH and JH genes with their corresponding human counterparts with 2-3 sequential replacements with BACs suitably engineered in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> as outlined above to facilitate homologous recombination in mammalian cells, including ES cells, and therein leaving the human V-D-J genes operably linked to downstream mouse constant region loci. In a third, fourth or fifth replacement, using a BAC with a suitable human DNA insert carrying human Cµ, Cδ and Cγ genes and optionally Cα, Cε and the human 3' locus control region (LCR), and flanked by human and mouse DNAs corresponding to introduced and endogenous DNA, respectively, the endogenous mouse C regions can be replaced with their human counterparts.</p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">Alternatively, the genomic DNA comprising the constant region genes may be of mouse origin and may be engineered with desired modifications such as replacing the CH1 domain of all or selected mouse constant regions with human CH1 DNA, and/or upper and the optional middle hinge regions of some or all of the mouse C genes with corresponding human gene sequences, all flanked by appropriate targeting DNA as outlined above. Further, some of the mouse C regions, e.g., Cε and/or Cα and/or one and up to all of the Cγ gene segments, can be deleted such that the endogenous mouse 3' LCR would be in closer than germline proximity to the most 3' constant region on the BAC, and upon homologous recombination into the genome, effecting deletion of the endogenous C gene segments absent from the targeting BAC.</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">The order of introduction of the BACs and sequential replacements can be either distal to proximal or proximal to distal.</p>
<heading id="h0027"><u>EXAMPLE 7</u></heading>
<heading id="h0028">ENGINEERING OF IG LOCI VIA INCORPORATION OF LARGE BACS AND USE OF SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMBINASES IN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS</heading>
<p id="p0151" num="0151">Alternatively, sites for site-specific recombinases, such as loxP/CRE or frt/flp, can be employed to facilitate engineering of the Ig loci by<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> introducing site-specific recombinase recognition sequences into DNAs to be introduced on the homologous recombination vectors, and then when the site-specific recombinase is expressed or introduced, recombination will occur between the sequences, therein deleting the intervening sequences. In this way two or more non-overlapping BACs are incorporated into the endogenous Ig locus via homologous recombination. The 5' BAC contains a loxP or frt recognition sequence in its 3' region while the 3' BAC contains a loxP or frt site in its 5' region, and the remaining endogenous sequence between the newly introduce sequences is removed via site-specific recombination.</p>
<p id="p0152" num="0152">The BACs can be engineered to introduce loxP or frt sites that will flank the intervening sequences. Subsequently, expression of CRE or flp recombinase, respectively, in either the cells or the genetically engineered organism derived therefrom will trigger site-specific recombination between the loxP and frt sites, thereby deleting the intervening sequences (<figref idref="f0008 f0009 f0010">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idref="f0011 f0012 f0013">5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0153" num="0153">After homologously recombined clones incorporating the second BAC targeting vector in the precise location have been identified, including performance of assay, e.g., fluorescent in situ hybridization with DNA probes from the first and second BAC, to confirm cis integration of the second BAC on the chromosome carrying the first BAC integrant, the first and second BACs are separated by an amount of intervening endogenous DNA from the mouse locus. The amount and content of this intervening endogenous DNA is determined by the location of the 3' flanking DNA on the first BAC and the 5' flanking DNA on the second BAC. This remaining intervening portion of the mouse sequence contained between the loxP ore frt sites that were introduced by homologous recombination is removed by CRE recombinase or flp recombinase. Either CRE recombinase or flp recombinase can be transiently expressed in clones that have both correctly targeted BAC inserts. CRE recombinase or flp recombinase acts efficiently and precisely upon loxP site or flp sites, respectively, therein deleting the intervening DNA between said sites. Confirmation of deletion and precise joining of the two BACs, 3' of the first BAC<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> joined to the 5' of the second BAC, can be detected by Southern blots as described herein.</p>
<p id="p0154" num="0154">In yet another alternative, a lox P site and Cre recombinase can be used to selectively introduce a lox-site carrying exogenous DNA into a lox-P site already incorporated into the engineered Ig loci.

The DNA upstream of the mouse C region germline configured DNA (with the exception of CH1 domain replacement(s) and optionally upper and optionally also the middle hinge replacements) would be human DNA corresponding to a portion already integrated into the modified IgH locus and the downstream DNA would be mouse sequence 3' of the most 3' mouse Cγ on the replacing DNA to effect deletion of Cα and Cε and any Cγ gene segments but to leave unaffected the content of the mouse 3' LCR.

<p id="p0158" num="0158">A replacement strategy as outlined above can also be performed on an Igκ locus endogenous in a cell chromosome, for example, in a mouse ES cell. To replace the endogenous mouse Vκ genes with the corresponding human Vκ gene content, only two iterative replacements may be required. This is because the human Vκ gene content is redundant, with the human Vκ genes being represented about 2 times, with a proximal cluster oriented in the same 5'-3' orientation as the Jκ and Cκ gene and this cluster duplicated in a distal, inverted orientation. This inverted, duplicated cluster represents only about 10% of the expressed Vκ repertoire in humans. Further, this distal, inverted duplication is missing from about 10% of humans. Consequently, as little as two overlapping BACs could comprise the unique human Vκ repertoire plus human Jκ genes and the human Cκ gene as shown in <figref idref="f0004 f0005">Figure 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0159" num="0159">Alternatively, two non-overlapping BACs are homologously recombined into the Igκ locus, and each BAC introduces a site specific recombinase recognition sequence, such as IoxP or frt. The 5' BAC contains, for example, a site-specific recombination recognition site in its 3' region, and<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> the 3' BAC contains a site-specific recombination recognition site in its 5' region. Upon expression of the site-specific recombinase, the intervening mouse Igκ sequences between the two site-specific recombination recognition sites are deleted, thereby joining the sequences introduced by the BACs (<figref idref="f0011 f0012 f0013">Figure 5</figref>).</p>

<heading id="h0036">HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION OF THE IGλ LOCUS</heading>
<p id="p0160" num="0160">A replacement strategy as outlined above can also be performed on the Igλ locus endogenous in a cell chromosome, such as in a mouse ES cell. To replace the endogenous mouse Vλ genes with the corresponding human Vλ genes, only two iterative replacements may be required (<figref idref="f0006 f0007">Figure 3</figref>). However, because the genomic organization of the Igλ locus is different in mouse versus humans, an alternative engineering strategy must be pursued to implant the human Igλ Vλ-Jλ genes. In mice, the Igλ locus consists of two separate but linked gene clusters, each composed of one or two Vλ genes upstream of two paired Jλ-Cλ gene sets. The most upstream Vλ only very rarely rearranges to the most downstream Jλ-Cλ pair. In humans, there are approximately 30 functional Vλ genes upstream of 7 Jλ-Cλ clusters.</p>
<p id="p0161" num="0161">Furthermore, leaving the mouse constant regions, specifically the mouse Igλ 3' LCRs, Eλ2-4 and/or Eλ3-1, intact and unmodified would likely lead to an engineered locus that would fail to express at the 60/40 κ:λ ratio of humans and rather would more likely express at the 95/5 κ:λ ratio of mice because of mutations, probably causing defects in NF-κB binding, that are present in the mouse Igλ 3' LCRs (see, e.g., Combriato and Klobeck, <i>J</i>. <i>Immunol.</i> <u>168</u>:1259-1266). Because the human Igλ locus contributes a substantial amount of diversity to the total human light chain repertoire it is beneficial to appropriately engineer the human Igλ BAC to recapitulate the genuine human immune response so as to increase the efficiency and probability of generating therapeutically useful mAbs against a broad range of antigen targets.<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --></p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">Engineered BACs replace the endogenous mouse Igλ locus with the human counterpart and restore a more fully functional Igλ 3' LCR downstream of the constant regions (<figref idref="f0014 f0015">Figure 6</figref>). Several alternative strategies can be employed. The entire mouse Igλ locus can be replaced by the human locus by sequentially targeting a series of BACs that overlap across the human Igλ locus including the fully functional human Igλ 3' LCR into the mouse Igλ locus, sequentially replacing all of it, including the 3' LCRs. Alternatively, overlapping BACs can be engineered to contain all, or a portion of, the human Vλ genes and the 1-7 Jλ-Cλ pairs but with mouse Cλ genes replacing the human Cλ genes so that chimeric human Vλ-mouse Cλ Igλ chains are produced by the mouse. Alternatively, the human Igλ locus can be reconstructed on overlapping BACs to resemble the configuration of the human Igκ locus, with the complete set, or subset, of human Vλ genes, a cluster of 1-7 Jλ genes and a single selected human, or mouse, Cλ gene followed by the human 3' LCR. The inclusion of appropriate splice donor and splice acceptor sequences in the Jλ cluster and in the Cλ gene is confirmed, and if required, engineered into the BAC(s) in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> or during the chemical synthesis and assembly, prior to introduction into ES cells. This reconfigured locus rearranges and splices appropriately. However, it is possible that such a construct could rearrange more efficiently than in the germline configured human Igλ locus, therein leading to a proportionally higher representation of Igλ relative to Igκ in the light chain repertoire than is seen in humans.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">Other configurations of the human locus and introductions into the mouse Igλ locus so as to produce human Igλ V regions conjoined with either human or mouse Cλ genes can be readily designed and engineered. Either the human Igλ 3'LCR region with functional NFκB binding sites or the mouse Igλ 3'LCR control with introduced mutations, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis in vitro, to restore NFκB binding (see, e.g.,<nplcit id="ncit0014" npl-type="s"><text> Combriato and Klobeck, J. Immunol. 168:1259-1266</text></nplcit><u>),</u> or a functional sub-portion of either one, such as DNAse I hypersensitive site 3 of the human Igλ 3'LCR, is included downstream of the final Cλ gene in a cluster in all constructs. Alternatively, a functional Igλ 3'LCR<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> or functional sub-portion thereof from another species, e.g., rat, non-human primate, could be included. Alternatively, a functional Igκ 3' LCR from human, mouse or other species could be used.</p>
<p id="p0164" num="0164">Unless specifically deleted from or the sequence for which is not included in the chemically synthesized and assembled human DNA, the process of introducing the human Vλ repertoire will also introduce the genes for human surrogate light chain (SLC), which is within the human Vλ gene array in the germline DNA. Mouse SLC genes are linked to, but hundreds of kilobases separate from, the Igλ locus and would be unperturbed in this strategy so transgenic mice would co-express human and mouse SLC.</p>
<p id="p0165" num="0165">The human Vλ repertoire can be grouped into three clusters: A, B and C. The A cluster, most proximate to the J-C pairs, is the most frequently used, followed by the B and then the C cluster. One, two or three of these Vλ clusters may be incorporated. The strategy herein allows for engineering any or all or a portion thereof of the human Vλ clusters into the mouse genome, and replacing the endogenous mouse locus.</p>

<heading id="h0038">SELECTION OF NON-HUMAN MAMMALIAN CELLS FOLLOWING HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION</heading>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">To identify mammalian cells, such ES cells, that are the result of homologous recombination, a series of selection and screening procedures followed by molecular analyses are employed (<figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1</figref>, <figref idref="f0004 f0005">2</figref> and <figref idref="f0006 f0007">3</figref>). First, the cells are grown in the presence of a drug for which at least one drug-resistance gene is represented on the introduced BAC so as to select for cells that are stably carrying the BAC. The BAC may optionally carry a negative-selection marker such as thymidine kinase at the outside terminus of one or both of the flanking targeting regions to select against random integrants. Alternatively, clones positive for one drug resistance marker could be picked and duplicate plates made, one to test for drug resistance and one to test for drug sensitivity. Optionally, the BAC would also carry a screenable marker such as GFP or RFP<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> approximately adjacent to the selectable marker. GFP<sup>+</sup> or RFP<sup>+</sup> clones could be detected by FACS or fluorescence microscopy. Both positive selectable and screenable markers are internal to the flanking targeting DNA so as to be stably integrated into the genome along with the replacing DNA.</p>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">To confirm homologous recombination on selected (drug resistant) and, optionally, screened (e.g., GFP<sup>+</sup>) clones, genomic DNA is recovered from isolated clones and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis performed by a technique such as Southern blotting with a DNA probe from the endogenous loci, said probe mapping outside the replaced region. RFLP analysis shows allelic differences between the two alleles, the endogenous DNA and incoming DNA, when the homologous recombination occurs via introduction of a novel restriction site in the replacing DNA. Because flanking DNA arms &gt;10 kb in size may generate RFLPs that are large and difficult to resolve by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, low percentage agarose gels may be used or CHEF gel electrophoresis may be used. Flanking DNA arms of about 10 kb or less in size generate RFLPs that can be resolved by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, a restriction site may be purposely engineered into the replacing DNA on the BAC during replacement vector construction so as to engineer a conveniently sized fragment spanning the junction of the introduced DNA and the endogenous DNA upon restriction digest, and encompassing the designated probe sequence. In addition to RFLP analysis, cis integration may be screened using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the location of the introduced DNA according to methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">For subsequent engineering, different selectable and/or screenable markers are just internal to one flanking arm while the opposite flanking arm for homologous recombination, which overlaps with the flanking arm carrying the selectable and/or screenable markers used in targeting the BAC1, carries no markers, such that the homologous recombination event deletes the markers introduced in targeting BAC1 and introduces a new selectable and/or screenable marker at the opposite end (internal from the<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> opposite flanking arm). For example, fluorescent markers alternate between GFP and RFP after each round of homologous recombination occurs such that round 1 introduces GFP and round 2 deletes GFP and introduces RFP. If random insertion occurs, both fluorescent markers exist in the ES cells. A flow cytometer with cell sorting capability can be utilized to sort and retain cells based on the presence of signals from one fluorescent protein and the absence of signal from another. Drug resistance markers can be used similarly, e.g., using a pair of positive and negative selection markers (<figref idref="f0014">Fig 6A</figref> and <figref idref="f0015">6B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">Through standard advanced planning it should be possible to replace endogenous DNA with human DNA across megabase-sized loci through iterative rounds of homologous recombination using only 2 different pairs of combinations of one selectable marker and one screenable marker. However, three or more sets each of selectable and screenable markers could also be used.</p>
