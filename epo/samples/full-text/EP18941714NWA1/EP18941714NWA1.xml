<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the technical field of unmanned aerial vehicles and, more specifically, to a method and device for controlling a light emitting module, a movable platform, a light emitting system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and a computer-readable storage medium.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an unmanned aircraft operated by a radio remote control device and a self-provided program control device. UAVs are widely used, mainly divided into civilian use and military use. For civilian use, UAVs can undertake power inspections, especially with advantages over human in areas with difficult conditions, UAVs can also perform environmental monitoring, aerial photography of film and television dramas, mailing of small items, geographic mapping, and auxiliary post-disaster rescue, etc.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">During night flight, in order to indicate own position and movement direction, it is needed to install signal lights, that is, night flight lights that can facilitate mutual avoidance and identification. At present, as long as the UAV is flying at night, the night flight lights are always on. When using the UAV's imaging function, due to the high brightness of the night flight lights, the images captured by the UAV will generally be overexposed, which will affect the imaging capturing effect. Therefore, the use of night flight lights can seriously affect the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> imaging function of the UAV. However, if the night flight lights are turned off randomly, collision may occur during night flight with safety risks.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As such, conventional night flight lights of the UAV cannot be flexibly controlled, which can affect imaging quality or flight safety.</p>

It will be appreciated that the described embodiments represent some, rather than all, of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Other embodiments conceived or derived by those having ordinary skills in the art based on the described embodiments without inventive efforts should fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">It should be noted that, when one component is referred to as "fixed to" another component, it may be directly on another component or it is also possible that there is a third component between them. When one component is considered to "connect" another component, it may be directly connected to the other component or it is possible that there is a third component between them.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Unless otherwise defined, all the technical and scientific terms used in the present disclosure have the same or similar meanings as generally understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. As described in the present disclosure, the terms used in the specification of the present disclosure are intended to describe example embodiments, instead of limiting the present disclosure. The term "and/or" as used herein includes any and all combinations of one or more related listed items.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the case where there is no conflict between the exemplary embodiments, the features of the following embodiments and examples may be combined with each other.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of an implementation scenario according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the implementation scenario includes a remote controller 110 and movable platform 120. The remote controller 110 may be used to control the movable platform 120 in response to an operation instruction. The remote controller 110 may be connected to the movable platform 120 through a wired or wireless connection, and the movable platform 120 may be an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV for short), an unmanned vehicle, an unmanned ship, or the like.

The light emitting module 210 may be installed above and below the shell of a body 220 of the UAV 200, respectively, thereby playing a better role in avoidance and identification, and can be used as a night flight light. Based on the needs, the light emitting module 210 may also be used for<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> lighting. The remote controller 110 can be used to send a control instruction to the UAV 200 to control the flight state of the UAV 200. The UAV 200 may use the light emitting module 210 control method provided by the present disclosure to flexibly control the light emitting state of the light emitting module 210 on the drone.

The light emitting module may be installed on a movable platform. As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the method for controlling the light emitting module may include the following exemplary processes.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">410, determining a controlled state of the movable platform based on a received remote control signal.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The following description uses a UAV as an example of the movable platform. Unmanned vehicles and unmanned ships may refer to the implementation of the UAVs to control the light emitting state of the light emitting module. It should be noted that the remote control can be used to control the flight state of the UAV (including the flight speed, direction, etc.) and to control the UAV to perform imaging functions. The remote control signal may refer to a signal sent by the remote control to the UAV. In one embodiment, the remote control may send a remote control signal to the UAV at regular intervals. If the UAV detects that the remote control signal received regularly is interrupted or the reception is delayed, it can be considered that the UAV is out of control. In one embodiment, the interruption described above may be understood as the UAV not receiving the remote control signal within a predetermined period of time, or receiving an interrupted remote control signal. The reception delay described above may be that the difference between the time information carried in the received remote control signal and the realization information of the UAV itself exceeds the predetermined period of time, or the received remote control signal carries information with a delay mark, etc., which is not limited here. Conversely, if the UAV can regularly receive the remote control signal sent by the remote control, it can be considered that the UAV is in a controlled state.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The controlled state of the UAV may include an uncontrolled state and a controlled state. The uncontrolled state may refer to a disconnection of the remote control and the UAV, and the remote control cannot control the flight state of the UAV. Conversely, the controlled state may refer to a normal connection between the remote control and the UAV, and the remote control can control the flight state of the UAV.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">430, obtaining a light control instruction with a highest priority based on priorities of different signal sources configured corresponding to the controlled state, the signal source being used to initiate the light control instruction for controlling the light emitting module.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The signal source may include a camera module and a safety control module. It should be noted that the signal source is not limited to the listed modules, for example, it may also include a remote control module. The signal source may be considered as a computer program running in the UAV, or as an installed hardware module. It should be noted that the light emitting module may refer to a device with a light emitting function installed on the UAV. The light emitting module may include light emitting devices, such as LED lights and lasers. The signal source may initiate a light control instruction to control the light emitting module, and the light control instruction may be used to control the light switch state, light brightness, and blinking frequency. The blinking frequency may refer to the number of light or dark when the light and dark alternately change within a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The camera module may initiate a light control instruction to control the light emitting module to turn off the light when receiving an imaging instruction sent by the remote control. At the end of imaging, a light control instruction to control the light emitting module to restore the state before it was turned off may be initiated.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">The safety control module may initial a light control instruction to control the light emitting module when it detects that the UAV is out of control. The light control instruction may instruct to turn on the light of the light emitting module, set the brightness to 100 nits, and increase the blinking frequency (e.g., 5 Hz). The specific brightness and blinking frequency values can be adjusted based on actual needs.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The remote control module may also be referred to as an APP (application) module. The remote control module may send a light control remote instruction to the remote control module based on the light remote control operation performed by the user. The remote control module may initiate a light control instruction to control the light emitting module based on the light remote control operation indicated by the light remote control instruction. The light remote control operation may include the operation of activating, deactivating, and setting the brightness and blinking frequency. Correspondingly, the light control instruction may indicate the light switch state, brightness, and blinking frequency. It should be noted that when the UAV is out of control and the connection between the remote control and the UAV is interrupted, the remote control module cannot obtain the light remote control instruction, nor will it initiate the light control instruction.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">More specifically, when the UAV is in a controlled state, it may be considered that the probability of UAV collision is low at this time, such that the priority of the camera module can be configured to be the highest. That is, the light control instruction initiated by the camera module may have the highest priority, that is, the camera module may have the highest control authority. Therefore, when the UAV is in a controlled state, the light control instruction of the camera control module with the highest priority may be obtained. Therefore, even if the camera module initiates a light control instruction to instruction to turn off the light or reduce the brightness of the light when capturing images, the light of the light emitting module may be turned off, which will not affect the safety of the UAV flight, and it can also avoid the influence of the light of the light emitting module on the imaging effect.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">When the UAV is in the uncontrolled state, it can be considered that the probability of UAV collision is relatively high at this time, therefore, the priority of the safety<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> control module may be configured to be the highest. That is, the light control instruction initiated by the safety control module may have the highest priority, that is, the safety module may have the highest control authority. Therefore, when the UAV is in the uncontrolled state, the light control instruction of the safety control module with the highest priority may be obtained. The light control instruction initiated by the safety control module may include, for example, instructions to turn on the light, set the brightness to 100 nits, and increase the blinking frequency, etc. In one embodiment, in the uncontrolled state, the light emitting module of the UAV may constantly be in a light-on state, and using faster blinking frequency and brighter brightness to remind the surroundings that the UAV is out of control to avoid collisions with the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">450, controlling the light emitting state of the light emitting module by executing the light control instruction with the highest priority.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In some embodiments, the lighting state may include the switch state, and may also include the brightness and/or blinking frequency. The execution of the light control instruction can be sending the light control instruction to the light emitting module, and the light emitting module's own hardware circuit may control the light-on state, brightness, and/or blinking frequency. For example, when the UAV is in the uncontrolled state, the light control instruction initiated by the safety control module with the highest priority may be executed to control the light emitting module to be in the on state, with a brightness of 100 nits, and a blinking frequency of 5 Hz. It should be noted that the activating state and light-on state described in the present disclosure all mean that the light of the light emitting module is on.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">More specifically, when the UAV is in the controlled state, it may execute the light control instruction with the highest priority initiated by the camera module. If the camera<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> module receives an imaging instruction and needs to capture an image, the light control instruction initiated by the camera module may instruct to turn off the light and control the light of the light emitting module to turn off. If the image capturing is complete and the camera module receives an imaging ending instruction, the initiated light control instruction may instruct to restore the light, that is control the light emitting module to restore the switch state, light brightness, and blinking frequency before the light is turned off.</p>
