<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure is generally related to a reference cassette for a fluorescence type immunoassay diagnostic apparatus. More specifically, the present disclosure is related to a reference cassette for a fluorescence type immunoassay diagnostic apparatus in which, by arranging fluorescence glass, which does not change in characteristics and is capable of constantly maintaining fluorescence characteristics, inside a case, in a process of testing measurement accuracy regarding fluorescence detection of the immunoassay diagnostic apparatus, reference measurement information regarding the fluorescence detection can be precisely provided and therefore the accuracy of the test can be improved, because the change in characteristics and heat deterioration of the fluorescence glass do not occur, the measurement accuracy may not be lowered even it is continuously used and it can be used semi-permanently, and by having a mask at which slits limiting an outside exposure area of the fluorescence glass to a specific area are formed, the fluorescence having the same shape as the reaction area of the actually used specimen strip can be generated.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, a test method used in disease diagnosis is based on color development, fluorescence and so on by enzyme reaction, but recently immunoassay using immunization reaction between an antigen and an antibody is also being used. Such immunoassay methods mainly label antibodies with radioisotopes or fluorescent substances to identify the presence or absence of antigens, and label type biosensors are used to quantify the intensity of radiation or fluorescence.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventional immunoassay methods have used a method of measuring a signal obtained by labeling antigens or antibodies with radioactive substances, luminescent substances or fluorescent substances, and optical measurement methods such as Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) combining photolabels with catalytic reactions of enzymes and Western blotting. Those methods have disadvantages in that complex procedures that can be performed primarily by laboratory-based skilled researchers are required, the devices for analysis are expensive and largescale devices, and long analysis time is needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Because antibodies, which are the target substance of an immune sensor, are present in very low concentrations in biological samples such as whole blood, serum, urine and so on, the immune sensor requires to have a signaling technology which is much more highly sensitive than the biosensor technology of detecting other substances in terms of detection limit of the sensor. In addition, since the structure of protein such as antibodies or protein antigens are easily altered by changes in the external environment, the recognition portion of the antigen or antibody is deteriorated, and thus unique biometric recognition function is easily lost. Because the immune sensor requires to perform analysis in the solid form, the production of a sensor surface suitable for the biopsy materials that can maintain the activation of the biopsy materials, the immobilization technology of the biopsy materials which can increase the detection limit, and the measurement method transforming biometric recognition reaction to quantified signals are needed.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Rapid diagnostic test kits for immunoassay are test instruments for point-of-care that is capable of performing diagnostic test using biopsy specimens such as blood, urine, and saliva. Examples of such rapid diagnostic test kits include pregnancy diagnosis kits, AIDS diagnosis kits, and so on.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Those diagnostic devices require to establish a method capable of detecting biomaterial (protein or DNA, etc.) for diagnosis. A fluorescent labeling method using an organic dye or the like has been known as a conventional method for detecting the biomaterial. The fluorescent label emits various colors depending on types to provide a detection means for a target biomaterial.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The immunoassay diagnostic devices use a specimen strip capable of absorbing and supplying biopsy specimen through capillary phenomenon, and a plurality of reaction areas are formed at the specimen strip by applying different reaction material to each of the reaction areas. In the plurality of reaction regions, each reactive substance is combined with a biopsy specimen having a specific disease to form a fluorescent reaction complex, and the fluorescent reaction complex generates fluorescence when light is applied. Accordingly, after inserting the specimen strip into the device, the test light is applied to the specimen strip from a light source, and fluorescence generated from the reaction region of the specimen strip is detected by an optical system, thereby diagnosing a specific disease associated with the biopsy specimen.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">As those types of the immunoassay diagnostic devices are used for a long time, the measurement accuracy may be deteriorated due to an abnormality in the optical system or other control unit, and a measurement error may occur because of the change in the characteristics of the reaction material applied to the specimen strip. Therefore, it is necessary for the immunoassay<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> diagnosis devices using a fluorescent type specimen strip to periodically check whether the measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnosis device is accurate.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to test the measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnostic device, a separate reference cassette is used, and the reference cassette is manufactured in a state that a test strip is accommodated therein and a fluorescent substance in an unmodified standard state is applied to the test strip. The reference cassette is inserted into the device to apply test light, and fluorescence generated from the fluorescent material of the test strip is detected to check whether a measurement error occurs in the device. That is, if the detection amount of the fluorescence detected by inserting the reference cassette into the device is different from a predetermined standard detection amount, an error occurs in the device, and an error occurrence alarm sign may be output through a display unit of the device.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the reference cassette for testing the measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnostic device requires to be manufactured very precisely, and the fluorescent material applied to the test strip of the reference cassette also needs to be maintained constantly in a standard state in which the characteristics are not changed. However, the fluorescent substance is easily denatured by the external environment due to its characteristics and therefore it is difficult to maintain the characteristics of the standard state, and in this case, the reference cassette cannot perform normal function as the reference cassette for testing the measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnostic device.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, in order to precisely check the measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnostic device, stably maintaining the standard state of the reference cassette is highly important, and recently the demand and necessity thereof are increasing.</p>

<p id="p0030" num="0030">A reference cassette for a fluorescence type immunoassay diagnostic apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may be for being inserted into an immunoassay diagnostic apparatus in order to test measurement accuracy of the immunoassay diagnostic apparatus diagnosing a disease from a biopsy specimen using fluorescence and generating fluorescence by a test light of an optical module, may comprise a case (100), and a fluorescence glass (200), and may further include a mask (300) and a fixing guide (400).</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The case (100) is configured to be insertable into the immunoassay diagnostic apparatus, and is formed to have an accommodating space to accommodating components such as the fluorescence glass (200) and so on. An opening unit (102) is formed at a partial area of an upper surface of the case (100) so that an inner space of the case (100) can be exposed, and the opening unit (102) can be protected by a separate transparent cover.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The case (100) may be formed to have an accommodating space therein, and include an upper case (120) and a lower case (110) which are separately formed and can be formed to have a structure coupled to each other. The lower case (110) forms a base of the case (100) and components are coupled to an inner side surface of the lower case (110), and in this state, the upper case (120) is coupled to an upside of the lower case (110). The opening unit (102) is formed at a center portion of an upper surface of the upper case (120), and a body fluid injection hole (101) is formed at one side of the upper surface of the upper case (120) so that body fluid specimen can be absorbably injected into the body fluid injection hole (101). The reference cassette may not need the body fluid injection hole (101), but the body fluid injection hole (101) may be included in the reference cassette to have an identical structure to an actual cassette.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">A single sheet or a plurality of sheets of fluorescence glass (200) may be disposed in the inner space of the case (100) to be exposed to the outside of the case (100) through the opening unit<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (102) of the case (100). The fluorescence glass (200) may be made of lanthanide series material, and be configured to generate fluorescence by the test light of the optical module and constantly maintain fluorescence characteristics. Europium, terbium and so on can be used as the lanthanide series material.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Because the fluorescence characteristics of the fluorescence glass (200) is constantly maintained, the change does not occur in the characteristics, and therefore, in the process of testing measurement accuracy regarding fluorescence detection of the immunoassay diagnostic apparatus, the accuracy of the test may be improved.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The reference cassette comprising the fluorescence glass (200) does not have the change in the characteristics of the fluorescence glass (200) or heat deterioration and therefore the measurement accuracy may not be lowered even it is continuously used and there is advantage that it can be used semi-permanently.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">If an extensive area of the fluorescence glass (200) is exposed to the outside of the case (100) through the opening unit (102) of the case (100), the fluorescence detection at a specific area by the optical module may not be easy and be inaccurate, and therefore a separate mask (300) that can limit an outside exposure area of the fluorescence glass (200) to a specific area may be installed.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The mask (300) is arranged at the inside of the case (100) to be located on an upper surface of the fluorescence glass (200). A plurality of slits (310) are formed at the mask (300), and the fluorescence glass (200) is configured to be exposed to the outside of the case (100) through the slits (310) of the mask (300).</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Generally, in the immunoassay diagnostic apparatus, the reaction area of a specimen strip to which fluorescence is applied is formed in a line shape crossing the specimen strip, the slit (310) may be lengthily formed to extend in one direction and have a shape similar to the reaction area of the specimen strip, and the fluorescence glass (200) is outwardly exposed through the slit (310) with the line shape.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In this case, the test light of the optical module is applied to the fluorescence glass (200) through the slip (310), and the fluorescence generated from the fluorescence glass (200) by the application of the lest light is configured to be emitted to the optical module through the slit (310).</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">The mask (300) is made of material which is capable of blocking the light, and is formed in a shape of a thin plate having thin thickness to minimize shadow generated when the test light and the fluorescence pass through the slit (310). In this example, the material with high stiffness, for example, metal material can be used to reinforce flexural strength of the mask (300). Additionally, it is preferred that the mask (300) is arranged to contact the upper surface of the fluorescence glass<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> (200) in order to minimize the shadow generated due to the thickness of the slit (310) of the mask (300).</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">And, a fixing guide (400) having a plurality of insertion coupling holes (410) is coupled in the inside of the case (100). The fixing guide (400) may be formed in a shape of flat plate. The fluorescence glass (200) may be implemented in multiple pieces, each of pieces of the fluorescence glass (200) is insertedly coupled to a respective insertion coupling hole (410) of the fixing guide (400), and the mask (300) is coupled to the fixing guide (400) such that each slit (310) can limit an outside exposure area of each piece of the fluorescence glass (200) to a slit (310) area.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the fixing guide (400) is safely coupled inside the case (100) to a bottom surface of the lower case (110), the fluorescence glass (200) is insertedly coupled to each of the insertion holes (410) of the fixing guide (400), and in this state, the mask (300) is coupled to the upper side of the fixing guide (400). The mask (300) is positioned so that each of the plurality of the slits (310) can be located on the upper side of the fluorescence glass (200) and the outside exposure area of outside exposure area is limited to the slit (310) area.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">One or more guide protrusions (420) are formed at the fixing guide (400) to guide a position which is coupled with the mask (300), and one or more guide holes (320) are formed at the mask (300) to be insertedly coupled with the guide protrusions (420). Therefore, the position of the mask (300) is guided by coupling the guide protrusion (420) and the guide hole (320) to each other so that the mask (300) can be fixed to a precise location, and the slit (310) of the mask (300) is positioned on the upper side of the fluorescence glass (200) and therefore the outside exposure area of the fluorescence glass (200) can be located at the accurate and proper location.</p>

<p id="p0045" num="0045">Like this, the mask (300) with the thin plate shape is arranged to be contacted with the upper surface of the fluorescence glass (200), and therefore the shadow caused by the thickness of the slit (310) can be minimized, the problem of lowering the detection amount of the light by the shadow may be minimized, and the accuracy can be improved.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Additionally, a horizontal guide hole (432) and a vertical guide hole (431) may be formed at one end portion of the fixing guide (400) to guide the safe coupling location of the fixing guide (400) with respect to the case (100), and a horizontal guide protrusion (112) and a vertical guide<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> protrusion (111) are protrudingly formed on the bottom surface of the case (100) to be insertedly interlocked with the horizontal guide hole (432) and the vertical guide hole (431), respectively.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Like this, because the position of the fixing guide (400) also can be guided, the fixing guide (400) can be securely fixed to an accurate location inside the case (100), and the fluorescence glass (200) and the mask (300) coupled with the fixing guide (400) can be fixed to a precise location as well.</p>
