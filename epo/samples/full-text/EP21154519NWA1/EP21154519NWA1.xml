<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">For an environmental power generation technology by which electricity generated from minute energy such as solar energy, vibration energy, and body temperatures of human and animal is stored and utilized for a sensor, wireless transmission power, and the like, secondary batteries that are safe and highly reliable in any environment on the globe are demanded.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Among secondary batteries, an all-solid-state battery in which all elemental materials are made into a solid state has been attracting attention because there is no possibility of liquid leakage, ignition, or the like. Usually, in the all-solid-state battery, compared to a second battery using a liquid electrolyte, an internal resistance value of the battery is likely to increase and a large current is difficult to extract.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, causes of the increase in the internal resistance value of a bulk-type all-solid-state battery include (1) resistance at a contact interface between particles of a solid electrolyte (grain-boundary resistance), (2) an interface between an electrode material and the solid electrolyte (electrode interface resistance), (3) resistance in the particles of the solid electrolyte (bulk resistance), and the like.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">To reduce these internal resistance values of the bulk-type all-solid-state battery, for example, a method of producing an all-solid-state battery has been proposed. This method includes laminating a positive electrode sheet having powder of a solid electrolyte and a positive electrode active material, an electrolyte sheet having powder of the solid electrolyte, and a negative electrode sheet having powder of the solid electrolyte and a negative electrode active material and firing the laminate at a temperature higher than or equal to a sintering temperature of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the solid electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, to improve the above-described (3) resistance in the particles of the solid electrolyte (bulk resistance), it has been proposed to use a glass material having predetermined characteristics as a solid electrolyte.</p>

<heading id="h0005">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In a dedicated study made by the inventors, when heat treatment was performed to crystallize a solid electrolyte in the manufacture of a bulk-type all-solid-state battery, there was a problem in that, in some cases, an electrode material was decomposed or solid-solved with the solid electrolyte at an interface with the solid electrolyte, and desired performance was not obtained.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">For example, the inventors have found through the study that, in some cases, when heat treatment was performed at a temperature higher than or equal to a crystallization temperature Tc of the solid electrolyte to improve the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte, the electrode material was decomposed or solid-solved with the solid electrolyte, and the internal resistance was unable to be decreased.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present disclosure, decomposition of an electrode material means that an electrode material is decomposed into a plurality of ingredients. Solid solution of an electrode material with a solid electrolyte means a state in which the electrode material is mixed with the solid electrolyte in a solid state.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The electrode material is not particularly limited as long as the electrode material is, for example, a material used for a positive electrode and a negative electrode used for an all-solid-state battery of related art and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">For the present disclosure, when the composition of a solid electrolyte was optimized by an Ising model equation by using a digital annealer that is an Ising machine of a simulated annealing method, a composition containing Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> was found, and the disclosed technique has been completed.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Based on the obtained findings, the following verification experiment was performed to study a crystalline solid electrolyte actually containing Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, and Li<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p id="p0020" num="0020">Regarding crystallization performed to improve the ion conductivity of a solid electrolyte, the crystallization temperature Tc and the X-ray diffraction of the solid electrolyte containing Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, and Li<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> were measured.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">First, specimens #1 to #15 in which Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, and Li<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> (each made by Toshima Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) were weighed in molar ratio so as to have composition ratios (mole%, content) presented in Table 1 below and a ternary diagram in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> were mixed under the following ball mill conditions.</p>

<p id="p0027" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, it has been measured that specimens #1 to #15 each have the crystallization temperature in the measurement temperature range of 25°C to 1,000°C. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, it has been confirmed that the specimens #1 to #15 each have a peak due to the X-ray diffraction and have a crystal structure. In <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the left end indicates 3°.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Next, the specimen (crystalline solid electrolyte) #5 after mixing by using a ball mill similar to that described above was heated to a Tg glass transition point (490°C) existing before the first crystallization temperature of the specimen #5 and maintained for one hour. After that, annealing treatment for maintaining at the temperature of 640°C for one hour was performed. Then, natural cooling to room temperature was performed, and the obtained specimen was subjected to X-ray diffraction measurement under the following conditions. The integrated intensities at a true crystal peak (crystalline portion) and an amorphous peak (amorphous portion) obtained from the measurement were calculated by using X-ray analysis software PDXL2 (made by Rigaku Corporation). The degree of crystallinity was calculated from the calculated integrated intensities. The results are presented in Table 2 and <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">As a control experiment, the degree of crystallinity of the specimen (crystalline solid electrolyte) #5 after mixing by using a ball mill similar to that used for the above-described vitrification was similarly measured without the heat treatment.

<p id="p0034" num="0034">Next, to examine the ion conductivity, the conductivity was measured by using powders (crystalline solid electrolytes) of specimens #1 to #15 after differential calorimetry.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">First, each of powders specimens #1 to #15 that weighs 0.5 g was pressed by a uniaxial molding machine so as to be molded into a pellet having a thickness of 0.4 mm and a diameter of 10 mm. The molded pellets were heated while being<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> subjected to a dry argon flow and held in a range from 700 to 1,000°C for 12 hours. After being held in the heated state, the pellets were naturally cooled to room temperature to prepare conductivity measurement pellets #1 to #15. Au was evaporated, to a thickness of 240 nm, onto both surfaces of each of the prepared conductivity measurement pellets #1 to #15, and an amperometric response was measured by applying 1 to 50 mV in a range of 1 MHz to 100 Hz by an alternating current (AC) impedance method. The measurement atmosphere in the AC impedance method was a dry argon flow at room temperature of 23°C and 300°C. As an evaluation device, a frequency response analyzer incorporated in a VMP-300 multichannel electrochemical measurement system made by Bio-Logic Science Instruments is used. The measurement results are presented in Table 3 and <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>.

A photograph of specimen #5 having been subjected to the reducing property evaluation is illustrated in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 8B</figref>.

The degree of discoloration (%) in specimen #5 obtained by the following expression was 7%: degree of discoloration (%) = {(average<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> value of signal intensities of Li metal plate before contact with specimen (region other than contact portion) - average value of signal intensities of Li metal plate after contact with specimen (region of contact portion))/(average value of signal intensities of Li metal plate before contact with specimen (region other than contact portion)} × 100.</p>
