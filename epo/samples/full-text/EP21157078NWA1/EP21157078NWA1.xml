<heading id="h0004"><u>Detailed Description</u></heading>
<p id="p0158" num="0158">Referring to the drawings and initially to <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1 to 16</figref> thereof there is illustrated a valve 1 which can open automatically in one direction.</p>
<p id="p0159" num="0159">The valve 1 comprises a polymeric valve body having a proximal outer support region with a rim 2, at least three valve leaflets 3, 4, 5, and a main body region 6 extending between the support rim 2 and the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5. The valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 extend inwardly and distally and<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> terminate at distal end faces 7, 8, 9 respectively. The leaflets each 3, 4, 5 have legs a, b which extend at an included angle of 120° to each other. The adjacent pairs of legs 3a; 4a; 4b; 5b; 5a; 3b; co - apt to close the gap between the valve leaflets when the valve is in the normally closed configuration.</p>
<p id="p0160" num="0160">The valve 1 has two configurations. The first configuration is a normally closed configuration in which the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 co-apt to close the valve. The second configuration is an open configuration in which the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 are opened such that the leaflet leg pairs 3a; 4a; 4b; 5b; 5a; 3b are opened and spaced-apart in response to a force F1 to allow flow through the valve.</p>
<p id="p0161" num="0161">The various configurations of the valve 1 are illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Figs. 11 to 16</figref>. In the first or normally closed configuration (<figref idref="f0004">Figs 11, 14</figref>) the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 co-apt. When a force F1 is applied to the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 the leaflet legs pairs 3a; 4a; 4b; 5b; and 5a; 3b open to allow antegrade flow to pass (<figref idref="f0004">Figs. 12, 16). Fig. 15</figref> illustrates a partially open configuration in response to flow. When the force F1 is removed the leaflets 3, 4, 5 return to the closed position under the inherent biasing of the polymeric material of the valve body (<figref idref="f0004">Fig. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">The valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 are reinforced in the region of co - aption. In this case, this is achieved by a local thickening of the polymeric material in this region. Similarly the support rim 2 is reinforced by a local thickening of the polymeric material.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">The region of co-aption of the valve leaflets 3, 4, 5 has an axial extent which is typically from 1 to 5mm. This ensures positive co-aption of the leaflets across a significant interfacial area when the valve is in the normally closed configuration. The thickness of the leaflets at the region of co-aption is typically between 0.1mm and 10mm.</p>
<p id="p0164" num="0164">The valve body has a generally concave outer face and a generally convex inner face.</p>
<p id="p0165" num="0165">The valve 1 of the invention returns to its original working position after being fully opened. This is accomplished without damaging the working valve.</p>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">When the valve is opened by stomach emptying the leaflets open.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">One important characteristic influencing the functioning of the valve is the leaflet legs that impinge on one another. By varying the geometry and length of the leaflets 3, 4, 5 the valve 1 can be made to open at different pressures. Opening is also dependant on the elasticity and density of the material the device is made from. Additionally, the overall diameter and the diameter to which the leaflets open influence the opening force.</p>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">The valve may be of any suitable biocompatible polymeric material. It may be of a biocompatible polymeric material having properties which allow the valve to function as described.</p>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">The materials used for the production of this valve have a % elongation between 50% and 3000%. The material also has a tensile strength of between 0.01 and 5 MPa. Addionally the material could have an antimicrobial action to prevent colonisation when in-vivo. Additionally the material can be elastic or viscoelastic and can optionally be an open cell foam. The density of the material should be between 0.1 g/cm3 to 1.5 g/cm3.</p>
<p id="p0170" num="0170">The valve of the invention may be mounted to any suitable luminal prosthesis, especially a prosthesis or stent. The rim 2 of the valve provides a mounting ring for mounting within the stent 20, for example, the valve 1 may be mounted to the stent by suturing the rim 2 to the stent mesh using sutures 21 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0005">Figs. 18 and 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0171" num="0171">The stent may be of any suitable type. An uncoated or unsleeved stent 20 is illustrated in <figref idref="f0005">Figs. 17 to 19</figref>. Alternatively, if it is desired to prevent tissue ingrowth a stent 30 having a sleeve 31 may be used (<figref idref="f0006 f0007">Figs. 20 to 23</figref>). In this case the sleeve 31 is external of the stent. In other cases there may alternatively or additionally be an internal sleeve. Further, the stent may have a coating.</p>
<p id="p0172" num="0172">A valve such as described above may also be placed into a pre-deployed luminal prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">In one case a valve 100 may have a co-axial support structure or scaffold 102 is shown in <figref idref="f0008">Figs. 24 and 25</figref>. The scaffold 102 is designed to engage with any suitable esophageal stent 140 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0009">Fig. 29</figref>. The mechanism of engagement can be by protrusions which may for example be proximal and/or distal apices 103 of the scaffold 102 which engage into the mesh of the existing pre-deployed stent 140. Alternatively or additionally, the scaffold 102 may have<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> features 150 designed to hook onto the inside of the struts of an esophageal stent as illustrated in <figref idref="f0009">Figs. 31 and 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">Referring to <figref idref="f0008">Figs. 26 and 27</figref> there is illustrated a valve 110 according to another embodiment of the invention in which the support structure or scaffold 102 tapers distally outwardly so that distal apices 111 of the scaffold engage with the mesh of the existing pre-deployed host stent 140.</p>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">Referring to <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 28</figref> there is illustrated another valve 120 according to the invention in which the support structure or scaffold 102 tapers distally inward so that proximal apices 121 of the scaffold 102 engage with the mesh of an existing pre-deployed stent 140.</p>
<p id="p0176" num="0176">The radial force of the scaffold 102 may exert enough friction to hold the valve in place without the necessity for protrusion. In another embodiment a surgical adhesive may be used to secure the retrofitted valve into place.</p>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">Referring to <figref idref="f0010">Figs. 33 to 37</figref> a valve 100 is loaded into a delivery system 130 for deployment. The outer diameter of the delivery system 130 is smaller than the inner diameter of a pre-deployed esophageal stent 140. The delivery system 130 in this case comprises a delivery catheter having a distal pod 131 in which a valve is housed in a contracted configuration. The catheter has a tapered distal tip 132 to avoid snagging on a pre-deployed stent 140. The pod 131 is axially movable relative to the tip 132 to release the valve from the pod 131.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">The delivery system 130 is used to deliver the valve to a pre-deployed stent 140 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0011">Fig. 38</figref>. The stent 140 has a mesh and the scaffold of the valve is adapted to engage with the mesh of the pre-deployed stent 140 on release of the valve from the delivery catheter as illustrated particularly in <figref idref="f0011">Figs. 39 and 40</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0179" num="0179">Referring to <figref idref="f0009">Figs. 29 to 32</figref> there is illustrated an idealised stent 140 with a valve support scaffold 102 in situ. Details of a valve are omitted from these drawings for clarity. In this case the scaffold 102 is located at the upper proximal end of the stent. In this case the scaffold 102 has hook-like members 150 for engagement with the mesh of the stent 140 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0009">Figs 31 and 32</figref>. The interengagement between the stent 140 and the scaffold 102 ensures that the scaffold<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> 102 and hence the valve which is fixed to it is retained in position and provides an anti-proximal migration mechanism.</p>
<p id="p0180" num="0180">In the cases illustrated the valve supporting scaffold 102 is of a self expanding material such as a shape memory material, for example Nitinol. The valve and scaffold are loaded into the delivery catheter pod 131 in a compressed / reduced diameter configuration. When the constraint of the pod 131 is removed at the deployment site, the scaffold and valve self expand to the normal configuration in which the scaffold is engaged with the pre-deployed host stent 140. In some arrangements the scaffold may be of an expensile material which is expanded by an expander such as a balloon or the like.</p>
<p id="p0181" num="0181">Referring to <figref idref="f0012 f0013">Figs. 41 to 44</figref> there is illustrated another valve device 151 according to the invention which is similar to that described above and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals. In this case the valve 1 is housed within a support structure or scaffold 102 and is placed into the lumen of a stent 140 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0014">Figs. 45 to 47</figref>. The support structure may comprise a relatively short length (typically 40mm) of a mesh made from a shape memory material such as Nitinol. The mesh may be formed by laser cutting and / or may be of woven construction. Deployment into the lumen of the host stent 140 is via self expansion from a radially collapsed state within a delivery catheter 130 as shown in <figref idref="f0013">Figs. 43 and 44</figref>. The device 151 is held in place within the stent 140 by means of specific interaction mechanisms that increase the axial friction of the support structure 102. <figref idref="f0014">Figs. 45 to 47</figref> illustrate the interaction with the host stent 140. In this embodiment the support structure 102 has a series of loops or protrusions 155 extending perpendicularly from its surface. These protrusions 155 engage with the structure of any host stent 140 by interlocking with the existing mesh as shown in <figref idref="f0016">Figs. 52 and 53</figref>. The apical tip of each protrusion 155 is in this case rounded or designed so as to be non-traumatic to any tissue that may come into contact with the protrusion 155. The intrinsic radial force of the support structure 102 as well as the flexural strength of the protrusions 155 interact to effect the retention performance of the support structure 102. Thus the stiffness or flexural strength of the protrusion 155 and the radial force of the support structure 102 may be modified to change the interlocking capability and retention performance of the device.</p>
<p id="p0182" num="0182">The valve device 151 is also readily radially collapsible by distal and proximal drawstrings 170, 171. The distal drawstring 170 passes through eyelets 172 mounted to the support structure 102 at the distal end of the valve device 151. The distal drawstring 170 has an accessible pull string<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> 173 which, on pulling, pulls the drawstring 171 inwardly and thus reduces the diameter of the distal end of the support structure 102. Similarly the proximal drawstring 171 passes through eyelets 175 mounted the support structure 102 at the proximal end of valve device 151. The proximal drawstring 171 has an accessible pull string 177 which, on pulling, pulls the drawstring 171 inwardly and thus reduces the diameter of the proximal end of the support structure 102. The pull strings 173, 177 can be readily gripped using a suitable instrument such as a grasper to draw the proximal and distal ends of the support structure 102 inwardly for ease of removal of the valve device 151.</p>
<p id="p0183" num="0183">Referring to <figref idref="f0015 f0016 f0017">Figs. 48 to 57</figref> there is illustrated another valve device 200 according to the invention which is similar to that described above and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals. In this case the valve 1 is housed within a support structure or scaffold 102 and is placed into the lumen of a stent 140 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0016 f0017">Figs. 53 to 56</figref>. The support structure 102 may comprise a relatively short length (typically 40mm) of a mesh made from a shape memory material such as Nitinol. The mesh may be formed by laser cutting and / or may be of woven construction. Deployment into the lumen of the host stent 140 is via self expansion from a radially collapsed state within a delivery catheter 130 as shown in <figref idref="f0016">Figs. 50 to 55</figref>. The device 200 is held in place within the stent 140 by means of specific interaction mechanisms that increase the axial friction of the support structure 102. <figref idref="f0017">Fig. 56</figref> illustrates the interaction with the host stent 140. In this embodiment the support structure 102 has a series of loops or protrusions 155 extending perpendicularly from its surface.

Thus the stiffness or flexural strength of the protrusion 155 and the radial force of the support structure 102 may be modified to change the interlocking capability and retention performance of the device.</p>
<p id="p0184" num="0184">The valve device 200 is also readily radially collapsible by distal and proximal drawstrings 170, 171. The distal drawstring 170 passes through eyelets 172 mounted to the support structure 102 at the distal end of the valve device 200. The distal drawstring 170 has an accessible pull string 173 which, on pulling, pulls the drawstring 171 inwardly and thus reduces the diameter of the distal end of the support structure 102. Similarly the proximal drawstring 171 passes through<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> eyelets 175 mounted the support structure 102 at the proximal end of valve device 200. The proximal drawstring 171 has an accessible pull string 177 which, on pulling, pulls the drawstring 171 inwardly and thus reduces the diameter of the proximal end of the support structure 102. The pull strings 173, 177 can be readily gripped using a suitable instrument such as a grasper to draw the proximal and distal ends of the support structure 102 inwardly for ease of removal of the valve device 200.</p>
<p id="p0185" num="0185">It will be noted that in the case of this device 200 the diameter of the support scaffold is relatively uniform and the proximal and distal ends 201, 202 of the device 200 are not tapered. We have found that the interengagement of the rounded protrusions 155 in interstices defined in the mesh structure of the stent 140 is sufficient to retain the device 200 in position in the stent 140. Typically, the diameter of the expanded support structure 102 will be slightly larger, for example 1 to 5% larger than that of the host stent 140 at the desired deployment location to assist in maintaining the scaffold 102 in situ.</p>
<p id="p0186" num="0186">In some cases, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0017">Fig. 57</figref> the devices of the invention such as the device 200 may be a radially collapsed state if it is described to re-position the valve device 200 with the stent 140 or to withdraw the device 200, for example for replacement and/or for replacement of the host stent 140.</p>
<p id="p0187" num="0187">Thus, the collapsibility of the valves enables its optional removal by disengagement of the protrusions 155 from the host stent 140, thus eliminating any axial friction associated with the host stent 140.</p>

<p id="p0189" num="0189">The valve may have any desired number of leaflets, for example the valve 300 illustrated in <figref idref="f0018 f0019 f0020">Figs. 58 to 65</figref> has six valve leaflets 333. These leaflets 333 are oriented perpendicular to direction of food flow to additionally allow greater distensibility of the valve aperture.</p>

The valve leaflets 303 extend inwardly and distally and terminate at distal end faces 303 respectively. The leaflets each 303 have legs which extend at an included angle of 60° to each other.

<p id="p0194" num="0194">The valve leaflets 303 are reinforced in the region of co - aption. In this case, this is achieved by a local thickening of the polymeric material in this region. Similarly the support rim 302 is reinforced by a local thickening of the polymeric material.</p>
<p id="p0195" num="0195">The region of co-aption of the valve leaflets 303 has an axial extent which is typically from 1 to 5mm. This ensures positive co-aption of the leaflets across a significant interfacial area when the valve is in the normally closed configuration. The thickness of the leaflets at the region of co-aption is typically between 0.1mm and 10mm.</p>
<p id="p0196" num="0196">The valve body 306 has a generally concave outer face and a generally convex inner face.</p>
<p id="p0197" num="0197">The valve 300 of the invention returns to its original working position after being fully opened. This is accomplished without damaging the working valve.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --></p>
<p id="p0198" num="0198">An important characteristic influencing the functioning of the valve 300 is the leaflet legs that impinge on one another. By varying the geometry and length of the leaflets 303 the valve 300 can be made to open at different pressures. Opening is also dependant on the elasticity and density of the material the device is made from. Additionally, the overall diameter and the diameter to which the leaflets open influence the opening force.</p>
<p id="p0199" num="0199">The valve may be of any suitable biocompatible polymeric material. It may be of a biocompatible polymeric material having properties which allow the valve to function as described.</p>
<p id="p0200" num="0200">The materials used for the production of this valve have a % elongation between 50% and 3000%. The material also has a tensile strength of between 0.01 and 5 MPa. Addionally the material could have an antimicrobial action to prevent colonisation when in-vivo. Additionally the material can be elastic or viscoelastic and can optionally be an open cell foam. The density of the material should be between 0.1 g/cm3 to 1.5 g/cm3.</p>
<p id="p0201" num="0201">The valve 300 of the invention may be mounted to any suitable luminal prosthesis. The rim 302 of the valve provides a mounting ring for mounting within the prosthesis, for example, the valve 300 may be mounted to the stent by suturing the rim 2 to the stent mesh using sutures.</p>
<p id="p0202" num="0202">Many emerging obesity treatments involve the placement of a tube into the duodenum, which restricts the absorption of certain nutrients at this point in the body. The resulting calorific deficit then results in weight loss. Some of these devices can cause the pyloric valve to be opened for prolonged periods thus causing rapid stomach emptying. During episodes of rapid stomach emptying the feeling of fullness is shortened and thus the patient eats more.</p>
<p id="p0203" num="0203">We have found that by placing a valve device at or near the pylorus that can controllably restrict the rate of stomach emptying then a feeling of fullness or satiety can be gained.</p>

The delivery system includes a proximal expandable element provided by an inflatable proximal balloon 662 and a distal expandable element provided by a distal balloon 663. The proximal balloon 662 provides a temporary seal with the proximal end 664 of the sleeve 601 at the proximal side of the valve 602. The distal balloon 665 provides a temporary<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> distal seal between a distal olive 666 and a distal end 667 of the sleeve 601. An inflation fluid is introduced into the sleeve 601 between the proximal and distal balloons 662, 665, the fluid causes the sleeve 601 to expand axially to the expanded deployed configuration. When the sleeve 601 is in the extended deployed configuration the distal balloon 665 is deflated, allowing the olive 666 to detach and travel distally. The rest of the delivery system can then be withdrawn proximally, leaving the implant device in situ. <figref idref="f0032">Fig. 84</figref> illustrates the luminal prosthesis or stent 605 with a 30mm wide proximal flare placed across the pylorus with the proximal flare resting against the pyloric antrum.

The capsule is advanced to the pre-placed stent. <figref idref="f0033">Fig. 85</figref> shows the stent, scaffold and valve with the sleeve in the retracted configuration.

The balloon 662 is not fully inflated in <figref idref="f0038">Figs. 91</figref>, <figref idref="f0039">92 and 94</figref>. A delivery catheter comprises an outer shaft 680 with a retraction hub 681 and an inner shaft 682. The shaft has various lumens and at the proximal end there are various ports connected with the lumens. There is a proximal sleeve inflation port 683, a distal tip balloon inflation port 684, a proximal seal or plunger balloon inflation port 685. There is also a guidewire port 686 (which is illustrated in <figref idref="f0041">Fig. 96</figref>) for a guidewire 687. <figref idref="f0041">Fig. 97</figref> shows the various lumens, - a water injection lumen 690 for deployment of the sleeve, - a proximal balloon inflation lumen 691, a distal tip balloon inflation lumen 692 and a guidewire lumen 693.

<p id="p0226" num="0226">Referring to <figref idref="f0039">Fig. 92</figref>, the proximal balloon 662 is inflated to seal the sleeve 601 at the proximal end and the distal balloon 665 is inflated to seal the sleeve 601 at the distal end. Water is then flushed into the retracted sleeve 601 and by virtue of the seals 662, 665 at the proximal and distal ends, the water fills the sleeve 601, causing it to extend. The sleeve 601 is shown in a partially extended configuration in <figref idref="f0039">Fig. 92</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0227" num="0227">When the sleeve 601 has fully extended (<figref idref="f0039">Fig. 93</figref>) the distal balloon 665 is deflated, allowing the tip 666 to float into the intestine for discharge.

<p id="p0229" num="0229"><figref idref="f0042">Fig. 98</figref> is a graph of the pressure profile of fixed orifice restrictors with various size orifices. The restrictions were created using a 1mm thick polyethylene membrane. Each orifice was created by drilling out the desired hole size followed by verification using a Vernier calliper. The flowrate through the test fixture was controlled at 7.86g / sec with a fluid having a viscosity of 39,000 Cps. It will be noted that when a series of fixed diameter orifice restrictors are used to<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> impede fluid flow, the resulting back-pressures generated have a distinctive pattern. The back-pressure initially rises sharply followed by a sustained gradual pressure rise until flow is stopped. This behaviour is illustrated by <figref idref="f0042">Fig. 98</figref> for 4mm, 5mm and 6mm diameter restrictions. This is undesirable for use as a flow restrictor in the stomach because a constant rise in pressure as a function of flow might give rise to gastric distress and cramping.</p>
<p id="p0230" num="0230"><figref idref="f0043">Fig. 99</figref> is a pressure profile of various different restrictions. The 6mm orifice is made as described above for <figref idref="f0042">Fig. 98</figref>. The pressure profile represented by interrupted lines is generated using a leaflet valve as described above with reference to <figref idref="f0018 f0019 f0020">Figs. 58 - 65</figref>. The valve is of a viscoelastic foam material. The foam material is in this case a material described in Example 5 of the Group 1 materials described below. The density of the material was 0.9g/ml. It can be seen from <figref idref="f0043">Fig. 99</figref> that a coapting valve of the above description enables the generation of a constant back-pressure over the duration of fluid flow. The valve is thus adapting to fluid flow to maintain a constant restrictive force independent of fluid flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p0231" num="0231">The performance of the valve can be tailored by adjusting the material density, this for example can be achieved by introducing more or less material into the valve forming mold, which subsequently expands to fill the cavity. Referring to <figref idref="f0044">Fig. 100</figref>, the valve was made using the same material as in <figref idref="f0043">Fig. 99</figref> but in this case the density was changed to approximately 0.76g/ml. Through this modification it was possible to produce a valve that generated an initially high back-pressure and subsequently adapted to the fluid flow thus lowering the back-pressure. Such a valve has an initial barrier function followed by a steady state restriction. The valve impedes flow until a pre-determined set-point pressure after which the back pressure remains substantially constant thus providing a predictable stomach emptying rate.</p>
<p id="p0232" num="0232">Various materials can be used for fabrication of the sleeve portion of the device. These materials can be for example; polyethylene, PTFE or FEP due to their low friction thus not impeding fluid flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p0233" num="0233">Referring to <figref idref="f0045">Figs. 101 and 102</figref> a sleeve 750 according to the invention has means to visualise the deployment of the sleeve using a radiopaque marker. A radiopague ink or paint is used. Because of the chemical nature of the sleeve materials the adhesion of a coating is very difficult. A longitudinal pocket 751 is provided which may be created by overlapping a portion of the sleeve material. Into this pocket 751 is deposited a radiopaque material 752 such as a liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> silicon resin filled with BaSO4, which is subsequently cured. This facilitates a low profile and a fluoroscopically distinguishable marker for visualisation in the body. Referring to <figref idref="f0045">Fig. 103</figref> in this case the sleeve has a plurality of pockets 760 which may be arranged in any desired manner to facilitate visualisation, for example at particular locations.</p>
<p id="p0234" num="0234">The duodenum begins at the pylorus and forms a curved region immediately distal to the duodenal bulb. This region, known as the descending duodenum, is where chyme begins to mix with digestive secretions from the ampulla of Vater. As the chyme begins to digest it is absorbed by the luminal surface of the duodenum. The sleeve functions to bypass this absorption mechanism. The length of the sleeve liner can be sufficient to reach the distal duodenum coincident with the ligament of treitz, where the duodenum meets the Jejunum. Alternatively the sleeve can be shorter and the inhibition of absorption through the duodenal lumen will be proportional to the length of the sleeve. Given that most of the adsorption in the duodenum happens between the ampulla of Vater and Jejunum the sleeve should at least be long enough to traverse the ampulla. In addition, when the sleeve does not extend into the ligament of treitz, the sleeve is more easily delivered as it is not required to navigate through the tortuosity of the ligament of treitz. The typical length of the sleeve may be 40cm to 45cm.</p>
<p id="p0235" num="0235"><figref idref="f0046">Fig. 104</figref> is an illustration of a host luminal prostheseis or stent 800 according to the invention. The stent 800 comprises a funnel shaped region 801 to be placed in the antrun of the stomach. The host stent shown in <figref idref="f0032">Fig. 84</figref> also has a funnel shaped region to be placed in the antrum of the stomach. Such a funnel shaped or flared region ensures that chyme flows through the lumen of the stent and not around the external surface of the stent. This is important as chyme being forced around the outside of the stent could cause compression and migration of the stent.</p>
<p id="p0236" num="0236">The funnel region 801 is connected to a softer narrower region 802 that is designed to traverse the pylorus. This region 802 is sufficiently compliant to allow the pylorus to close in response to physiological pressures.</p>
<p id="p0237" num="0237">This softer region 802 also has a means to allow coaxial connection of an obesity device such as a valve as shown in <figref idref="f0029">Fig 77</figref>. The connection of an obesity device in the proximal part of the stent is important. By this methodology any drag force experienced by the obesity device due to food passage through the lumen can be transferred to other region(s) of the stent such as a distal<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> bulbous region(s) 803 of the stent. The resulting compressive force can expand the bulbous region(s) 803 of the stent structure thus reinforcing the retention of the stent.</p>
<p id="p0238" num="0238">Connecting the bulbous region 803 to a trans-pyloric funnel 801 helps to locate the stent in the anatomy and prevent rotation of the bulb 803 perpendicular to the axis of the duodenal lumen.</p>
<p id="p0239" num="0239">The stent may also have a cylindrical region 804 that connects to the distal end of the bulbous region 803 for contacting with the tubular lumen of the duodenum.</p>
<p id="p0240" num="0240">The stent is a self expanding stent. The self expanding stent may be produced by knitting, braiding or weaving. In one case the stent is of a braided structure.</p>
<p id="p0241" num="0241">Self expanding braided or knitted stents can be made from either metal or synthetic polymers. If made from metal, a superelastic alloy is usually chosen because of the desired mechanical properties. These stents can be designed to exert significant radial force but at the same time be conformable and allow for the natural mechanical processes of digestion.</p>
<p id="p0242" num="0242">The technology might be most appropriately used in the gastro intestinal tract as described above.</p>
<p id="p0243" num="0243">One of the advantages of braided or knitted stents is that their radial diameter can be easily reduced to allow sheathing and delivery. This property is important when the stent is to be introduced into a narrow body lumen or even through the accessory channel of an endoscope.</p>
<p id="p0244" num="0244">However, because of the woven structure, the reduced diameter stent is often substantially longer than when its diameter is allowed to return to it's nominal state. This in turn causes a problem during deployment, whereby the stent foreshortens as it expands radially, making accurate placement a challenge. The user of such stents must always balance the advantages of their clinical benefit with the difficulty of delivery.</p>
<p id="p0245" num="0245">Because of the inter-relationship between the length and diameter of these stents, any force in the body that causes their elongation, will cause their diameter to shrink. This mechanical behaviour will ultimately result in loss of contact with the body lumen causing migration. Conversely, any<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> force in the body that causes the stent to be longitudinally shortened will result in an axial expansion thus re-inforcing the stents position in the body lumen.</p>
<p id="p0246" num="0246">Such a stent may elongate when a relative tensile force is applied to either end and may shorten when a compressive force is applied to either end.</p>
<p id="p0247" num="0247">There are situations in which the use of a valve in a self expanding stent may be desirable and anatomical considerations may dictate that the valve be placed either at the proximal or distal end of the stent. A valve may experience a drag force from the flow of food through its lumen. If the valve is placed at the distal end of the stent, a tensile force may be created by the flow of food through the stent, whereas a compressive force could be created if the valve is placed at the proximal end of the stent.</p>
<p id="p0248" num="0248">Although the latter is more desirable from a retention standpoint it may not always be possible to position a valve in the proximal stent. It follows that valves placed at the distal end of the stent give rise to a heightened risk of migration.</p>
<p id="p0249" num="0249">The invention provides methodologies for the transfer of forces, experienced by distally placed valves, to the proximal region of a stent. Thus, a proximally placed valve could be made to exert a compressive force on the stent.</p>
<p id="p0250" num="0250">The invention may be described broadly as follows: a stent that has an outer region 851 for contact with the body lumen, an inner region 852 for contacting with a valve (or such a prosthesis) and a connecting component for connecting the inner region to the proximal part of the outer region. One embodiment is illustrated by <figref idref="f0047">Fig. 105</figref>. The outer region may be contoured to fit the appropriate body lumen. The dimensions indicated in <figref idref="f0047">Fig. 105</figref> are particularly appropriate for a prosthesis which is to be located in the antrum of the stomach and extend through the pylorus.</p>
<p id="p0251" num="0251">The connecting region may be formed by discrete struts, wires or other structures 853 as shown in <figref idref="f0047">Figs. 106</figref> and <figref idref="f0048">107</figref>. Alternatively the inner and outer regions may be formed by one continuous stent folded so as to form coaxial inner and outer regions 851,852 <figref idref="f0047">Figs. 108</figref> and <figref idref="f0049">109</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --></p>
<p id="p0252" num="0252">There are situations in which the placement of a valve and support structure in an already deployed self expanding stent (host stent) may be desirable. Such a valve component may anchor itself in the host stent by means of radial force, friction or by some mechanically interlocking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p0253" num="0253">Any forces exerted on the stent and valve system that cause the stent to foreshorten and compress will result in an expansion of it's diameter. This behaviour would likely cause any coaxially located valve component to loose engagement with the inner lumen of the stent and thus migration would occur as shown by <figref idref="f0050">Fig. 110. Fig. 110</figref> illustrates longitudinal shortening of a stent 825 (such as a braided stent) resulting in migration of a valve device 826.</p>
<p id="p0254" num="0254">One aspect of the invention involves the addition of a non-distensible loop or series of loops 820 to the circumference of a self expanding stent restricting expansion of a section of a self expanding stent as shown by <figref idref="f0050">Figs 111</figref>, <figref idref="f0051">112</figref> and <figref idref="f0052">113</figref>. The loops 820 which may be made from a flexible material such as a polymeric or metallic thread allow radial compression of the stent during loading but limit radial expansion to the pre-determined diameter of the loop. Exemplary materials are either monofilament or braided polypropylene suture or stainless steel wire.</p>
<p id="p0255" num="0255">By using this methodology the valve component, which may be placed within the region with added loops, will not be displaced by any longitudinal forces on the stent.</p>
<p id="p0256" num="0256">Referring to <figref idref="f0053">Fig. 114</figref> there is illustrated another endoluminal prosthesis 900 according to the invention. The prosthesis is similar to the prosthesis of <figref idref="f0052">Fig. 113</figref> and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals. The prosthesis is of braided mesh construction and comprises a proximal flare or umbrella region 801, a bulbous region 803 and a duodenal region 804. A transpyloric region 901 interconnects the proximal flare 801 around the bulbous region 803.</p>
<p id="p0257" num="0257">The proximal umbrella region 801 is of open mesh and is relatively soft to avoid tissue irritation. The periphery of the proximal flare is in this case at least partially coated with a suitable coating material. The coating in this region functions as a deployment aid as it prevents sticking between the adjacent regions when the stent is in a collapsed delivery configuration. The turning of the flare distally provides some axial drag which provides resistance against dislodgment in use, for example when located at the pylorus.<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --></p>
<p id="p0258" num="0258">The transpyloric region 901 is very soft and pliable to resist force transmission from the proximal flare 801 to the bulbous region 803. The transpyloric region may be uncoated to allow some tissue ingrowth.</p>
<p id="p0259" num="0259">The bulbous region 803 acts to assist retention of the device by engaging in the duodenal bulb. The mesh is flexible in this region to adapt to the anatomy in which it is deployed. A lower part of the bulbous region 803 may be coated to prevent tissue ingrowth.</p>
<p id="p0260" num="0260">The duodenal region 804 is designed such that its diameter will not expand beyond a pre-seat limit. The braid/mesh has a weave which is more dense than the other regions as the duodenal region in this case is the region in which a valve 602 and associated scaffold 605 are deployed - as illustrated in <figref idref="f0054 f0055">Figs. 115 to 117</figref>. The valve and scaffold may, for example, be as described above - such as those described with reference to <figref idref="f0026 f0027 f0028 f0029 f0030 f0031 f0032 f0033 f0034 f0035 f0036 f0037 f0038 f0039 f0040 f0041">Figs. 73 to 97</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0261" num="0261"><figref idref="f0058">Fig. 120</figref> illustrates another luminal prosthesis 925 according to the invention which has some features similar to the prosthesis of <figref idref="f0049">Fig. 109</figref> having coaxial inner and outer regions 851, 852. In this case the inner and outer regions 851, 852 are formed by one continuous precursor stent 935 (<figref idref="f0056">Fig. 118</figref>) which is folded as illustrated in <figref idref="f0057">Fig. 119</figref>. The inner region 852 is in this case adjacent to the proximal end of the prosthesis and a scaffold and valve of the type previously described can be readily deployed. <figref idref="f0058">Fig. 121</figref> shows the luminal prosthesis of <figref idref="f0058">Fig. 120</figref> with a valve and scaffold in situ. <figref idref="f0059">Fig. 122</figref> illustrates an obesity treatment device according to the invention in situ which incorporate the device of <figref idref="f0058">Fig. 120 and 121</figref>. The arrangement ensures that any movement of the valve is effectively isolated from any forshortening or otherwise of the outer region of the stent.</p>
<p id="p0262" num="0262">Another luminal prosthesis 928 according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="f0060">Figs. 123 to 125</figref>. This prosthesis 928 is similar to the prosthesis of <figref idref="f0048">Fig. 107</figref> and <figref idref="f0060">Figs. 124 and 125</figref> illustrate how the inner part of the prosthesis is at least partially isolated from the outer part by virtue of the connection 853 which may for example define a region of at least partial articulation / hinging / pivoting.</p>
<p id="p0263" num="0263"><figref idref="f0061">Fig. 126</figref> illustrates another luminal prosthesis 925 according to the invention which is somewhat similar to the prosthesis of <figref idref="f0049">Figs. 109</figref>. The functioning of the prosthesis 925 is diagrammatically illustrated in <figref idref="f0061">Fig. 127 to 129</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --></p>
<p id="p0264" num="0264">A similar prosthesis is illustrated in <figref idref="f0061">Fig. 126</figref> and the functioning of the device is diagrammatically illustrated in <figref idref="f0061">Figs. 127 to 129</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0265" num="0265">In some cases, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0062">Figs. 130 and 131</figref> there may be an additional axially flexible connector such as at least one tether 930 between the inner and outer parts.</p>
<p id="p0266" num="0266">Referring to <figref idref="f0063">Fig. 132</figref>, in this case a prosthesis 950 comprises a bulbous part 951 which is separate from a proximal flare part 952. The parts 951, 952 may be interconnected by any suitable connector(s) 953 such as at least one tether. The proximal flare may have a partial transpyloric region to which a valve/scaffold may be mounted.</p>
<p id="p0267" num="0267">Referring to digs 133 to 139, there is illustrated another obesity treatment device 960 according to the invention. The device 960 comprises an external support 961, a valve 962 mounted to an internal support 963 and a sleeve 964 which extends in use into the duodenum as described above.</p>
<p id="p0268" num="0268">The external support 961 has a proximal flare portion 970 and a distal bulbous region 971. The distal bulbous region and the proximal flare region are connected view a transpyloric cylindrical region. The radial force of the cylindrical legion is low to allow normal functioning of the pyloric sphincter. The proximal flare portion 970 is of open mesh construction and does not require a coating. It engages with the antrum of the stomach which retains it in place. At least a distal portion of the bulbous region 971 of the external support 961 is coated.</p>
<p id="p0269" num="0269">The valve 962 is mounted to the internal support 963 and the internal support 963 in turn is engaged with the coated distal portion of the bulbous region 971 of the external support 961. The internal support 963 has integral hoops 972 which engage in the mesh of the external support 961 to assist in retaining the scaffold 963 in situ. The internal support 963 is free to move relative to the external support 961 but does not impinge upon the tissue of the duodenal bulb.</p>
<p id="p0270" num="0270">In use, when food is passing from the stomach through the valve 962 a proximal portion of the internal scaffold 963 moves relative to the external support 961 which causes axial force to be translated both distally and radially. The resultant force vector augments the radial force on the<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> external support 961 and absorbs axial force. The proximal portion of the internal support 963 can move axially distally because it is not coupled to the external support 961. The distal portion of the internal support 963 only interacts with the external support 961 and does not extend through the external support 961. The inner support 961 does not engage with the wall of the duodenal bulb.</p>
<p id="p0271" num="0271">The obesity treatment device does not interfere with the functioning of the pyloric sphincter. The pylorus functions normally whilst ensuring that the device is anchored in place. When food is passing through the valve the force applied is translated into a radial force on the duodenal bulb which is sufficiently pliant to distend and absorb this force. The device functions to retard the emptying of the stomach to give the user a prolonged feeling of saiety.</p>
<p id="p0272" num="0272">In recent years there has been a significant upsurge in commercial activity related to implantable devices to treat obesity. Some of these devices are intended for use in the pylorus and duodenum and thus require some form of retention. Current retention modalities include the use of tissue penetrating barbs, which create ulceration and pain. This gastrointestinal implant device avoids the use of such barbs.</p>
<p id="p0273" num="0273">This technology will find commercial application in the emerging area of obesity treatment for improving the retention of devices that will be exposed to the high forces associated with food flow through the GI tract.</p>
