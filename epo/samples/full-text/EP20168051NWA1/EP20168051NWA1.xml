<heading id="h0001"><b><u>Field of the Invention</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a heat sink and uses thereof. Specifically, the invention relates to a heat sink with a predetermined geometry that is suitable for use with photovoltaic solar panels.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background to the Invention</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Modern, silicon-based photovoltaic solar panels can produce 20% efficiencies when tested under standard conditions of 1000W/m<sup>2</sup> at 25°C and are rated to last for 20 years. That is, for a given power of sunlight incident on the panel surface, 20% of this is converted to electricity. The other 80% is reflected or generates heat leading to significant temperature rises in the panel. In areas with high solar irradiance, and high air temperature, the panel temperature can exceed 100 °C. The immediate effect of this is to reduce panel efficiency due to temperature dependencies in the underlying physics, but also to accelerate natural degradation mechanisms which depend exponentially on temperature. In general, efficiency decreases by 0.5% for every degree the panel is above 25 °C. The panel lifetime depends on the average annual panel temperature, and halves for every 10 °C above 25 °C. Large temperature swings such as those seen in desert climates can also significantly accelerate panel degradation.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The long-term degradation of solar photovoltaic (PV) cells is well known in the industry and panel manufactures provide warrantees which include this degradation. This degradation rate can be up to 2% in the first two years, and then reduces approximately linearly at a slower rate. The rate of efficiency loss is known as the power coefficient β and for modern silicon solar cell designs is between 0.3-0.6% per annum or more depending on the cell technology and panel geometry. Ideally, after the agreed term -20 years, the panel should still be producing electricity at 80% of its rated efficiency. To achieve this the power coefficient should be less than 1%.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Twenty years is an extremely long time for a product to remain in service, and critical failure can occur due to a number of different effects, including but not limited to, water ingress, physical damage, sand abrasion, cementation, frame corrosion, back panel degradation, delamination, overheating, shading effects, short circuits, open circuits,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> damage of intra and inter cell connections. As such, extremely high-quality starting materials and manufacturing process must be used to guarantee efficiency over operational lifetime. Some companies focus on longevity of various components of the solar cell and solar panel construction. They produce conductive inks, adhesives and solar backplates with a focus on quality for extreme conditions. Elevated operating temperature has particularly adverse effects in arid, semi-arid and tropical environments where cell degradation can be significantly accelerated.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Previously proposed cooling technologies include natural air convection, forced air convection, natural fluid convection, forced fluid convection, spray cooling, radiative cooling, active cooling, and thermoelectric cooling. These cooling mechanisms come at additional energy or capital cost, or require large amounts of water, which is often scarce in arid areas in which solar is deployed.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2018117337A"><text>WO 2018/117337</text></patcit> describes a solar cell cooling device that utilises both natural convective air flow and forced convective air flow through a series of spaced-apart fins having an air inlet and an air outlet. The problem with this device is that narrowing the space of the channel will increase airflow, but this is not an effective approach when using natural convection, as the geometry of the device will result in increased viscous drag and reduce the airflow rate.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="CN204597884"><text>CN204597884</text></patcit> describes a photovoltaic module junction box heat sink. The heat sink is made from aluminium, which is adhered to a heat conductive graphite paste. This patent refers to dissipating excess heat at the junction box only and does not relate to cooling the entire back section of a solar panel.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2010080204A"><text>WO 2010/080204</text></patcit> describes a solar receiver (a base plate having a first surface and a second surface, a plurality of solar cells positioned over and supported by the first surface of the base plate) with a heat sink. The heat sink can be made from aluminium or copper and comprises a plurality of fins formed or fabricated from one continuous roll or sheet of material and bent to form a serpentine configuration. This heat sink refers to the application of concentrated photovoltaics (CPV), which is quite different to the PV geometry used in standard PV panels.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to overcome at least one of the above-mentioned problems.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Due to the relatively low heat source density expected in photovoltaic solar panels (&lt;2000 W/m<sup>2</sup>), and the large thermal resistance of the back plate, even a very low efficiency heat sink could have a significant effect on the steady state temperature. Previous works have taken passive natural convection heat sink designs from integrated electronics, and automotive applications, where relatively large heat source densities must be dissipated. They concluded that passive heat sinking of photovoltaic solar panels was not cost effective due to the quantity of aluminium required. One of the aims here is to show that, with the lower heat source density in solar panels, the inventors can use much less aluminium material, or even change material to polymers, or carbon-based materials for example. This will allow for better heat sink design and achieve a significant reduction in steady state operating temperature in a cost-effective manner. The inventors have identified that that conversion efficiency and panel lifetime can be significantly reduced when panels are deployed on sites depending on local climate. The efficiency and lifetime of photovoltaic solar panels are key parameters which directly affect the cost of photovoltaic solar panels. This determines its competitiveness and share in the energy mix, and ultimately the monetary and carbon footprint cost to each consumer.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The efficiency drop with increasing temperature is due to the temperature dependence of the bandgap of the semiconductor material. This temperature dependence is accounted for in the diode equation, which describes the electrical performance of the photovoltaic cell. Temperature dependence of efficiency is an important property regardless of the underlying solar cell technology and the invention described herein could be used with many photovoltaic technologies including but not limited to monocrystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous silicon, thin film cells, cadmium telluride, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGs), organic solar cells, perovskite solar cells, multifunction cells, dye sensitised solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, plasmonic and nanocrystal sensitised solar cells. This technology could also be used to improve the performance of electrochemical cells or fuel cells or thermoelectric generators.</p>

<heading id="h0004"><i><u>Definitions</u></i></heading>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the specification, the term "heat sink" should be understood to mean a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at optimal levels. The heat sink may operate using conduction, convention or radiative heat transfer, or a combination of these mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In the specification, the term "solar panel" or "solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or systems" are interchangeable terms that should be understood to mean an assembly of photovoltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. Photovoltaic cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of PV cells is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment. Solar panels can be unifacial or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> monofacial (accepting light from one side only) or bifacial (accepting light from both sides).</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In the specification, the term "natural convection", "passive convection", or "free convection" should be understood to mean a mechanism, or type of mass and heat transport, in which the fluid motion of air is generated only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients, not by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, <i>etc.</i>)<i>.</i> The driving force for natural convection is gravity. The terms can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In the specification, the term "forced convection" should be understood to mean a mechanism in which the fluid motion of air is generated by an external source such as a pump, a fan, a suction device, or wind <i>etc.</i></p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In the specification, the term "base plate" should be understood to mean a plate which supports the fins to stand in a fixed direction. The base plate can be continuous connecting all the fins or can be separate for each individual fin. The base plate can be made from metal such as aluminium, or transparent materials such as glass or polymer, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the specification, the term "solar panel mounting system" or "photovoltaic mounting systems" should be understood to mean a system of support structures which allow the panel to be mounted on a pitched roof, mounted on a flat roof, mounted on a wall. mounted on a pole, ground mounted, or mounted on floating platform.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">In the specification, the term "segmented" should be understood to mean where a plurality of fins attached to, for example, the back of a photovoltaic solar panel are adhered in a series of segments rather than in a single block of fins.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In the specification, the term "top support" should be understood to mean a support placed on the upper peak of the plurality of fins. The top support may be made from the same material as the fins or a different material and is to provide mechanical stability.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In the specification, the term "an airflow isolation means" should be understood to mean a method of keeping air separate in each of the sections of fins to avoid mutual heat exchange between sections.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">The term "polymer" in the specification should be understood to mean a large molecule (macromolecule) composed of repeating structural units. These subunits are typically connected by covalent chemical bonds. Although the term "polymer" is sometimes taken to refer to plastics, it actually encompasses a large class comprising both natural and synthetic materials with a wide variety of properties. Such polymers may be thermoplastics, elastomers, or biopolymers.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The term "copolymer" should be understood to mean a polymer derived from two (or more) monomeric species, for example a combination of any two of the below-mentioned polymers. An example of a copolymer, but not limited to such, is PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), which is a PET modified by copolymerization. PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection moulded or sheet extruded and has superior barrier performance used in the container industry.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The term "thermoset" should be understood to mean materials that are made by polymers joined together by chemical bonds, acquiring a highly cross-linked polymer structure. The highly cross-linked structure produced by chemical bonds in thermoset materials is directly responsible for the high mechanical and physical strength when compared with thermoplastics or elastomers materials.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">The invention described herein does not accelerate airflow like some of the heat sink designs of the prior art. The invention described herein illustrates that increasing the height of a plurality of fins from the bottom to the top of the solar panel will help to create more uniform cooling.

<p id="p0055" num="0055">The invention described herein applies to standard solar photovoltaic panels (PV). Standard PV generates much lower heat flux and it is not obvious that heat sinking would work well in this situation.

<p id="p0057" num="0057">The inventors propose using thermally conductive films such as metallic films, carbon-based films, or polymer films doped with conductive particles to create a novel heat sink. Combinations of these films could also be used. These materials can be manufactured on a large-scale using extrusion and/or roll-to-roll processing. Pyrolytic graphite film, for example, is very low density (1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and has extremely high thermal conductivity (1950 W/m/K), 9.5-times that of aluminium. Currently, it is primarily used as a heat spreader in electronic devices. Because of its high thermal conductivity, much thinner layers can be used as compared to aluminium which significantly reduces weight and material cost. The graphite used can be either synthetic or natural (mined from the ground). It is processed into a roll which allows for efficient transport. It can be purchased in large quantities from manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">The heat sink of the claimed invention can use an origami-inspired approach to create novel high-surface area heat sink designs from the film starter material. This heat sink can be attached directly to the backplate of a solar panel or attached to a photovoltaic solar panel frame as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>.</b> Examples of a simple straight fin geometry are shown applied to a 50W panel in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 1(a)</b></figref><b>,</b> and a standard 320W panel in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>(b-c).</b> <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 1(b)</b></figref> shows the fin orientation when the panel is intended to be mounted in a landscape orientation. <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 1(c)</b></figref> shows the case when the panel is intended to be mounted in a portrait orientation. The fins should always be aligned with gravity so that natural convection work effectively.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The heat sink can be constructed from individual fins which are assembled as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(a)</b></figref><b>.</b> This consists of individually mounted fins as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(b)</b></figref> mounted as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(c)</b></figref><b>.</b> In this case, a triangular base mount is used. This may attach the fin directly to the back of the panel or to a baseplate. In <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(d)</b></figref> an alternative rectangular base mount is shown. They may be mounted separately as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(e)</b></figref> or combined into a single unit before application, such as in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(f)</b></figref><b>.</b> Alternatively, the fins may be attached to a single baseplate as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(g)</b></figref><b>.</b> The fins may be folded to attach to the back of the panel, or the baseplate as shown in <figref idref="f0001"><b>Figure 2(h)</b></figref><b>.</b> These base mounts and baseplates can be made from the same material as the fin or from a different material. They can be transparent or opaque and made from metal, polymer, or glass, or a combination to these. They may<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> be matched to the thermal expansion coefficient of the backplate, solar glass or other photovoltaic solar panel material.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The fins may be made from a single high thermal conductivity material as shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3(a)</b></figref> or may be made from a high thermal conductivity material adhered to a supporting material as shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3(b)</b></figref><b>.</b> They may be made from a continuous high thermal conductivity material encapsulated in a supporting material, as shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3(c)</b></figref><b>,</b> or a discontinuous high thermal conductivity material dispersed in a supporting material, as shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3(d)</b></figref><b>.</b></p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">In one embodiment, the heat sink structure can be created from a single film or material, or from multiple sections. These films may have the structures described in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref><b>.</b> By creating bends and folds in the design, different heat sinks can be created by periodically adhering the film to the back of the panel or the baseplate. Some representative cross sections are shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(a)</b></figref><b>-(h).</b> The thermal resistance of the heat sink can be tuned to match the solar panel design by choosing a material with a particular thermal conductivity <b>κ</b>, a film thickness <b>t,</b> a height of the film <b>h,</b> and a periodicity <b>A.</b> The heat sinks can be constructed in a way to create rigid structures, with some cross-section examples shown as plate fins in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(a)</b></figref><b>,</b> as trapezoidal in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(b)</b></figref><b>,</b> as sinusoidal in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(c)</b></figref> and as triangular in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(d)</b></figref><b>.</b> Some films may form naturally into a shape similar to that shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(e)</b></figref><b>.</b> A supporting top structure can be applied to any of the cross sections to improve mechanical stability, as shown with the sinusoidal cross section in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(f)</b></figref><b>.</b> The heat sink could also be left to hang flexibly, as depicted in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4(g)</b> and <b>Figure 4(h)</b></figref> Free moving structures have the advantage of moving with the wind, which would enhance heat transfer through forced convection and turbulence. The heat sinks of the claimed invention do not need to be periodic or ordered. They may have sinusoidal, triangular, undulating, square, rectangular or fractal cross sections. When they are periodic, they can have multiple periodicities or vary depending on the position the heat sink of the claimed invention takes on the panel.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">Side views of embodiments of the invention are shown in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figures 5(a)</b></figref><b>-(j).</b> The fin structures may be continuous along the entire panel length or applied in sections as shown in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5(a)</b> and <b>Figure 5(b)</b></figref><b>,</b> respectively. Examples are shown with 3-4 sections, however there may be any number of sections as the user sees fit. The fin height may vary as a function of panel position. An example of a linear variation is<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> shown in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5(c)</b></figref><b>,</b> and in the segmented design in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5(d)</b></figref><b>.</b> An additional structure could be used to separate airflow from each of the sections, as indicated by the black line in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5(e)</b></figref><b>.</b> For some panels, such as bifacial panels, transparent base plates and fins, or highly reflective fins, are typically used. It would be possible to use these heat sinks on the front surface of the panel also. The same concepts are shown both on front and back of panel in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5(f)</b></figref><b>-(j).</b></p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">photovoltaic solar panels are mounted at an angle to optimise solar irradiation. Shallow angles may cause issues for natural convection, with air getting trapped beneath the panel. The design may require modification of the top and bottom parts of the frame holding the panel to allow air to flow across the heatsink surface. The heatsinks could be segmented, or the length of the heat sink could be varied depending on position on the panel to optimise natural convection heat transfer, and to ensure uniform cooling. The heatsinks could be mounted as strips with gaps between these to allow airflow to move through. The heat sink may be long enough to protrude from the back of the panel surface, or it may be short enough to be completely hidden by the panel frame. Full back panel views of segmented fins are shown in <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 6</b></figref><b>.</b> Simple parallel rectangular fins are shown. These fins may be made from any of the materials or layer structures outlined in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref><b>.</b> They may have other cross sections, such as those outlined in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4</b></figref><b>.</b> They may have any number of different types of sections, as shown in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Figure 5</b></figref><b>.</b> <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 6(a)</b></figref><b>-(c)</b> shows isometric, back and side views of an example of a 320Wp solar panel with simple rectangular fins. <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 6(d)</b></figref><b>-(f)</b> shows isometric, back and side views of a segmented design with tapered fins. A simple linear, tapered design is shown, however other tapered designs could be used. In segmented designs, sections may have different fin height, periodicity and thickness. Sections may be made of different materials. Sections may be offset to disrupt airflow between each segment.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Good adhesion between the heat sink and the photovoltaic solar panel and the fin structure and base is very important to ensure good thermal contact. There are several commercially available glues and epoxies that can be used. <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 7</b></figref> outlines some example adhesion techniques. <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 7(a)</b></figref> shows adhesion using glue with a sinusoidal cross section design. Designs such as trapezoidal cross section may allow larger contact area and better thermal contact as shown in <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 7(b)</b></figref><b>.</b> The heatsink may be attached without using glue, just by applying pressure against the frame. Bars could be used to evenly apply the pressure as shown in cross section in <figref idref="f0004"><b>Figure 7(c)</b></figref><b>.</b><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">An alternative would be to mechanically fix the heat sink to the backplate using various securing means such as a nail, a screw, a tack, snap-fit configuration, adhesive, and the like. A combination of both techniques could be used. The contact area should be controlled in order to tune the thermal resistance of the heat sink and ensure uniform cooling.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">To demonstrate the performance of the heat sink of the claimed invention, the inventors created a test rig where heater pads were inserted in a standard solar panel geometry, which allowed precise control of the heat source while monitoring cell temperature, surface glass temperature, and the heat flux through the back surface of the panel. <figref idref="f0005"><b>Figure 8(a)</b></figref> shows IR thermal images of the front of the test bed. The panel on the left has no heat sink, whereas the panel on the right has an aluminium heat sink with a fin thickness of 0.5 mm. To test performance under different conditions, the current in the heater pad is controlled such that the heat source density changes from 100W/m<sup>2</sup> to 800W/m<sup>2</sup>. <figref idref="f0005"><b>Figure 8(b)</b></figref> shows the resulting solar cell temperature measured experimentally (data points) and predicted using numerical simulations (solid line).</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The inventors also compared the performance of two identical monocrystalline 50W solar panels with and without the heat sink of the claimed invention. The panels were placed outdoors in realistic weather conditions at the beginning of March in Ireland (see <figref idref="f0006"><b>Figure 9(a)</b></figref><b>-(c)</b>). Maximum solar irradiance was measured at 600W/m<sup>2</sup> and the background temperature was 10°C. The backside of the panel with no technology reached 30°C, whereas the backside temperature with the technology remained below 25°C. Even with a small change in temperature, a significant increase of 27% in output power from the panel with the heat sink of the claimed invention was observed.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The inventors performed extensive analytical and numerical studies to optimise the design. <figref idref="f0007"><b>Figure 10</b></figref> illustrates the relationship between the optimum fin spacing and the panel height at various temperatures, calculated using analytical theory. The optimum spacing depends on aspect ratio and the expected fin operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The optimum fin height and thickness are calculated using numerical FEM simulations. In <figref idref="f0007"><b>Figure 11</b></figref><b>,</b> it is shown that for the aluminium foil (a thickness of 0.05mm) there is a reduced benefit in increasing the fin height past 50 mm. This is because the thermal resistance is large and the thermal gradient along the fin height is significant. Increasing the height of the fin beyond this has minimal effect because the temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> difference between the fin and the air is too low to exchange a reasonable amount of heat. For the thicker aluminium sheet (0.5 mm) there are benefits out to 10 cm, however this will add additional cost and weight to the device.</p>

<p id="p0070" num="0070">A typical layout of a photovoltaic solar panel is a layer of glass, a first encapsulant layer, a solar cell, a second encapsulant layer, and a back sheet. The glass is low iron tempered glass and usually between 2.8-4 mm thick. It provides the main structural support for the solar cells, which are extremely thin and brittle. The encapsulant is usually a form of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) optimized to withstand prolonged UV exposure. The back sheet can be made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or propriety materials such as DuPont™ Tedlar® (a polyvinyl fluoride film). These materials must protect the cells from moisture ingress and temperature cycling.</p>
<heading id="h0009"><i>Heat sink materials</i></heading>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">The proposed heat sink can be made from any material with high thermal conductivity (&gt;50W/m/K). In particular, the inventors have demonstrated the heat sink of the claimed invention using aluminium and expanded graphite. The high thermal conductivity material may be supported or encapsulated by a low thermal conductivity material in geometries as depicted in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref><b>.</b> Metals including but not limited to aluminium, copper, stainless steel, titanium and alloys containing these elements. Carbon-based materials including but not limited to graphite, pyrolytic graphite, expanded graphite, diamond, carbon filler, carbon nanotubes, graphene are of particular interest due to low density, high thermal conductivity and high IR emissivity. Other high thermal conductivity materials such as aluminium nitride, silicon nitride and boron nitride are of interest.</p>
<heading id="h0010"><i>Heat sink Testing</i></heading>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">To reproduce the effects of heating due to solar irradiation of a solar panel in a quantitative and reproducible fashion, the inventors devised a simple rig with a silicone heating mat in place of a silicon solar cell. A glass front panel and a polycarbonate back panel were cut to area 17cm x 17cm. The glass was 2.8mm thick and the PC panel was 1.5 mm thick. A heating mat was used with an input voltage of 12V, and maximum power dissipation of 15W. This permitted the inventors to get up to 800 W/m<sup>2</sup> as a heat source density, which is enough to represent solar panels under standard<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> test conditions. A thermal image of the front surface (glass) is shown of the device without and with the heat sink on left and right-hand sides respectively in <figref idref="f0005"><b>Figure 8(a)</b></figref><b>.</b> The image is taken with a heat source density of 800 W/m<sup>2</sup> .The current was controlled to sweep the heat source density from 100 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 800 W/m<sup>2</sup> and the cell temperature was monitored with and embedded thermocouple for the cases with and without the heat sink. The results are shown in <figref idref="f0005"><b>Figure 8(b)</b></figref><b>.</b> The experimental measurements are shown as data points, whereas the solid lines represent the prediction of numerical models performed using the 3D finite element method. In extreme environments, panels could experience peak heat source densities of 1920 W/m<sup>2</sup>. A higher power heating mat is required to simulate these conditions.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">As a further demonstration a standard 50W photovoltaic solar panel was fitted with a heat sink made using a 0.5mm aluminium sheet. Individual fins were adhered to the back of the solar panel without the use of a back plate to reduce cost. <figref idref="f0006"><b>Figure 9(a)</b></figref> shows visible and thermal images of the device of the claimed invention in outdoor conditions under 600W/m<sup>2</sup> solar irradiance.

<heading id="h0011"><i>Optimum design</i></heading>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">The important parameters for the natural convection heat sink design are the fin height <b><i>h<sub>fin</sub></i>,</b> the fin thickness <b><i>t<sub>fin</sub></i></b> and the fin spacing <b><i>S</i></b>. The fins define air channels of thickness (fin spacing) <b><i>S</i>,</b> and the fluid properties, temperature difference and aspect ratio of the problem determine the optimum fin spacing <b>S<sub>opt</sub></b>. In natural convection there is no external driving force and one must rely on buoyancy to drive the airflow. As such, the balance between buoyancy force and viscous drag is critical and determines the steady state fluid flow. There are several dimensionless parameters which can be used to characterize different regimes of fluid flow. The optimum spacing <b><i>S<sub>opt</sub></i></b> can be found analytically for flat plate geometry and is well known from the academic literature (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Thermally Optimum Spacing of Vertical, Natural Convection Cooled, Parallel Plates, A. Bar-Choen, and W.M. Rohsenow, Transactions of ASME, 116/Vol. 106, FEBRUARY 1984</text></nplcit>) [1].<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">In one embodiment of the present invention, an optimum spacing of 0.8 cm for the 17 cm testbed was preferred, increasing to 1.4 cm for a standard 320W panel of height 1.5 m. A simple fin-type heat sink was chosen to allow simple analytical expression to understand scaling. The fin structure could be made with more complicated cross sections such as those shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>Figure 4</b></figref> and this would change the optimum parameters slightly. Fin length, spacing and thickness could be changed as a function of position on a photovoltaic solar panel in order to ensure uniform temperature of the cells in the photovoltaic solar panel, if this is deemed important.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">The optimum fin spacing derived above assumes the fins are uniform temperature and are of negligible thickness, so they effectively have very high thermal conductivity. Realistic fin performance will depend on its thermal resistance, and there will be an optimum thickness and length. The optimum fin thickness and length for a specific fin material can be determined using finite element method numerical simulations. These simulations performed by the inventors include heat transfer due to conduction, convection and radiation and a full analysis of the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">The optimum fin length <b><i>h<sub>fin</sub></i></b> depends on the temperature difference, but also the fin thickness and the material thermal conductivity. Using a high thermal conductivity material or thicker fin allows similar performance to be achieved at a shorter fin length. The inventors used two thicknesses of 0.05 mm and 0.5 mm to demonstrate this for fins made from aluminium and graphite foil, a synthetic high thermal conductive material, as shown in <figref idref="f0007"><b>Figure 11</b></figref><b>.</b> The thinner sample of 0.05 mm is representative of aluminium foil, which has a thickness in this range. The solar panel surface temperature is shown to decrease appreciably up to 50 mm, after which there are little gains. The thicker fin (0.5 mm) represents thin sheet metal which is more rigid. This shows a significantly lower temperature and gains are continued to be observed out to 100mm. In this case, the cost and weight of the aluminium become a factor and the optimum length will need to be decided as a trade-off between cost, weight and performance.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">The use of a synthetic graphite foil with a thermal conductivity of 1500W/m/K is almost 8-times more thermally conductive than aluminium and has a lower density. The simulations show a slight improvement with the 0.5 mm thickness case as compared to 0.5 mm of aluminium. However, the more exciting result is that the 0.05 mm graphite<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> film fin still outperforms the 0.5 mm aluminium fin. This graphite film fin is likely to be more expensive than aluminium, however it seems that one could use significantly less material, which would allow a user to save on cost and weight.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">Although many different cooling technologies have been proposed in the past, they have not proven economically viable for large scale photovoltaic solar panel farms. The heat sink of the claimed invention can be retrofitted to existing solar panels in order to increase electricity output and prolong the lifetime of the solar panels themselves. The heat sink of the claimed invention can be added post-production to existing back sheet solar panels, or the heat sink itself could serve the function of the back sheet and be integrated at the panel manufacturing stage. The cost of photovoltaic solar panels has decreased by a factor of 10 in the last 5 years. In some arid regions, with high solar irradiance, such as parts of India, solar power generation has become cheaper than fossil fuels. The use of the heat sink of the claimed invention could lower the cost of production even further allowing solar panel farms globally to compete with other renewable and non-renewable power generation technologies.</p>
