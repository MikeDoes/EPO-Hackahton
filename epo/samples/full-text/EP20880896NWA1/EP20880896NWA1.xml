<p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to reduce the running resistance of tires,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> there is a method of reducing hysteresis loss of vulcanized rubber, and rebound resilience at 50°C to 80°C, tan δ, Goodrich heating, or the like is used as an evaluation index of the vulcanized rubber. That is, it is desirable to use a rubber material having high rebound resilience at the above temperature or a low tan δ value or Goodrich heating.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">As a method for accomplishing the requirement, a method for decreasing the heating properties of tires using an inorganic filler such as silica and carbon black in a rubber composition for forming tires has been suggested. However, the dispersion of the inorganic filler in the rubber composition is not favorable, and defects of degrading overall physical properties of the rubber composition including abrasion resistance, crack resistance or processability arise.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to solve such problems, a method for modifying the polymerization active part of a conjugated diene-based polymer which is obtained by anionic polymerization using an organolithium with a modifier containing a functional group which is capable of interacting with an inorganic filler, has been suggested as a method for increasing the dispersibility of an inorganic filler such as silica and carbon black in a rubber composition. However, even the low heating properties are improved, tensile properties, abrasion resistance and processability are still<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> deteriorated.</p>

It means that if a coupling number is 1, the entire polymer chains composing the polymer are uncoupled, and if the coupling number is F, the entire polymer chains are coupled.</p>
<heading id="h0014"><b><u>Measurement method and conditions</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In the present disclosure, the "1,2-vinyl bond content" is measured and analyzed using Varian VNMRS 500 MHz NMR, and the 1,2-vinyl bond content in each polymer is calculated and measured by using 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as a solvent during measuring NMR, and calculating 6.0 ppm as a solvent peak, 7.2-6.9 ppm as random styrene peaks, 6.9-6.2 ppm as block styrene peaks, 5.8-5.1 ppm as 1,4-vinyl and 1,2-vinyl peaks, and 5.1-4.5 ppm as 1,2-vinyl peaks.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">In the present disclosure, "weight average molecular<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> weight (Mw)", "number average molecular weight (Mn)", and "molecular weight distribution (MWD)" are measured through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis and are measured by checking a molecular weight distribution curve. The molecular weight distribution (PDI, MWD, Mw/Mn) is calculated from each molecular weight measured. Particularly, the GPC uses two columns of PLgel Olexis (Polymer laboratories Co.) and one column of PLgel mixed-C (Polymer Laboratories Co.) in combination, and polystyrene (PS) is used as a GPC standard material for calculating the molecular weights, and tetrahydrofuran mixed with 2 wt% of an amine compound is used as a GPC measurement solvent.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In the present disclosure, for measuring the "mooney viscosity (MV)" and "mooney stress relaxation ratio (-S/R)", the mooney viscosity (MV, (ML1+4, @100°C MU) is measured using MV-2000 (ALPHA Technologies Co.) using Large Rotor at a rotor speed of 2±0.02 rpm at 110°C. In this case, a specimen used is stood at room temperature (23±3°C) for 30 minutes or more, and 27±3 g of the specimen is collected and put in a die cavity, and then, Platen is operated for 4 minutes for measurement. After measuring the mooney viscosity, the slope value of the change of the mooney viscosity shown while releasing torque is measured, and the absolute value thereof is considered as the mooney stress relaxation ratio.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In the present disclosure, the "Si content" is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Optima 7300DV) as an ICP analysis method. If the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy is used, measurement is performed by adding about 0.7 g of a specimen to a platinum (Pt) crucible, adding about 1 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (98 wt%, electronic grade) thereto, heating at 300°C for 3 hours, incinerating the specimen in an electrical furnace (Thermo Scientific, Lindberg Blue M) by the following program of steps 1 to 3:
<ol id="ol0001" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1) step 1: initial temp 0°C, rate (temp/hr) 180°C/hr, temp (holdtime) 180°C (1hr),</li>
<li>2) step 2: initial temp 180°C, rate (temp/hr) 85°C/hr, temp (holdtime) 370°C (2hr), and</li>
<li>3) step 3: initial temp 370°C, rate (temp/hr) 47°C/hr, temp (holdtime) 510°C (3hr),</li>
</ol>
adding 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid (48 wt%) and 20 µl of concentrated hydrofluoric acid (50 wt%) to a residue, sealing the platinum crucible and shaking for 30 minutes or more, adding 1 mL of boric acid to the specimen, storing at 0°C for 2 hours or more, diluting in 30 ml of ultrapure water, and performing incineration.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In the present disclosure, the "N content" may be measured through an NSX analysis method, and measurement by the NSX analysis method may use a quantitative analyzer of a trace amount of nitrogen (NSX-2100H). For example, in case<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of using the quantitative analyzer of a trace amount of nitrogen, the quantitative analyzer of a trace amount of nitrogen (Auto sampler, Horizontal furnace, PMT &amp; Nitrogen detector) is turned on, carrier gas flow amounts are set to 250 ml/min for Ar, 350 ml/min for O<sub>2</sub>, and 300 ml/min for ozonizer, a heater is set to 800°C, and the analyzer is stood for about 3 hours for stabilization. After stabilizing the analyzer, a calibration curve of calibration curve ranges of 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 500 ppm is made using Nitrogen standard (AccuStandard S-22750-01-5 ml), and an area corresponding to each concentration is obtained. Then, by using the ratios of concentrations to areas, a straight line is made. After that, a ceramic boat holding 20 mg of a specimen is put in the auto sampler of the analyzer and measurement is conducted to obtain an area. By using the area of the specimen thus obtained and the calibration curve, the N content is calculated. In this case, the specimen is a modified conjugated diene-based polymer from which solvents are removed by putting the specimen in hot water heated by steam and stirring, and may be a specimen from which remaining monomers, remaining modifiers and oil are removed.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In the present disclosure, "M10 (10% modulus) and tensile strength" were obtained by manufacturing each specimen based on the tensile test method of ASTM D6746 and measuring the tensile strength of the specimen when broken<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> and the tensile stress when expanded by 10% (10% modulus). Particularly, the tensile properties were measured using a Universal Test Machin 4204 (Instron Co.) tensile tester at room temperature in a rate of 50 cm/min.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The present invention provides a modified conjugated diene-based polymer having physical properties in specific ranges in combination and, if applied to a rubber composition, capable of controlling the modulus and tensile strength of the rubber composition to specific numerical ranges or more.</p>

However, generally, the mooney stress relaxation ratio may be concerned with the mooney viscosity. With the equal level of mooney viscosity, the mooney stress relaxation ratio may become quite different according to the degree of branching of the polymer. For example, the mooney stress relaxation ratio may decrease with the increase of the branches of the modified conjugated diene-based polymer and thus, with the equal level of mooney viscosity, the mooney stress relaxation ratio may not be the same due to the difference of the degree of branching.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Meanwhile, since the modified conjugated diene-based polymer according to an embodiment of the present invention satisfies the aforementioned mooney stress relaxation ratio at the aforementioned mooney viscosity, processability may be excellent, the degree of branching may be controlled, and mechanical properties such as tensile strength may be excellent.</p>

<p id="p0089" num="0089">Meanwhile, the polymerization of step (S1) may be performed by including a polar additive, and the polar additive may be added in a ratio of 0.001 g to 50 g, or 0.002 g to 0.1 g based on total 100 g of the monomer.

If the polar additive is included, and if a conjugated diene-based monomer, or a conjugated diene-based monomer and an aromatic vinyl-based monomer are copolymerized, the difference of reaction rates may be compensated, and effects of inducing easy formation of a random copolymer may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the reaction of step (S2), the modifier may be used in an amount of 0.01 mmol to 10 mmol based on total 100 g of the<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> monomer.

Particularly, in case of injecting the modifier in installments, the modifier firstly injected reacts with an active polymer primarily to form the polymer chain of a polymer having a high coupling number, and the modifier secondly injected reacts secondly with an unmodified active polymer remaining to additionally form the polymer chain of a polymer having a high coupling number, thereby producing a modified conjugated diene-based polymer having a coupling number of 3.2 or more and a mooney stress relaxation ratio of 0.4 or less. In this case, the separated modifier may be injected into a transport part and a modification reactor one by one, into a transport part one by one, or into a modification reactor one by one.</p>

Thus, the silane coupling agent may be used in an amount of 1 part by weight to 20 parts by weight, or 5 parts by weight to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of silica.
