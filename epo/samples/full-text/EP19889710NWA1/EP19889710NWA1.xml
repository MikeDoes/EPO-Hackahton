<p id="p0117" num="0117">The crRNA contains a nucleic acid sequence consisting of about 17 to 20 bases (herein, sometimes referred to as a "target recognition sequence") hybridizing with a base sequence (herein, sometimes referred to as a "target sequence"), which is a target for gene modification in the genome or gene locus within a cell. The target sequence is located adjacent to a short sequence (called as a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)) and recognized by the CRISPR system. The condition of the sequence and length of PAM vary depending on the type of nuclease to be employed;<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> however, PAM is typically a sequence consisting of 2 to 5 base-pairs and located adjacent to a target sequence.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">The target sequence is not particularly limited as long as it satisfies the above conditions for PAM and can be appropriately selected depending on the intended use. The target sequence is typically a sequence involved in a genetic disease, that is, a sequence contained in a gene locus, which is a potential target for gene therapy or contained in a gene locus involved in infection with a pathogen such as a bacterium and a virus.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the target sequence is a base sequence of a gene locus containing a dystrophin gene. More specifically, the target sequence is a base sequence, a modification (deletion or insertion) of which corrects a frameshift mutation or a nonsense mutation of a dystrophin gene, thereby preventing or treating a dystrophinopathy (for example, muscular dystrophy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy and dystrophin gene dilated cardiomyopathy). Alternatively, the target sequence is a base sequence of the dystrophin gene, which<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> can produce dystrophin protein produced by gene correction of a frameshift mutation or a nonsense mutation.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">Dystrophinopathy refers to various diseases caused by a dysfunctional dystrophin protein or dystrophin protein having an abnormal function caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene. Examples of dystrophinopathy includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy and dystrophin gene-related dilated cardiomyopathy. In most cases, skeletal muscle disorder is a main symptom; however, there is a case where no skeletal muscle symptom is observed. Dystrophinopathy is sometimes associated with hypercreatininemia, myoglobinuria, dilated cardiomyopathy, cognitive impairment and the like.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">Muscular dystrophy is defined as a "hereditary disease having degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscle, as a main lesion, and progressive muscle weakness, as a clinical observation". Examples of the muscular dystrophy that is known include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, Miyoshi muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy.<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --></p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">Duchenne muscular dystrophy is pediatric muscular dystrophy known to have the largest number of patients and a prevalence rate of 4 to 5 per 100,000 persons. Progressive muscle atrophy is a main symptom and a dysfunctional by mutation dystrophin gene on the X chromosome is a cause. Over half patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a single or a plurality of defective exons. The dystrophin-protein reading frame shifts by a dystrophin gene mutation and a stop codon appears in the middle of the frame, with the result that no dystrophin protein is synthesized, causing a series of symptoms.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">The dystrophin gene is an extremely large gene consisting of more than 2,200,000 bases and present on X chromosome. Various isoforms are present due to different transcriptional initiation points. Examples of the isoforms that are known include Dp71 expressed in a whole body, Dp116 expressed in terminal nerve cells, Dp140 expressed in the brain and kidney, Dp260 expressed in the retina, Dp417p expressed in Purkinje neurons, Dp427b expressed in the brain, and Dp427m expressed in the skeletal muscle. Of them, dystrophin protein produced by Dp427m isoform is a protein expressed mainly in muscle cells. Dystrophin protein binds to cytoskeleton actin through the actin<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> binding domain present at the N-terminal side and binds to a dystroglycan complex through the high-cysteine domain present at the C-terminal side to constitute the cytoskeleton in concert with actin. The dystrophin gene of Dp427m isoform is constituted of 79 exons.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">In the case of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, functional dystrophin protein is virtually not expressed (the amount of the protein detected by western blotting is 3% or less of that of a healthy person) due to a defective exon or duplicate mutation in the dystrophin gene or a point mutation (nonsense mutation) of a base in an exon or insertion/defective mutation (frameshift mutation). Whereas, in the case of patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, which is relatively milder than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, even if a defective exon and a base point-mutation are present, if a stop codon is not present in the middle, dystrophin protein having a shorter amino acid sequence than normal dystrophin protein or a partial amino acid substitution, is expressed.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">As the mutation of the dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy, deletion of a single or a plurality of exons occupies a half or more of the<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> mutation. Particularly, the site where a lot of deletions are found is known to be present between exon 44 and exon 55. Depending on the site of defective exon in a dystrophin gene, and for example, by referring to previously reported papers (e.g.,<nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text> van Deutekom JC, van Ommen GJ., Nat Rev Genet. 2003</text></nplcit>), if can be confirmed which exon(s) should be skipped in order to express a repaired dystrophin. As a method for expressing dystrophin by correcting a gene mutation by genome editing other than exon skipping, a method of adjusting a reading frame by introducing a minor defect or insertion in the dystrophin gene and a method of inserting a missing exon by homologous recombination are mentioned.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">If there is an abnormality as mentioned above in a dystrophin gene, the abnormality can be corrected by any one of the following operations: (i) skipping one or two or more exons so as not to be integrated into mRNA and joining exons sandwiching the skipped site to prevent a frameshift, (ii) inserting or deleting one or two or more bases to correct a frameshift and (iii) knocking-in a missing exon. If the above(i) or (ii) is selected, dystrophin protein having a shorter or longer amino acid sequence than that of a normal dystrophin protein or having a partial amino acid substitution is produced.<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> If the above operation (ii) or (iii) is selected, normal dystrophin protein can be produced. Owing to such correction of a dystrophin gene, a disease such as muscular dystrophy can be prevented or treated.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">The nucleotide sequence of a human dystrophin gene is available from, for example, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1756).</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">The repaired dystrophin protein refers to dystrophin protein the expression of which is restored as a result of genome editing; in particular, refers to dystrophin protein having a N-terminal actin binding domain and a C-terminal high-cysteine domain, the expression of which is restored by applying genome editing to a dystrophin gene having a frameshift mutation or a nonsense mutation. In the case where a frameshift mutation occurs due to duplication of exons, if one of the two exons is skipped by genome editing, the expression of the repaired dystrophin protein having 100%-homology to a normal dystrophin protein may be sometimes restored. The repaired dystrophin protein particularly refers to human dystrophin protein translated from mRNA that is obtained by skipping exon 45 from a<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> human dystrophin gene having a deletion of exon 44 and joining exon 43 and exon 46. Other than this, examples of the repaired dystrophin protein include, but are not limited to, dystrophin proteins produced by skipping a predetermined exon(s) in a human dystrophin gene having a deletion of, for example, exons 12-44, 18-44, 46-47, 46-48, 46-49, 46-51, 46-53, or 46-55. Whether repaired dystrophin protein is produced or not can be confirmed by detecting mRNA encoding repaired dystrophin protein contained in a cell by PCR, or by determining the molecular weight of the dystrophin protein based on western blotting using an antibody recognizing dystrophin protein.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a target sequence is a base sequence of a locus containing a myostatin gene. More specifically, the target sequence is a base sequence whose modification (deletion or insertion) induces a frameshift mutation or a nonsense mutation of the myostatin gene, with the result that the function of the myostatin protein is terminated or reduced, inducing muscle hypertrophy.</p>

<p id="p0137" num="0137">RNA guided nuclease may be Cas nuclease or Cas nickase. The Cas nuclease or Cas nickase herein refers to an essential protein component in the CRISPR/Cas system and means an endonuclease or a nickase exerting an activity when it forms a complex with two types of RNAs called CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivated crRNA (tracrRNA). The nickase refers to a DNA cleavage enzyme producing a nick only one of DNA strands. Generally, the Cas9 protein contains at least two nuclease<!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --> (i.e., DNase) domains For example, the Cas9 protein contains RuvC-like nuclease domain and HNH-like nuclease domain. RuvC and HNH domains work together to produce a single strand break in order to produce double-stranded breaks in DNA (<nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="s"><text>Jinek et al., Science, 337: 816-821</text></nplcit>). In an aspect, a Cas9-derived protein may be modified so as to contain only one functional nuclease domain (RuvC-like or HNH-like nuclease domain). For example, a Cas9-derived protein may be modified by deletion or mutation such that one of the nuclease domains is no longer functional (i.e., nuclease activity is not present). In an aspect where one of the nuclease domains is inactive, the Cas9-derived protein can produce a nick in a double-stranded nucleic acid; however, the protein cannot cut the double-stranded nucleic acid (DNA). For example, in the RuvC-like domain, if aspartic acid is changed to alanine (D10A), a Cas9-derived protein is changed to a nickase. Similarly, in the HNH domain, if histidine is changed to alanine (H840A or H839A), a Cas9-derived protein is changed to a nickase. Each of the nuclease domains may be modified by site-specific mutagenesis, PCR mediated mutagenesis, whole gene synthesis and another method known in the technical field.</p>

<p id="p0169" num="0169">EGFP-SSA assay: an abbreviation of EGFP-single strand annealing assay. The reporter cassette shown in <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is inserted in EGFP reporter cells. In the middle of the EGFP sequence of the cassette, MmDMD-Ex51 sequence is inserted. Since the presence of MmDMD-Ex51 sequence, by which EGFP ORF is divided, EGFP protein is not usually translated. However, when target sequence of MmDMD-Ex51 is cleaved by Cas9 protein/gRNA complex, the upstream region (EG part) and the downstream region (FP part) of EGFP ORF are annealed via a homology area into a single strand, with the result that a full-length EGFP ORF emerges to produce EGFP protein. Based on this principle, the ratio of the number of cells producing EGFP is checked by the EGFP-SSA assay. In this manner, the amount of Cas9 protein/gRNA complex delivered to cells can be predicted.<!-- EPO <DP n="92"> --></p>

<p id="p0192" num="0192">A knock-in vector (10 µg), which consists of a sequence (1.5 kb) including human DMD exon 45, a 5' side region (0.7 kb) and a 3' side region (0.6 kb), a neomycin resistance gene expression unit sandwiched by FRT sequences, and sequences derived from mouse Dmd intron 44 and intron 45 (each having 1.5 kb in size), was electroporated into 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> ES cells derived from a C57BL/6J mouse, together with a pCAG-Cas9 expression vector (2.5 µg) and two types of pU6-sgRNA expression vectors (target sequence; SEQ ID No. 7 and SEQ ID No. 8) (2.5 µg). A homologous recombination cell line was selected based on PCR and<!-- EPO <DP n="107"> --> sequence confirmation. After the neomycin resistance unit was removed by a treatment with flippase (Flpe), the ES cell line was injected into a tetraploid blastocyst of ICR mouse under the microscope to obtain a chimeric mouse. The chimeric mouse and a female C57BL/6J mouse were subjected to <i>in vitro</i> fertilization to obtain a female human DMD exon 45 hetero knock-in mouse. Subsequently, to a fertilized egg between a male C57BL/6J mouse and a female human DMD exon 45 hetero knock-in mouse, a 100 ng/µL Cas9 mRNA (TriLink BioTechnologies), two types of sgRNAs (target sequence; SEQ ID No. 9 and SEQ ID No. 10, FASMAC) for knocking out mouse Dmd exon 44, and ssODN (50 ng/µL) (SEQ ID No. 11, Eurofins Genomics K.K.) were injected under the microscope. A gene of the male offspring thus obtained was subjected to genetic determination by PCR and sequence confirmation to select a human DMD exon 45 knock-in /mouse Dmd exon 44 knock-out mouse.</p>

After the tissue was crushed and chloroform (WAKO) was added, the tissue was stirred/centrifuged, and then, a water phase containing RNA was separated and collected. Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific. Inc). Subsequently, a product with skipping was quantitatively measured by use of FastStart Universal Probe Master (Roche), the primers represented by SEQ ID Nos. 14 and 15 and the probe of sequence 16. The product without skipping was quantitatively measured by use of FastStart Universal Probe Master (Roche), the primers represented by SEQ ID Nos. 17 and 18 and the probe of sequence 19. Each of the PCR products was measured by use of ViiA7™ real time PCR system. In each amplification process, a standard product known in concentration was simultaneously amplified in order to calculate the absolute amount. For calculation, the software attached was used. Using the numerical value obtained by calculation, exon skipping efficiency was obtained in accordance with the following formula (Expression 2).</p>

EGFP reporter cells were seeded in the wells of a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well. On the following day, reaction<!-- EPO <DP n="117"> --> solution 2 (50 µL) was added. Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 30 minutes in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In other wells, iTOP-1250 (50 µL) was added and incubation was carried out in the same manner. Subsequent operations were carried out in accordance with the EGFP-SSA assay. In a preparation, the compound stock solutions were diluted with UltraPure DNase/RNase-Free Distilled Water so as to obtain the final concentrations shown in Table 2. In each plate, wells containing 250 mM GABA and wells for a solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O) alone (not containing a compound) were prepared. The relative ratio of the number of HOECHST cells detected and the EGFP positive cell rate to those of GABA per compound were calculated in accordance with the formulas (1) and (2) respectively. Calculation was carried out by using the data of three wells in a same plate and an average value thereof was plotted on a graph shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 6</figref>, in which an error bar represents a standard deviation. Bar charts represented by the names of compounds show the results of cells when reaction solution 2 was used for treatment. Since the ratio of the EGFP positive rate of a positive control to that of a negative control was 2 or more, it was determined that the experiment was successfully carried out. "Untreated" in the graph represents a well containing no Cas9/gRNA and only washed with PBS. Example of a compound exhibiting an EGFP positive rate that was 1.2 times or more<!-- EPO <DP n="118"> --> higher than iTOP-1250 include N-carbamyl-L-aspartic acid, sodium 3-methyl-2-sodium oxobutate, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, disodium argininosuccinate hydrate, 2'-deoxycytidine, inosine 5'-disodium phosphate hydrate, 1-deoxynojirimycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate, L-carnosine, α-D-glucose- 1-phosphate, creatinine, (R)-pantolactone, trimethadione and 6-phospho-D-gluconic acid.</p>

The concentrations of ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>) of inorganic salts serving as an electrolyte and contained in reaction solutions were expressed by milli equivalents (mEq/L). In all cases of salts, as the electrolytic ion concentration increases, EGFP positive rates increases. The case exhibiting the highest activity employed a mixture of three types of salts: sodium chloride, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride, and the activity of this case is high compared to the case of iTOP-1250. When sodium chloride and magnesium chloride were compared at the same electrolytic ion concentration, they exhibited almost the same activity.</p>
