<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to compounds having activity as inhibitors of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), such as eIF4AI and eIF4AII, as well as to related compositions and methods for utilizing the inventive compounds as therapeutic agents for treatment of eIF4A dependent diseases, including the treatment of cancer.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Translation is the process where the sequence of an mRNA directs the synthesis of a specific protein. The translation of most cellular mRNA, and especially those that contain highly structured 5'-UTRs or an IRES element, depends on the formation of a functional eIF4F (eukaryotic initiation factor 4F) complex consisting of eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>A. Marintchev et al., Cell, 2009; 136, 447-460</text></nplcit>. These eIF4 proteins are involved in the initiation phase of translation and help catalyze the recruitment of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 48S initiation complex. eIF4F recognizes the cap structure at the 5'-end of mRNA through eIF4E, unwinds the secondary structure of the 5'-UTR region through the helicase activity of eIF4A, and binds the 43S complex through interactions between eIF4G and eIF3. <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>A. Parsyan et al., Nature Reviews, Molecular Cell Biology, 2011; 12, 235-245</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The translation initiation factor eIF4A is a member of the "DEAD box" family of ATP-dependent helicases that acts as an RNA dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase to facilitate mRNA binding to the ribosome as part of the eIF4F complex. eIF4A consists of two distinct domains connected through a short linker that are both required for function. The enzymatic activity of eIF4A is stimulated by formation of a stable complex with eIF4G. The helicase activity of eIF4A either alone or as part of the eIF4F complex is increased through a transient interaction with eIF4B. eIF4A exists as a free form (eIF4A<sub>f</sub>) and as a subunit of eIF4F (eIF4A<sub>c</sub>) and is thought to cycle through the eIF4F complex during initiation. When bound in the eIF4F complex, eIF4A<sub>c</sub> is ∼20-fold more efficient as an RNA helicase than when found alone,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> leading to the proposal that eIF4A<sub>c</sub> is the functional helicase for translation initiation. The helicase activity of eIF4F (via eIF4A<sub>c</sub>) is thought to unwind local secondary structure in the 5'UTR of mRNAs to facilitate cap-dependent ribosome recruitment. See, e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>U. Harms et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2014; 1-12</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>A. Andreou et al., RNA Biology, 2013; 10, 19-32</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">There are three eIF4A family members: eIF4AI, eIF4AII, and eIF4AIII. eIF4AI and eIF4AII show 90-95% similarity at the amino acid level, are involved in translation and are essential for growth and development. In addition to its role in translation initiation, isoform eIF4AII also has been implicated in microRNA mediated mRNA silencing. eIF4AIII is 65% similar to the other two isoforms and is involved in nonsense-mediated decay. All three eIF4A isoforms are members of the DEAD-box putative RNA helicase protein family that are characterized by seven highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs implicated in RNA remodeling. These proteins are involved in virtually all aspects of cellular RNA metabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, splicing, translation, and mRNA degradation.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">eIF4A selectively regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs. This selectivity is a result of structural elements and sequence recognition motifs found within the 5'-UTR of the mRNA. Translation inhibition can also be regulated by the tumor suppressor programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). PDCD4 is a negative regulator of translation that binds and sequesters eIF4A. The association of PDCD4 with eIF4A induces a conformational change that prevents eIF4G from binding with eIF4A inhibiting translation initiation. <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>C. Suzuki et al., PNAS, 2008; 105, 3274-3279</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Regulation of translation is an increasingly important field as it has implications in a range of diseases. Translation initiation is rate limiting and is dependent on the eukaryotic initiation factors. Alterations in the expression of eIF4A or factors (i.e. eIF4E, eIF4B and PDCD4) that alter its activity have been observed in many cancers. eIF4E is a well-established oncogene that regulates the translation of oncogenic mRNAs with long or structured 5'-UTRs. Overexpression of eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4B has been associated with poor prognosis in disease indications including lymphoma, lung, colon, liver, ovarian and breast cancer. Decreased expression of PDCD4 has been linked to the development and progression of several types of cancer including lung, colon and liver. High levels of PDCD4 have been associated with good<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> outcomes in certain types of breast cancer. See <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>M. Bhat, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2014; 14 261-278</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>A Modelska et al., Cell Death and Disease, 2015; 6, e1603</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, while advances have been made in this field there remains a significant need in the art for compounds that specifically inhibit eFI4A activity, particularly with regard to eIF4A's role in regulation of cancer pathways, as well as for associated composition and methods. The present invention fulfills this need and provides further related advantages.</p>

<li>(iv) relieving the symptoms resulting from the disease or condition, i.e., relieving pain without addressing the underlying disease or condition. As used herein, the terms "disease" and "condition" may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians. The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound of the invention or other active ingredient sufficient to provide a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in the treatment or prevention of a disease or to delay or minimize symptoms associated with a disease. Further, a therapeutically effective amount with respect to a compound of the invention means that amount<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> of therapeutic agent alone, or in combination with other therapies, that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or prevention of a disease. Used in connection with a compound of the invention, the term can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy or synergies with another therapeutic agent.</li>

<p id="p0071" num="0071">The terms "modulate", "modulation" and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function, or activity of, for example, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), such as eIF4AI and eIF4AII. "Modulation", in its various forms, is intended to encompass inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism and/or partial agonism of the activity associated with eIF4A. eIF4A inhibitors are compounds that bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to modulate eIF4A activity can be demonstrated in an enzymatic assay or a cell-based assay.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">A "patient" or subject" includes an animal, such as a human, cow, horse, sheep, lamb, pig, chicken, turkey, quail, cat, dog, mouse, rat, rabbit or guinea pig. The animal can be a mammal such as a non-primate and a primate (e.g., monkey and human). In one embodiment, a patient is a human, such as a human infant, child, adolescent or adult.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The term "prodrug" refers to a precursor of a drug, a compound which upon administration to a patient, must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. Exemplary prodrugs of compounds in accordance with Formula I are esters, acetamides, and amides.</p>

<p id="p0092" num="0092">In another embodiment the compounds according to Formula I are selected from those presented in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">The inventive compounds according to Formula I may be isotopically-labeled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of according to Formula I include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, or iodine. Illustrative of such isotopes are <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>123</sup>I, and <sup>125</sup>I, respectively. These radiolabeled compounds can be used to measure the biodistribution, tissue concentration and the kinetics of transport and excretion from biological tissues including a subject to which such a labeled compound is administered. Labeled compounds are also used to determine therapeutic effectiveness, the site or mode of action, and the binding affinity of a candidate therapeutic to a pharmacologically important target. Certain radioactive-labeled compounds according to Formula I, therefore, are useful in drug and/or tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e. <sup>14</sup>C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --></p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. <sup>2</sup>H, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from the greater metabolic stability, for example, increased <i>in vivo</i> half-life of compounds containing deuterium. Substitution of hydrogen with deuterium may reduce dose required for therapeutic effect, and hence may be preferred in a discovery or clinical setting.<br/>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>15</sup>O and <sup>13</sup>N, provides labeled analogs of the inventive compounds that are useful in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, e.g., for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds according to Formula I, can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples section as set out below using an appropriate isotopic-labeling reagent.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are also meant to encompass the <i>in vivo</i> metabolic products of compounds according to Formula I. Such products may result from, for example, the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, and like processes primarily due to enzymatic activity upon administration of a compound of the invention. Accordingly, the invention includes compounds that are produced as by-products of enzymatic or non-enzymatic activity on an inventive compound following the administration of such a compound to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product. Metabolic products, particularly pharmaceutically active metabolites are typically identified by administering a radiolabeled compound of the invention in a detectable dose to a subject, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or human, for a sufficient period of time during which metabolism occurs, and isolating the metabolic products from urine, blood or other biological samples that are obtained from the subject receiving the radiolabeled compound.</p>

<p id="p1281" num="1281">Human tumor cell lines were cultured in the appropriate media (DMEM and RPMI) supplemented with penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> maintained at 37°C. Exponentially growing cells were seeded at 2,500 cells/well in 96 well plates prior to drug treatment. The following day, cells were treated with either DMSO (vehicle control) or eIF4A inhibitors at the appropriate dose for 72 hours at 37°C. Following compound treatment, cell proliferation was assessed by CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Dose-response curves were fitted by non-linear regression (sigmoidal dose response model) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading PA) and IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated.</p>
<p id="p1282" num="1282">The results of these assays with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells are set forth in Table 2 below. To this end, IC<sub>50</sub> values of less than 100 nM are labelled as "+++", from 100 nM to 1000 nM are labelled as "++", and greater than 1000 nM are labelled as "+" (NA means "not available").
