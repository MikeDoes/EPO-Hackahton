<heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of Related Art</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are self-emission devices that have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, and excellent characteristics in terms of brightness, driving voltage, and response speed, as compared to other devices in the art.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">OLEDs may include a first electrode on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode sequentially stacked on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transit (e.g., transition or relax) from an excited state to a ground state to thereby generate light.</p>
