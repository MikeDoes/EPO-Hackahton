The practical limit to optical or RF signals is due to the electrical and building codes prohibiting an introduction of low voltage copper lines between or into a wall box including support box mixed with AC live or neutral lines or wires.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">The POF or silica fiber cable is a fire retardant and a perfect insulator that is permitted to be mixed and mingled with AC power wires to and from wall boxes between any given AC appliance and AC source. The disclosed intelligent boxes are linked in a cascaded chain or directly linked to a controller via POF or optical fiber cable. The preferred connection is via each end of a POF being terminated by a sharp cut, using POF guillotine cutter.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The terminated end of POF is attached to an optoport by push-in action, disclosed to be locked into the optoport by locking a screw. Alternatively, the cut end (terminated end) can be locked by a simple push-in via structured lock element with no supporting tools. The solution of which makes all the element of the intelligent box(s) to be plugged-in, be it the electrical wires, the POF and the plugged-in devices, including AC operated and AC powered devices, such as loT, that cover different functions and specification.

The introduction of loT and Ai devices into the interior electrical grid is another major object of the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">There are different communicating loTs and Ai to consider and to provide for communicating data and commands via different signals such as RF, via given antenna, IR via IR transceiver (transmitter or transceiver), and optical via an optoport disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0034" dnum="US9219358B"><text>US pat. 9,219,358</text></patcit>, which is communicating at a lower speed for operating electrical appliances and reporting power consumption.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">loT, Ai and other devices call for higher speed optical signal communication for one of communicating data with other intelligent devices (loTs and/or Ai devices), and/or both communicating the referred to lower speed and/or higher speed via same optoports, or via separate two optical grids. Each individual cascading grid, comprising terminated POF segments (cuts), with each cut is directed to propagate its signals via "four way" optoports. The "four way" lower speed or the higher speed or both are provided for propagating commands and responses to and from electrical devices between appliances and a controller communicating a short protocols and commands at a lower speed.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The expansion of the communication to higher speed is to provide the loT and Ai devices with higher speed circuits operating the artificial intelligence devices (or a given appliance) that communicates data and/or mixed data and protocols. Thus, the providing of higher speed for data propagation is essential.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">The low or high speed cascaded optoport require each optoport to comprise dual optical transceivers each for two way communication, i.e., receive or transmit in two direction, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> respond to command or data, or propagate the command or data to the next optoport of the next cascading intelligent box in the cascading chain, be it for lower speed, higher speed or combined.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">The single cascading optoport operating in a two direction, each of the two way is in fact a joint crossing point of dual two way or "four way" junction to optical signals, such as receive command, respond, transmit the command to the next (cascading segment) and await for a response and re-propagate the response to complete the four way exchange.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">The propagation of optical signals can be therefore viewed as actual four ways. The repeated responding to the initial transmission are a reverse propagation in each direction, this random reversing magnifies the incidences of signals collision that is reduced substantially with the lower speed signals by detecting on going propagated signal activity, detected by the receiving element of the optoport transceiver.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">The lower speed signals, such as the use of short protocols with five byte, as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0035" dnum="US8170722B"><text>US Pat. 8,170,722</text></patcit> referred to above, to the lower speed, such as below 1K bit per second, can be detected by the opto transistor used in the opto transceiver disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0036" dnum="US8340527B"><text>US Pat.8,340,527</text></patcit>. A detection duration of 0.5mSec., as an example, provides sufficient time for the blocking or preventing the opto transmitter of the optoport from transmitting.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">For higher speed signals the detecting and processing time may be insufficient to prevent collision, and moreover, for higher speed optical signals such as 100K bit and above the use of photo transistors is not recommended. The photo transistor processing speed is slower and the photo transistor amplification is non linear, introducing speed limits. For higher speed the use of photo diode or optodiode is preferred.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">On the other hand, the photo transistor provide self amplification, but signals detected by opto diode need to be amplified, timed and shaped by added circuits which are costly. Further, the multi<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> processing represents a time delay in the sensing of light or propagated activity of signals via the cascaded POF and therefore cannot be effective to ensure no collision.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The cascaded chain of POF cuts for higher speed communication is yet another object of the present invention, including a newly devised optoport comprising direct optical access to optical elements of a transmitter, a receiver including a signal sensor for sensing optical signal presence and a circuit for controlling the transmission start time.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The newly introduced optoport elements and circuits substantially upgrading the intelligence capabilities of an intelligent loT and Ai boxes of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The introduction of higher speed optical grid into the intelligent support boxes of an electrical grid of a given premises, introduces higher speed grids, cascading between group of boxes. The installing of such higher performance grid cannot be completed without the grid being tested and verified to be performing as designed, or be tested and adjusted/corrected to perform as designed.</p>

This considering that many installers of electrical devices are not fiber optic communication installer, or are knowledgeable in optical signal propagation. Such state mandates an introduction of varying testers, covering the whole range of testing in the practical need for the cascading lines and the grid performances.</p>

<p id="p0123" num="0123"><figref idref="f0009">Fig. 9A</figref> shows the glass decorative cover 143 as used with the support box 103 (any type or version thereof). The cover 143 shown to include two different serrated lock bars, four shorter bars 141A aligned with lock structures 13A are used mainly for small support box, such as 102 of <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">The reason for using the shorter serrated bars with the lock receptacles 13A is the need to have the serrated lock bars at the four corners of the decorative cover. In the example shown, the support frame of the support boxes 103 and 106 or larger support boxes, a firm locking can be provided with no reliance on the four corners by the shown longer serrated bar 141 or 181. The 141 and 181 serrated bars ensure proper lock onto the wall surface surrounding the support frame for all the support boxes sizes.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">Important reason is that the receptacles 13A are located at the two ends of the support frame, in a position outside the support frame inner open cavity, i.e., the receptacles 13A may be positioned in a space against the cemented wall, and cannot accommodate longer serrated bars, such as the longer serrated bars 141 or 181 shown in <figref idref="f0009">Figs. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">The serrated bars 141 or 181 are inserted into a receptacles 13 inside the support frame inner open cavity. The serrated bars 141A and 181A are shorter to prevent an impossible insertion, wherein the bars 141A/181A are blocked by the cemented wall and cannot be pushed all the way to be flat with the wall.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">Further, as explained and detailed below, the insertion of the locking serrated bars 141 into the lock 13 provide for stronger pressure onto the bending lock arm 18 that firmly lock the lock ramps 26 or 36 and further lock the decorative frame onto the wall surface via more than four serrated bars such as the six bars 181 shown in <figref idref="f0009">Fig.9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">Accordingly it is a question of design choice to introduce n plurality of serrated bars into the different boxes be it only 141A or 141, or combinations thereof, or only 181 or 181A or both.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">The enlarged cut view show the lock of the serrated bar 141 locked by a sharp bulge 13 at the top rear edge of the bending lock arm 18. The bulge 13 and the serrated bar are structured for the decorative frame to be firmly locked as it rests flat on the wall surface surrounding the support frame.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">The decorative frame, be it 143 or 183 or any other locked decorative support frame size, can be removed from the wall by a firm pull by an installer or the user hands (with no tools).</p>

<p id="p0157" num="0157">The access 67 is supported by a lock element 67K shown in <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12D</figref>, structured into the access, that is released by pushing a release pin 67P into a release opening 67A as shown in <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12D</figref> being held by fingers, prior to inserting the POF 69-2 held by given fingers of the other hand.</p>
<p id="p0158" num="0158">The POF should not be entered or released into and from the access without pushing the release pin simultaneously with the insertion all the way to ensure physical attachment of the cut end onto the optical transceiver surface. The withdrawal of the release pin 67P from the release opening 67A causes the lock structure to lock the POF into place, i.e., disables the pull out of the POF cut end from engaging the access 67.</p>
<p id="p0159" num="0159">Alternatively, a lock screw head can be used for locking the cut POF end as shown in the prior art of <figref idref="f0001">Fig.1C</figref> showing a lock mechanism by tightening a screw head upon the insertion of the cut POF cable, or release the screw head locking the access of the cut (terminated) POF.</p>

<p id="p0161" num="0161">Further, the plug-in optical devices 80, 81, 82 and 84T are shown to include terminal 55 and/or 56 for connecting electrical signals and power feed to the shown low voltage devices. Some of the low voltage devices include regulator for regulating the DC power, such as the power fed to the CPU and the optoports via well known DC voltage regulator 87R, shown in <figref idref="f0017">Fig.17A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">The front and rear sides of the optical device 80 of <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12A</figref> show two different set-up, wherein the front view illustrates optical cables 69 at both sides, the front via access 67 and the rear view of the optical device 80 illustrates a selective access 67 or 68.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">This is important for the understanding the many options and variations provided by the combinations of the POF and the optoports. As the loT's and Ai's are yet to be massively introduced, the issues involving such introduction into the smart home or automated home or whatever term is given to the anticipated advanced ideas and electronics into residences and/or businesses, the main difficulties such new devices pose is how to link them to the electrical grid of a home or an office or a restaurant or a shop.</p>
<p id="p0164" num="0164">The above is due to the prohibition to connect low voltage copper lines (wires) to AC wall boxes or mingled with AC wires.</p>
<p id="p0165" num="0165">The signaling at present time for home automation and to very limited appliances that are RF (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UHF and other allowable frequencies), some of which include a "traffic" control programming of signal based on carrier frequency and/or modulation etc., but do not provide, at or as of current time, practical means to communicate with the internal electrical grid and its elements as used in buildings, and cannot deny or block wireless "trafficking" from neighboring apartments, houses or buildings.<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --></p>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">The inability to prevent collision transforms the propagated RF signal to a non reliable means for communicating in a crowded environment (many electrical devices and elements) within a confine of an apartment or a house, office, or other business unit. The RF will be discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">The "bulky" or a large loT or Ai device referred to above, is a reference to an outer size or dimension of an IoT or Ai devices. Such large IoT or Ai device may, for example, need to be placed on a shelf or be structured into an enclosure in a shape of a framed art work (not shown) hanged on a wall, to camouflage an Ai device to be a framed painting. Such device will over cover the support box and its decorative cover.</p>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">The larger device need to be <u>linked and powered</u> via at least one plug-in device discussed later below. The need to link optically via terminated cut POF is provided via, as an example, the optical accessing device 80 of <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12A</figref>. Hence the need to provide at least one optical access to a cut (terminated) POF via the plug-in device top cover, shown to be provided in the devices 80 or 81 of <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12A</figref>, can be a physical guide for inserting all the way to an access 68 shown in boxes 104-2-OP or 906-M of <figref idref="f0012">Figs.12C-12D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">Such device with at least one access shown as 80, 81, 82 and 84 or 84T can be used for such purpose. The device 84T is shown with the cover 84P removed, revealing four accesses 67A each with the release opening 67B, same as shown in <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12D</figref> discussed above.</p>

The POF is entered into the shown access 67A and locked by the release pin 67P as explained above. In fact shown four (or more) POF cables can be introduced through the front cover 84P of the plug-in device 84, two are shown in the plug-in device 82 or all may be reduced to one only POF terminated by cut.<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --></p>

<p id="p0172" num="0172">With the one and up to four, or more (not shown), the linking of the four (or more) POF cut are attached and locked to the inner cover 84C. The process is complete by attaching the top cover 84P of the enclosure, using its mechanical lock bars 84A and the bar receptacles 84B for locking the top cover by a push-in of the cover onto the enclosure to complete the POF connections between the larger or bulky loT or Ai device to the "standard plug-in optical device" 84, or 82 or 81 which can be structured the same way, with the exception of the number of optical accesses.</p>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">The "standard plug-in optical device" can be further structured in at least two ways, one is for providing optical link via (for example) dual optical accesses 68, one at the rear surface of the optical plug-in device and the other at the front surface of the support box be it 102-112 or 902-912 box, having their transceiver optical surface aligned with the physical surface of both the support box and the rear of the "standard plug-in optical device" and with both are positioned to face the other optoport 68 directly, to provide direct linkage between each receiver and each emitting transmitter, in a perfect alignment, improving substantially the communication flow.</p>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">The circuit and the power feed for the plug-in optical devices with the optoports 68 are connected via the terminals 65 and 66 respectively. The signal terminals 65 and the power terminals 66 are either connected to the elements of the circuits of the box 903nT including the DC power feed via the terminals DCo,<sup>+</sup> and DCo,-, but can also be separately fed by a solid wire 65B (such as AWG24 as used in a solid twist pair), to be inserted by a push into the push-in receptacle 66A. Same apply to the identical signal wire 65B inserted by push in to the receptacles 65A, shown in <figref idref="f0012">Fig.12D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">The other optical link between the standard plug-in optical device and the support box 902-912 is, for example, via the optical device 84T shown with its top cover 84A removed provided with push-in<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> terminals 65 and/or 66 (not shown) for feeding DC power and connecting signals between the loT or the Ai device and the support box, such that the plugged in optical device 84T including a built-in insulated DC power supply for DC power feed to, as an example, the large framed artwork Ai device referred to above.</p>
<p id="p0176" num="0176">It is further possible to use the optical device 84T as a junction connecter for both the optical via n optical accesses at the surface of the plug-in support box and via the push-in terminal, in many combinations, in which different circuits can be introduced into a given "plug-in optical module", for connecting "specific" or "customed" or "selected from a group" of "plug-in optical modules" for connecting different loT's and/or Ai on the basis of differing functions, speed, structure and usage.</p>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">Moreover, the shown intelligent support box 103-2 of <figref idref="f0004">Fig.4A</figref> and the AC outlet 211 (US) of <figref idref="f0004">Fig.4B</figref> show the direct optical accesses 38-OP to be engaged with the AC plug 211P optical access by plugging the AC plug 211P into the AC outlet 211. This enables the circuits referred to the "standard plug-in optical module" be incorporated into an AC outlets or an AC plug for the most simple plug-in solution for a portable or movable loT and/or Ai device, that is not installed into or onto a wall.</p>

<p id="p0179" num="0179">From the above explanation, it should be clear that the use of the "standard plug-in optical devices" introduces a whole new concept and practical solutions for propagating and trafficking optical signals, using any optical cables such as fiber optic cable or plastic optical fiber having different core diameter, including a preferred 1mm diameter core size of the POF cable that offer a perfect solution for optical communications, covering the whole of smart home's devices communications in a cascaded optical linking, within a confine of an apartment, office, shop, restaurant and other business units.<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --></p>

<p id="p0253" num="0253">This mandates the introduction of trans-impedance or operational amplifiers 86C (op-amp.) to convert and amplify the signal into a detectable-manageable signal by a CPU, such as 87P.</p>
<p id="p0254" num="0254">The signal output of the receiver 68PD-2 however further needs to be processed, shaped and compared with an original propagated data signals to ensure that no error readings of data will occur. This can be tested, verified or calibrated by an optical signal tester/calibrator shown in <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16</figref> that is disclosed further below.</p>
<p id="p0255" num="0255">The receiving circuit of the receiver 68PD-2 further includes pulse shaper 86D that feed a clean shaped received signal to the I/O R2 of the CPU 87P and further connect via a "level set" line to the I/O T2 for adjusting the signal level by the CPU, as set by the tester/calibrator 810 of <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16B</figref> to be discussed further below.<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --></p>
<p id="p0256" num="0256">The other receiver 68PD-1 of <figref idref="f0014">Fig.14B</figref> includes the op-amp or trans-impedance amplifier 86A of <figref idref="f0014">Fig.14B</figref> for amplifying a detected signal at random for preventing signal collision. This mandates the following explanation.</p>
<p id="p0257" num="0257">Signal collision is defined as signal at opposing ends of a communication line collide before reaching their destination at the end of the line, at either end.</p>
<p id="p0258" num="0258">The "academic" limit for collision prevention via copper wire that propagate the electric signal at approximate speed of or at about half the light speed C (C÷2) is 100 meter. The "academic" length of optical fiber cable propagating optical signal speed at about 70% of light signal is about 70m.</p>
<p id="p0259" num="0259">Accordingly, on the basis of the academic or the rule of a thumb, the signal speed in copper wire (twist pair) is 0.4-0.7 of the light speed of 300,000,000m, i.e., ranges from 4.7nSec./m to 8.3nSec./m or 0.47-0.83µSec. per 100m.</p>
<p id="p0260" num="0260">The fiber rule of thumb is 200,000,000m/Sec., but it is slower for thicker core, such as the POF. With that said the signal propagation speed via POF is safely considered to be 0.5µSec./100m. If we limit the cable length to 50m only, the max delay of signal sensing at the other end of the POF cable will be 0.25µSec. or 250nSec.</p>
<p id="p0261" num="0261">The propagation physics impose limitation to communicating optical signal via the cascaded POF segment chain that need to be re-visited, to better understand the issues involved.
<ol id="ol0001" ol-style="">
<li>i. The POF communication segment links <u>two adjacent optoports only</u>.</li>
<li>ii. Each optoport connects its receivers and transmitter via the CPU 87P, <u>not via another optical elements of the access</u>. This makes the collision issues a strict issue of signal collision of a stand alone single POF stretch of 50 meter long (max), linking directly via its two terminated ends to two photo/opto accesses or ports.<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --></li>
<li>iii. The line can transmit from one optoport to a second optoport or reversely transmit from second optoport to the one optoport, and must be prevented from two way simultaneous transmission through the single segmented POF.</li>
<li>iv. Both optoports receiving circuits are connected to and are ready to receive and communicate via the explained above circuit, at all times, with a reference to a dual or two I/O ports of the CPU 87P, making the dual CPU's and the two optoports (the two accesses) on both ends of the POF segment to be the elements involved in denying transmission to avoid collisions.</li>
<li>v. As the only link between the two adjacent accesses 67 is a <u>single</u> POF cable segment, <u>self denial</u> or self <u>blocking of a transmission at any one end of the POF</u>, by one of CPU's involved is the most effective method (within the shortest disruption time duration).</li>
<li>vi. Any "request for transmission permission" will take far longer than self denial, as request and approval mandates two way protocols.</li>
<li>vii. The only practical issue may arise if the two adjacent support boxes intend to transact data or protocol signals as received from the next adjacent junction in the cascade at the <u>same time</u> (in micro or milli seconds coincidence), prior to the I/O ports of the CPU 87P receive the processed communication (command or response or power consumption reporting).</li>
<li>viii. The conclusion of such delay (in a choice of time and signal speed) represent a choice or choices, depending on practical anticipated performances in communicating data and/or command protocols, including responses versus the issues of costs as disclosed above.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0262" num="0262">It is important to note that CPU is or will be "aware" of the on-going through it, and if the two receiving I/O ports of the same junction are receiving possible colliding signals from the two adjacent junctions, the CPU can block both received signals instantly.<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --></p>
<p id="p0263" num="0263">The practical realities are that <u>a segment</u> of cascaded line combined into the electrical ducts, pipes and network inside a confined premises, is rarely beyond 30m (100ft.) and an high speed signal such as 500kbit (or 500kHz) is well above the practical need for internal communication between electrical and loT's or Ai devices. Higher needs for such communication set-up can be provided at low cost RF circuits and antennas, such as for Wi-Fi communication via routers and the internet.</p>
<p id="p0264" num="0264">The solution considering of all the above, is to provide practical signal speed of 100kbit (100kHz), enabling the use of a practical medium cost high speed photo diode 68PD, and single op-amp, AGC or trans-impedance amplifier 86C or other sensitive linear amplifier, referred to in the disclosure and the claims as the "receiving elements, to feed the incoming signal to both the pulse shaper 86D and the mono stable circuit 86B, for triggering a self delay time pulse, to block the intended transmit protocol or data by the adjacent CPU, "well" prior to propagating the first byte of the five bytes are sent. The well prior can last from micro sec. to milli sec. time units.</p>
<p id="p0265" num="0265">When no signal is detected followed by a "programmed re-verify duration and/or the suspend pulse" propagated (for example 5 mSec. delay) is received via the optical transceivers 68L, through the POF by the adjacent receiving junction. The suspend pulse prevents any intended transmission thereby preventing a collision.</p>
<p id="p0266" num="0266">The prevention concept can be summarized as; "first to transmit the suspend pulse is the one to continue with the transmission when the pulse is over". To further summarize, the system is programmed to operate on the basis of "first to intent will be first to transmit", and will proceed with the transmit process when the suspend pulse and the verifying duration is over.</p>
<p id="p0267" num="0267">The other end of the POF segment, i.e., of the adjacent junction that also intend to transmit will generate, for example, five milli sec. pulse at the end of the transmitted protocol or data stream, and will follow with the intended transmission, thereby preventing a collision.<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --></p>
<p id="p0268" num="0268">To avoid error in detecting the end of the transmission the CPU is programmed for a time duration verification that no further signal is propagated, based on which the adjacent junction can proceed with its intend to transmit pulse.</p>
<p id="p0269" num="0269">In other words, the transmitting access generates a short delay pulse of, for example, 5 mSec. commanding the receiving access (that may "intend to transmit") to transmit only after the transmission of a command (or data) is completed.</p>
<p id="p0270" num="0270">Such introduction of a short delay time into a given segment of a cascade line is novel, yet it sets a constant delay time, of for example n units of nano, micro or milli sec. delay, which duration is in fact, an insignificant for internal communication between cascaded devices of a given optical grid, linked to an electrical power grid including smart or intelligent home devices, such as future loTs and/or Ai devices for controlling and operating home automation elements via an home automation grid.</p>
<p id="p0271" num="0271">The choice to provide the optical access with one only photo diode or two or more is a question of costs. If the choice is to further propagate higher speed signals, for example 10M bit or 10MHz, where any delay become meaningful, the use of a very fast photo diode and circuits, such as 500MHz trans-impedance amp. and comparator, as well as high linear and high accuracy signal shaper and fast processing mono stable devices, or use a high speed CPU for such purposes. But the circuits to provide a communication speed of 10MHz (as an example) between standard plug-in devices in peer to peer Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is practical, and such RF circuits and antennas shown in <figref idref="f0017">Fig.17A</figref> can be used.</p>

<p id="p0334" num="0334">A major obstacle at present times to the proliferation of loT's and Ai's is the inability to connect and link such devices to the electrical grids of an occupied residence and business premises.

It should be clear that the loose electric wires and the POF cable and the grid OPGL shown in the two wall boxes 503-3/4 (blank) boxes can be cut, i.e., terminated and linked into a single junction 67JL or freely into two 67 accesses (no in-out polarity or designation).</p>

<p id="p0401" num="0401">The shown reference of each test in <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16A</figref> and as listed above are the given alphabetic identifying references for selecting the test programs, as listed in the table above and referred to in the shown display screen of <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0402" num="0402">The references displayed into the touch icons of the display screen 87S, are the references included in <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16A</figref>. The actual icons however, are illustratively drawn icons (not shown) for the recall via a touch of a selected given icon for proceeding with the test program, followed by TX or RX or VM step touch icons, into the processing display area, for further indicating by color for example, the test being processes and the result of:<br/>
The test is initiated by a command transmit TX-Test followed by a command transmitted and a response (if received) R - No error or - Error or no response. When no response or "no error" is displayed, as shown in <figref idref="f0016">Fig.16A</figref> display 800T.</p>
<p id="p0403" num="0403">When the test is applied via the Higher speed, it is preferable to send a command for signal measuring and the responder 840 or any of the control devices 560, 570 and 580 will measure the received and amplified signal using the level set value via the I/O 0.73V value shown in the display 800-VM, as a gauge to the measurement and automatically increase or decrease the signal level via the level set I/O port T2 or T5 (left or right) of <figref idref="f0014">Fig.14B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0404" num="0404">If the value is in a range, such as (for example) 0.5-0.8V, the signal as measured will be recorded into the memory, and the response will be transmitted to display the measured level (for example) 0.63V followed by new level set at 0.8V (by self increasing the set level of T2 or T5 (left or right).<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --></p>
<p id="p0405" num="0405">The new value prompt a retransmission of TX Test, and a response RX No error or RX error. The adjustment of signal level is made possible by the permanently fed two way signals for the only two signal sources on both ends of the POF segment.</p>
<p id="p0406" num="0406">Moreover, as the first test is for single POF segment, it should be simple to check the terminations of the POF, or the actual attachment to the responder and to the tester itself.</p>
<p id="p0407" num="0407">The handling of an identified error mandates a directive manual "how to process a discovered error" and it is not the object of the present invention, that is an introduction of a novel tester or testers that process the testing and verification (of the transmitted commands or data), in a simplest possible process by electrical grid installers as explained above.</p>
<p id="p0408" num="0408">Similar processes are provided for all other test, via single or dual accesses or junction, be it the single grid or dual grids, wherein the test has repeated steps for each TX transmission and RX receiving, and the means to measure the signal level that is recommended, even if the response shows No error.</p>
<p id="p0409" num="0409">The items needed to be checked in regards to signal level, are, i. the length of the POF segment, ii. the termination (the cut of the POF end) and the attachment of the cut (terminated) end, of each cut end into each access in the cascade. A tight attachment in needed to reduce signal loss.</p>
<p id="p0410" num="0410">Such checking and verifying during the install and attach the POF segments, is the most effective process to ensure high reliability cascaded grids, while each test can be completed in few seconds or minutes, such as 4-5 min, at most to attach two terminated end to the tester and the responder accesses and touch the icon(s) of the tester and wait a second for a response.</p>

The differences between the four shown systems are the shown testers 810, 820 and 830 and the tests being carried by the testers in combination with the responders 840 and/or the distributor 570.</p>

<p id="p0417" num="0417">If the test fails (error or no response) the same procedure as disclosed above for error, etc., is carried out.</p>

Such responder cannot link dual junctions of both L and H optical speed signals.</p>
<p id="p0419" num="0419">However, the testing of first cascaded segment of the L and H junctions connected to the responder 840 or the tester 810 can be tested and verified by a further test between the responder 840 and the distributor.</p>

In accordance with Article 76(1) EPC, a European divisional application may be filed only in respect of subject-matter which does not extend beyond the content of the earlier application as filed.</p><p num="2">The claims of the present application are not based on the original claims of the earlier application, as filed on 04-03-2019.</p><p num="3">The present application defines a method for verifying bidirectional optical conductivity, using optical testers. The only description passages of the earlier application which appear to be potentially relevant are the description passages related to figures 16-19. These passages also disclose optical testers. However, nowhere in these passages a method for verifying bidirectional optical conductivity could be identified. Furthermore, the dependent claims define a large number of detailed steps, which appear to have no relation to the content of the earlier application.</p><p num="4">An invitation under Rule 63 EPC has been sent out in order to give the applicant the opportunity to comment on a basis and to define the subject-matter on which the search should be based on.</p><p num="5">In response thereto, the applicant has provided a letter to indicate the basis for the claims. In the letter, the applicant notes that the term "tester" is mentioned 83 times in the earlier application. Furthermore, the applicant copied excerpts from the earlier application (specifically: the A1 publication thereof), which allegedly disclose the claimed subject-matter.</p><p num="6">While the indicated passages discloses individual elements of claim 1, as for example a tester, the passages fail to disclose the subject-matter of claim 1 in a direct and unambiguous manner. Specifically, the passages do not disclose the claimed combination of features. The standard for assessing subject-matter filed under Article 76(1) EPC is the same as the one of Article 123(2) EPC (see Guidelines H-IV.2.3.2.). In accordance with this standard, the content of the application as filed must not be considered to be a reservoir from which individual features pertaining to separate embodiments can be combined in order to artificially create a particular combination (Guidelines H-V.3.2.1). This standard is not met by the claims. For example, claim 1 comprises the feature "initiating the bidirectional optical conductivity verification process by actuating the start key". This feature is nowhere to be found in the indicated passages.</p><p num="7">Furthermore, the applicant has made no recognizable effort in showing the basis for the dependent claims.</p><p num="8">Therefore, it is concluded that the application does not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC.  The search is performed in accordance with Guidelines B-VIII.6, case (c) and B-VIII.3.2.2., fourth paragraph. Even in view of the explanations provided by the applicant, the examiner is not able to deduce which embodiment (i.e. combination of features) the applicant attempted to define in the claims. The indicated passages span different embodiments.
