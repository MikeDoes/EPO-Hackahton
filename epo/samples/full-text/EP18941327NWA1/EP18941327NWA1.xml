<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacterium transformant harboring the ability to produce lactic acid, and to a method for producing lactic acid using the same.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<heading id="h0003"><u>Production of chemical products using microorganisms</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015, provides that global emissions of greenhouse gases should be promptly reduced. Under the Agreement, Japan set the goal of reducing her emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane by 26% compared with year 2013 levels, by the year 2030.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Worldwide, the majority of the production of chemicals depends on petroleum resources, exacerbating the problem of increased greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, departure from petroleum dependency is a desirable strategy for the production of chemicals, and research and development of biorefineries that produce green chemicals from biomass is being earnestly carried out in various countries. However, the saccharification of biomass for use as raw materials of microbial fermentation necessitates complex processes, beside being costly.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As part of research geared towards departure from petroleum dependency, gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide have attracted attention as more sustainable carbon sources, and techniques for producing valuable chemicals and biofuels using microorganisms that<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> utilize these gases are the subject of intense interest. In particular, carbon fixation of carbon dioxide and efficient utilization of carbon dioxide, a significant contributor to global warming, is highly anticipated.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Biodegradable plastics, which are eventually decomposed to water and carbon dioxide by microorganisms in nature, have attracted attention in light of the problems of sea pollution by plastic garbage, etc. Biodegradable plastics are categorized into bacterial products series, natural products series and chemical synthetic series according to method of manufacture. Polylactic acid (lactic acid resin), of which research and practical realization has proceeded the fastest of all biodegradable plastics, is regarded as an intermediate biodegradable plastic between bacterial products series and chemical synthetic series since its raw material is lactic acid, a product of the glycolysis system, an intravital metabolic pathway. That is, polylactic acid is produced by the purification of lactic acid produced by microbial fermentation and chemical polycondensation. Current polylactic acid production uses biomass as a raw material, the conversion of biomass into saccharides requires complicated steps, as aforementioned, and therefore, current polylactic acid production has a ploblem of a high cost.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, a practicable method which is able to produce lactic acid in simpler steps is required. In particular, a practicable method which is able to produce lactic acid by carbon dioxide fixation.</p>

<heading id="h0007">Summary of Invention</heading>
<heading id="h0008">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The objective of the present invention is to provide a transformant of a <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacterium that is capable of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> efficiently producing lactic acid utilizing carbon dioxide as a sole carbon source, and a method for efficiently producing lactic acid using this transformant.</p>
<heading id="h0009">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p0021" num="0021"><i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria are hydrogen oxidizing bacteria which grow by producing organic substances from carbon dioxide by utilizing hydrogen energy. The growth rate of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria is generally extremely slow, however, the growth rate of <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria is fast, and their carbon fixation ability of carbon dioxide is remarkably higher than that of plants and photosynthetic bacteria.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022"><i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria do not have a lactate dehydrogenase gene and a malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene, which are known to encode an enzyme catalyzing the reaction of producing lactic acid from pyrubic acid. In order to provide the bacteria with an ability to produce lactic acid at an industrial scale, there is a need to introduce genes of enzymes that catalyze the reaction of producing lactic acid.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The inventors of the present invention have found that when a heterologous gene is introduced into <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria using a vector that functions within the <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, a functioning protein often is not produced or is insufficiently produced. Genes which bring about high activity within bacteria other than the genus <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> often do not, or insufficiently, bring about activity.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Faced with such a situation, the inventors of the present invention have found that when a lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or a gene encoding a malate/lactate dehydrogenase which has lactate dehydrogenase activity is/are introduced into <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, the gene(s) function(s) and bring(s) about high activity within the <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The inventors of the present invention have also found that a transformant obtained by introducing a lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or a malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene into a <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacterium, efficiently produces lactic acid using carbon dioxide as a sole carbon source.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, the inventors of the present invention have found that ldh gene of <i>Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius, Geobacillus kaustophilus</i> or <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> of the lactate dehydrogenase genes and mldh gene of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> and mldh-1 and mldh-2 genes of <i>Meiothermus ruber</i> of the malate/lactate dehydrogenase genes bring about higher enzymatic activity expression especially in <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention has been completed based on the above-mentioned findings, and provides the following transformants and methods for producing lactic acid.

<heading id="h0010">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Measures to counter the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide entail reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and fixation of emitted carbon dioxide. In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, solar, wind, geothermal, and similar energies are utilized in place of fossil energy. However, the utilization of such energies is not yet extensive enough to repress the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Consequently, there is need to enhance atmospheric carbon fixation or recycling of emitted carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Carbon fixation of carbon dioxide can occur physically or chemically, but fixation utilizing living cells, avails organic substances that can consequently be utilized as food, feed, and fuel. In so doing, carbon dioxide itself becomes a resource that can be directly converted into valuable chemical products. Accordingly, the twin problems of global warming due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and scarcity of food, feed, and fuel can be solved. Further, in-demand chemical products can be produced while suppressing global warming attributed to increased carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Biodegradable plastics of chemical products attract attention for their environmental benefits. Biodegradable plastics produced by fixation of carbon dioxide are decomposed to water and carbon dioxide by microorganisms in the environment. That is, biodegradable plastics are carbon-neutral, and are able to solve global warming attributed to increased carbon dioxide emissions, difficulty in securing plastic products necessary for life, and environmental problems such as sea pollution, together.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria can grow by utilizing the chemical energy generated by the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen and by using carbon dioxide as a sole carbon source. Since hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria can produce chemical<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> products from a mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide gases as raw material, the cells can efficiently assimilate carbon from carbon dioxide and be cultured in a simple culture medium. Growth of typical hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria is generally slow, but that of <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria is exceptionally high. <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>The Journal of Mitsubishi Research Institute No.34 1999</text></nplcit> describes <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria as follows: "Their proliferative capacity is so high that their carbon fixation ability of carbon dioxide cannot be compared with that of plants, which truly indicates the high carbon dioxide fixation ability of microorganisms".</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">When a heterologous gene is introduced into <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria using a vector that functions within the <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, a functioning protein is often not produced. Regardless, according to the present invention, by introducing lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene into of <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, the genes functioned within the <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, and lactic acid could be produced.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">As described above, <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria have a atypically remarkable carbon fixation ability of carbon dioxide among organisms having carbon dioxide fixation ability, and therefore, by using the transformant of the present invention, carbon derived from carbon dioxide can be fixed and lactic acid can be produced at an industrial level. Since lactic acid is used as a raw material for producing polylactic acid, which is a typical biodegradable plastic, the present invention has opened the way to producing polylactic acid industrially.</p>
<heading id="h0011">Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</heading>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The present invention is described in detail below:</p>
<heading id="h0012"><u>(1) Transformant having lactic acid producing ability</u></heading>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The present invention encompasses a transformant obtained by introducing lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene into a host bacterium of <i>Hydrogenophilus.</i> In other words, this transformant possesses exogenous lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene. Malate/lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme having the activity of lactate dehydrogenase.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">Lactate dehydrogenase gene or malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene can be introduced, alternatively, lactate dehydrogenase gene and malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene can be introduced. Further, two or more kinds of lactate dehydrogenase genes and/or two or more kinds of malate/lactate dehydrogenase genes can be introduced.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037"><i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria do not produce lactic acid in an amount that can be utilized industrially. When a lactate dehydrogenase gene and/or malate/lactate dehydrogenase gene of a heterogenous microorganism is introduced into <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, the gene(s) function(s) within the <i>Hydrogenophilus</i> bacteria, and a highly active lactate dehydrogenase and/or malate/lactate dehydrogenase is/are produced, and therefore, the obtained transformants efficiently produce lactic acid using carbon dioxide as a sole carbon source.</p>
<heading id="h0013"><u>Transgene</u></heading>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Examples of the lactate dehydrogenase gene include <i>Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius</i> ldh gene, <i>Geobacillus kaustophilus</i> ldh gene and <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> ldh gene, which are preferable in that they have good lactic acid production efficiency. The base sequence of <i>Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius</i> ldh gene is SEQ ID NO: 1, the base sequence of <i>Geobacillus kaustophilus</i> ldh gene is SEQ ID NO: 2 and base sequence of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> ldh gene is SEQ ID NO: 3.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">DNA which consists of a base sequence having 90% or more, particularly 95% or more, more particularly 98% or more,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> furthermore particularly 99% or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3, the DNA encoding a polypeptide having lactate dehydrogenase activity, can also be used preferably.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In the present invention, the identities of base sequences were calculated using GENETYX ver.17 (made by GENETYX Corporation).</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">DNA which hybridizes with a DNA consisting of a base sequence complementary to SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3 under stringent conditions, the DNA encoding a polypeptide having lactate dehydrogenase activity, can also be used preferably.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the present invention, "stringent conditions" means hybridization with 6xSSC solution at temperatures from 50 to 60°C for 16 hours, followed by washing with 0.1xSSC solution.</p>
