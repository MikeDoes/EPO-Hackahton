<heading id="h0001"><u>Technical Field</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present application mainly relates to the field of underwater swimming aids, in particular to an underwater swimming aid capable of fixing a camera instrument.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>Background</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">With the rise of underwater entertainment industries, the under equipment market in China is being gradually developed. Swimming aids, as underwater propulsion equipment for assisting users in swimming in water, adopt a motor to generate power to drive blades and typically include single-thrust swimming aids, dual-thrust swimming aids and multi-thrust swimming aids. The number of thrusts principally depends on the number of propellers.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The underwater swimming aids may be applied in different forms such as handheld type, foot-wear type and backpack type. For example, regarding a dual-thrust handheld swimming aid, a connecting plate is disposed between two propellers to be held by users. During use, the users may hold the connecting plate with both hands to swim more smoothly. The foot-wear swimming aid is worn on the feet during use and can bring different entertainment experiences to users.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">However, if users want to record submarine scenes when playing under the sea with the underwater swimming aids, they have to hold a waterproof camera instrument by hand to photograph the submarine scenes in the swimming process, and thus cannot devote themselves to enjoying or photographing the scenes. When handheld underwater swimming aids are used, the life safety of users may be endangered.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><u>Summary</u></heading>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of this, the present application provides an underwater<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> swimming aid, comprising a power device and a camera instrument fixing device, wherein the power device comprises a propeller for providing propulsion power and a connecting plate fixed to the propeller; and the camera instrument fixing device comprises a mounting bracket and a fixing bracket, the mounting bracket is fixed to the connecting plate, and the fixing bracket is fixedly connected to the mounting bracket and is used for fixing a camera instrument.</p>

Actually, a single-thrust swimming aid or a multi-thrust swimming aid such as a triple-thrust swimming aid, or a backpack or foot-wear underwater swimming aid may be adopted as long as a threaded hole is formed in the additional plate to realize connection with the camera instrument fixing device to allow users to photograph underwater scenes by means of the camera instrument.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>, the camera instrument fixing device 20 comprises a mounting bracket 210, a fixing bracket 220 and a fixing shaft 230. The camera instrument fixing device 20 in this embodiment is identical in structure with the camera instrument fixing device 2 in Embodiment 1, and for the sake of brevity, only the differences therebetween will be described herein.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>, in this embodiment, the mounting bracket 210 is a vertical plate. A fourth threaded hole 2110 is formed in the bottom of the mounting bracket 210, and a third shaft hole (not shown) is formed in the top of the mounting bracket 210 and is to be connected to the fixing bracket 220 for use. Actually, the specific shape and dimension of the mounting bracket can be adjusted as actually required by the camera instrument and the connecting plate, and should not<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> be construed as limitations of this embodiment. The fourth threaded hole 2110 is to be connected to the third threaded hole 1210 for use, and the specific position and dimension of the fourth threaded hole 2110 should not be construed as limitations of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>, the fixing bracket 220 in this embodiment is identical in structure with the fixing bracket 22 in Embodiment 1, and for the sake of brevity, will no longer be described herein.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The fixing shaft 230 in this embodiment is identical in structure with the fixing shaft 23 in Embodiment 1, and for the sake of brevity, will no longer be described herein.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the third threaded hole 1210 and the fourth threaded hole 2110 are fixed together through a screw and a nut to fix the power device 10 and the camera instrument fixing device 20.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Actually, the clamping structure of the camera instrument can be in different forms, and the rotation structure of the fixing bracket 220 around the mounting bracket 210 can also be in different forms. Only simple and common ones are illustrated in this embodiment. Thus, the clamping structure of the camera instrument, more specifically the specific structure of the camera instrument fixing device, may be construed as a limitation of this embodiment as long as the camera instrument can be fixed to the additional plate 1210 and can be clamped.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Furthermore, the power device 10 and the camera instrument fixing device 20 can be fixed in different manners. In this embodiment, the power device 10 and the camera instrument fixing device 20 are fixed with the screw. The connection manner of the power device 10 and the camera instrument fixing device 20 should not be construed as a limitation of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">When the underwater swimming aid in this embodiment operates,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the propellers 110 on the power device 10 provide power to drive the underwater swimming aid to advance so as to drive a user holding the swimming aid to swim forward. The waterproof camera instrument clamped on the camera instrument fixing device 20 can automatically photograph underwater scenes without being held by the user.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Finally, it should be noted that the above embodiments are merely used to clearly explain the present application by way of examples, and are not intended to limit the implementations of the present application. Those ordinarily skilled in the art can obtain different variations or transformations on the basis of the aforesaid description. It is unnecessary and impossible to exhaust all implementations herein. All obvious variations or transformations obtained on the basis of the aforesaid description should also fall within the protection scope of the present application.</p>
