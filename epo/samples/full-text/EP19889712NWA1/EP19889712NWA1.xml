<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The polycomb family negatively regulates gene expression through chromatin control mediated by histone modification. Enhancer of zeste homologue 1/2 (EZH1/2) is an active center of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which tri-methylates histone H3K27. EZH1 and EZH2 mutually compensate each other's functions and maintain an epigenome within a cell. Inhibition of EZH2 reduces the methylation level at H3K27 of a whole cell; however, the effect is limited by the compensation effect of EZH1. If EZH1 and EZH2 are simultaneously inhibited, methylation is more effectively eliminated (Non Patent Literature 1). Abnormalities of components of PRC2 cause cancer and functional abnormalities of stem cells. Particularly, abnormalities of the EZH2 gene and elevated<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> expression thereof induce accumulation of methylated H3K27me3, which is identified in many cancers. Studies have been aggressively conducted focusing on EZH2 as a new molecular target for cancer (Non Patent Literatures 2, 3) .</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">An EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, (2R)-7-chloro-2-[trans-4-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]-N-[(4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-carboxamide and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are known (Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">In terms of cancer therapy, it is known that therapies using a plurality of anticancer agents in combination are effective, and various studies (on combination therapy) have been actively conducted. However, it is extremely difficult to find a combination of medical agents exerting a combined effect, and a type of cancer on which the effect is exerted. Particularly, with regard to an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, i.e., (2R)-7-chloro-2-[trans-4-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]-N-[(4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-carboxamide and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, there is no literature reporting combined use thereof with another medical agent. Because of this, the kind of medical agent to be used in combination with this to exert a combined effect has not yet been known.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
