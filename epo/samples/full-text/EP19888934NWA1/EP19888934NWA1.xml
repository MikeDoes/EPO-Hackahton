<heading id="h0009">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The embryo transfer tool of the present invention and the embryo transfer device of the present invention using the embryo transfer tool are described below by using embodiments shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">An embryo transfer tool 1 of the present invention includes a flexible tube 11 that is made of a colorless and transparent synthetic resin, and a hub 12 that is provided at a proximal end portion of the flexible tube 11. The flexible tube 11 includes a first microparticle-containing portion 13a that has a predetermined width and extends over a predetermined length from a distal end portion of the flexible tube toward a proximal end thereof, a second microparticle-containing portion 13b that has a predetermined width, extends from the distal end portion toward the proximal end, and opposed to the first microparticle-containing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> portion 13a, a first colorless and transparent portion 15a that is positioned between the first microparticle-containing portion 13a and the second microparticle-containing portion 13b, extends over a predetermined length from a distal end of the flexible tube 11 toward the proximal end thereof, and allows the inside of a lumen to be visually recognized, and a second colorless and transparent portion 15b that is provided so as to opposed to the first colorless and transparent portion 15a. The first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b are positioned within an inner wall of the flexible tube 11, are not exposed in the outer surface and the inner surface of the flexible tube 11, and are constituted by a synthetic resin and a large number of microparticles 14 that are formed of a material different from the synthetic resin. The microparticles 14 are dispersed in the synthetic resin, and the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b include a large number of boundary surfaces that are formed between the synthetic resin and the microparticles.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The embryo transfer tool 1 of this embodiment has the flexible tube 11 having the lumen penetrating therethrough from its distal end to its proximal end and the hub 12 fixed to the proximal end portion of the flexible tube 11. The hub 12 may be formed integrally with the flexible tube.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The flexible tube 11 serves as a means for transferring an embryo and has the lumen 16 penetrating therethrough from its distal end to its proximal end. The length of the flexible tube is set to 70 to 800mm and favorably 200 to 600mm. The outer diameter of the flexible tube is set to 0.5 to 3mm and favorably 1 to 2mm. The inner diameter of the flexible tube is set to 0.3 to 0.7mm and favorably 0.4 to 0.6mm.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">As materials for forming the flexible tube 11, those having colorless, transparency and flexibility to a certain extent are preferable. It is possible to use synthetic rubber such as urethane rubber, silicone rubber, butadiene rubber, soft vinyl chloride, polyolefin (polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, mixture of polypropylene and polyethylene or mixture of polypropylene and polybutene), polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate), polyamide, elastomers such as polyolefin-based elastomer, polyamide-based elastomer, styrene-based elastomer (for example, styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer), polyurethane, and preferably, thermoplastic polyurethane (thermoplastic polyether polyurethane and thermoplastic polyester polyurethane are preferable. Segmented thermoplastic polyether polyurethane having a soft segment portion and a hard segment portion are especially preferable. More specifically, as a main component of the soft segment, polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol are preferable. As a main component of the hard segment, 1,4-butanediol is preferable). Polyamides or polyamide elastomers are preferred.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="f0004 f0005">Figs. 4 through 6</figref>, the flexible tube 11 has the first fine particle-containing portion 13a extended in the predetermined width and in the predetermined length from the distal end of the flexible tube toward the proximal end thereof and the second fine particle-containing portion 13b extended in the predetermined width from the distal end of the flexible tube toward the proximal end thereof and opposed to the first fine particle-containing portion 13a through the intermediary of the center of the flexible tube 11. In the embryo transfer tool 1 of this embodiment, the first and second fine particle-containing portions 13a and 13b are extended from the distal end of the flexible tube 11 to the proximal end thereof. As shown in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, it is necessary for the flexible tube to have the first and second fine particle-containing portions 13a and 13b at a part projected from a distal end of the flexible tube 21 of the sheath 2. The first and second fine particle-containing portions may not necessarily be formed at a part which is located proximally from the part projected from flexible tube.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> As shown in <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b are positioned within the inner wall of the flexible tube 11 and are not exposed in the outer surface and the inner surface of the flexible tube 11. Also, the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b are constituted by the synthetic resin and the large number of microparticles 14 that are formed of the material different from the synthetic resin. The microparticles 14 are substantially uniformly dispersed in the synthetic resin. The first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b include the large number of boundary surfaces formed between the synthetic resin and the microparticles 14, specifically, formed by surfaces of the microparticles 14. Ultrasonic waves reflect off boundary surfaces that are formed by different substances, and therefore, the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b containing the microparticles can be imaged by ultrasonic echoes, and positions of the microparticle-containing portions in a living body can be easily checked.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">As the synthetic resin used for the first and second fine particle-containing portions 13a and 13b, those having transparency and flexibility to a certain extent are preferable. It is possible to use synthetic rubber such as urethane rubber, silicone rubber, butadiene rubber, soft vinyl chloride, polyolefin (polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, mixture of polypropylene and polyethylene or mixture of polypropylene and polybutene), polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate), polyamide, elastomers such as polyolefin-based elastomer, polyamide-based elastomer, styrene-based elastomer (for example, styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer), polyurethane or polyurethane elastomer, for example, thermoplastic polyurethane (thermoplastic polyether polyurethane and thermoplastic polyester polyurethane are preferable. Segmented thermoplastic polyether polyurethane having a soft segment portion and a hard segment portion are especially preferable. More specifically, as a main<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> component of the soft segment, polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol are preferable. As a main component of the hard segment, 1,4-butanediol is preferable). Polyurethane, polyurethane elastomer, polyurethane and polyamide elastomers are preferred.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The synthetic resin used in the first and second fine particle-containing portions 13a and 13b may be transparent and colored. As the coloring, blue, green, gray and the like are preferable.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Also, it is preferable that the synthetic resin forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b is a synthetic resin that has higher flexibility than the synthetic resin forming the flexible tube 11. Due to containing microparticles, the material forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b is highly likely to have a lower flexibility than in the case of not containing microparticles. Therefore, if the above configuration is employed, it is possible to reduce a difference in physical properties between the material forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b and the material forming the flexible tube. In particular, it is preferable that the material forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions, which is constituted by the microparticles and the synthetic resin, has flexibility that is substantially equivalent to the flexibility of the synthetic resin (material) forming the flexible tube. The flexibility can be adjusted by adjusting the synthetic resin forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b and the amount of microparticles added to the synthetic resin. This configuration further reduces the difference in physical properties between the material forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b and the material forming the flexible tube. Note that the material forming the first and second microparticle-containing portions 13a and 13b may be the same as the material forming the flexible tube.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">In a case where different materials are selected as a microparticle-free<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> portion forming resin (first resin) and a microparticle-containing portion forming resin (second resin), it is preferable to select materials that have good compatibility with each other as the first resin and the second resin from the standpoint of coextrusion moldability. Having good compatibility means that the thermodynamic mutual solubility of the materials is good, in other words, the materials do not separate from each other after being cured. A resin that has higher flexibility (is softer) than the first resin is selected as the second resin.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">It is desirable to select resins that are of the same type and have different physical properties, as the first resin and the second resin. Examples of types of resin include polyurethane-based resin, polyolefin-based resin, polyamide-based resin, and polyester-based resin.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">More specifically, it is conceivable to: select a soft polyurethane as the first resin and select a polyurethane that is softer than the first resin, as the second resin; select a polyamide elastomer as the first resin and select a polyamide elastomer that is softer than the first resin, as the second resin; select a polyolefin-based elastomer (e.g., a polyethylene elastomer) as the first resin and select a polyolefin-based elastomer (e.g., a polyethylene elastomer) that is softer than the first resin, as the second resin; or select a polyester-based elastomer (e.g., a polyester elastomer) as the first resin and select a polyester-based elastomer (e.g., a polyester elastomer) that is softer than the first resin, as the second resin. Note that it is thought that, at boundary portions between the first resin and the second resin, the first resin and the second resin are in a mixed state of being microscopically mixed as a result of a combination of resins that have high compatibility with each other being selected as the first resin and the second resin. It is thought that, accordingly, there is no interface in the strict sense between the first resin and the second resin, and boundary portions are formed by a mixture of the first resin and the second resin.</p>

It is also preferable that the hollow microparticles are optically transparent microparticles. In particular, optically transparent hollow glass beads (optically transparent hollow glass microspheres) and optically transparent hollow synthetic resin beads (optically transparent hollow synthetic resin microspheres) are preferable as the hollow microparticles. Microparticles that have internal spaces and have a diameter of 0.5 to 200 µm are preferable as the hollow microparticles. In particular, it is preferable that the diameter is 1 to 150 µm, or more specifically 10 to 120 µm. The hollow microparticles may be transparent and colored.

The volume median diameter is also called the D50 diameter, and indicates that 50 volume% of the hollow microspheres in a particle size distribution are smaller than that diameter. The volume median diameter is determined through laser diffraction by dispersing the hollow glass microspheres in degassed deionized water. For example, "MASTERSIZER 2000" (product name) manufactured by Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK can be used as a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. Also, it is preferable that the average particle size of the hollow glass microspheres is 10 to 80 µm, or in particular within the range of 30 to 70 µm.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The hollow microspheres (hollow glass beads) that are used need to have sufficiently high strength in order to remain when the flexible tube is extrusion molded.

Note that each of the above numerical values of pressure resistance means the numerical value MPa ±5%. The 90% yield pressure resistance may be at least 100 MPa. The collapse strength of the hollow microspheres (hollow glass beads) is preferably measured for a dispersion of the hollow glass microspheres in glycerol using ASTM D3102-72 "Hydrostatic Collapse Strength of Hollow Glass Microspheres"; with the exception that the sample size (in grams) is equal to 10 times the density of the glass bubbles, for example.</p>
