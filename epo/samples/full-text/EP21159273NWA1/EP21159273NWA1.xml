<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system of an engine, an engine comprising the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, an automobile comprising an engine that comprises the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, and an automobile comprising the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">There is known a technology for engines for driving a vehicle, etc., that brings a portion of exhaust gas (also referred to as EGR gas) back into intake gas, so-called EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation). A majority of EGR systems that perform EGR are usually installed with an EGR cooler to cool high-temperature EGR gas.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Regarding the disclosed technology, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2016102429A"><text>JP2016-102429A</text></patcit> discloses an engine in which an EGR cooler is disposed on an upper part of an intake manifold.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Condensed water containing oxidizing substances is generated inside the EGR cooler. Therefore, when the EGR cooler is placed transversely as in the engine of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2016102429A"><text>JP2016-102429A</text></patcit>, it is preferred to avoid the condensed water from accumulating in the EGR cooler. For this, a considerable general method is to tilt the EGR cooler and flow the condensed water down.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the engine is installed in a limited space of an engine bay. Moreover, when the EGR cooler is disposed on the upper part of the intake manifold as in the engine of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2016A"><text>JP2016-</text></patcit><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP102429A"><text>102429A</text></patcit>, a gap formed between the EGR cooler and a bonnet covering an upper part of the EGR cooler becomes narrow. This gap needs to have a given size in order for the bonnet to deform at the time of a collision and mitigate its impact.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, in order to tilt the transversely placed EGR cooler so that the condensed water flows down, one of end parts of the EGR cooler needs to be greatly lifted. In this case, it becomes difficult to secure the at least given size of gap. For this reason, it is not easy to improve a drainage property of condensed water by simply tilting the EGR cooler. Therefore, a layout of the overall EGR system has been reviewed in order to secure the gap between the engine and the bonnet and to improve the drainage property of the EGR cooler placed transversely on the engine.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The present disclosure is made in view of the above situation, and one purpose thereof is to provide an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system of an engine, which improves a drainage property of an EGR cooler of the EGR system without losing its cooling performance, while reducing an overall height of the EGR system.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an EGR system of an engine is provided, which includes an engine body including a cylinder head provided in an upper part of the engine body and forming a plurality of combustion chambers in which combustion is performed, a first end surface, and a second end surface, the plurality of combustion chambers being lined up between the first end surface and the second end surface. The system includes an intake passage configured to introduce intake air into each of the plurality of combustion chambers via an intake manifold attached to the cylinder head, an exhaust passage connected to the cylinder head and through which exhaust gas can be discharged from the combustion chambers, and an EGR passage connecting the exhaust passage to the intake passage and configured to recirculate the exhaust gas as EGR gas to the intake passage.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The EGR passage includes an EGR cooler configured to cool the EGR gas while the EGR gas flows from a gas inflow port to a gas outflow port, an EGR internal passage passing through the cylinder head, on an upstream side of the EGR cooler, and a relay passage extending outside the cylinder head and connecting the EGR internal passage to the EGR cooler. The cylinder head is formed in the first end surface with a head EGR gas exit from which the EGR gas can be discharged after passing through the cylinder head.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The EGR cooler is formed in a columnar shape having the gas inflow port at one end side substantially in a longitudinal direction and the gas outflow port at the other end side substantially in the longitudinal direction, and is arranged above the intake manifold so as to locate the gas inflow port on the first end surface side and the gas outflow port on the second end surface side, the relay passage communicating with the EGR internal passage, on an external side of the engine compared to the head EGR gas exit.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The EGR cooler inclines substantially downward from the gas outflow port toward the gas inflow port, and the relay passage is connected to the gas inflow port while being bent substantially downward toward the upstream side.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">According to this engine EGR system, the EGR passage includes the EGR cooler, which can cool the EGR gas. The EGR passage further includes the EGR internal passage passing through the cylinder head, on the upstream side of the EGR cooler. Normally, a water-cooling passage configured to cool the combustion chambers is formed in the cylinder head. By the heat exchange with the cooling water flowing in the water-cooling passage, the EGR gas flowing in the EGR internal passage can be cooled. Therefore, the EGR gas is effectively cooled.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The EGR cooler is formed in a columnar shape substantially extending in a direction in which the EGR gas flows (gas flow direction). By having its entire length longer, the cooling performance of the EGR cooler is secured even when its vertical width is reduced. While the vertical width of the EGR cooler is reduced, its height is reduced.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The EGR cooler is arranged so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the cylinder head in a state where its orientation is matched with the gas flow direction. Thereby, the smooth inflow and outflow of the EGR gas are ensured, and the height of the EGR cooler is reduced so as to be within the entire length range of the cylinder head.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The relay passage is connected to communicate with the EGR internal passage, on the external side of the end surface of the cylinder head. That is, the cylinder head is provided in the first end surface with the exit from which the EGR gas is discharged (can be discharged) after passing through the cylinder head (head EGR gas exit). The relay passage communicates with the EGR internal passage on further outward from the head EGR gas exit. By connecting the relay passage at a position externally away from the first end surface, a distance to the EGR cooler increases, and the relay passage is extended.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, the EGR cooler inclines downward from the gas outflow port toward the gas inflow port. Since the EGR cooler is long in the gas flow direction, the condensed water generated by the EGR cooler smoothly flows to the upstream side even if the inclination is gentle. In addition, the condensed water is prevented from entering the downstream side where an EGR valve is located.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the relay passage is connected to the gas inflow port while being bent downward toward the upstream. When a large amount of EGR gas flows through the EGR passage, a channel cross section of the relay passage is desirably large, and a channel resistance of the relay passage is desirably small. Therefore, it is desirable that the relay passage is constituted<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> by a pipe having a large diameter and bent in the gas flow direction, and both end parts of the relay passage are smoothly connected.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">However, when the diameter becomes large, a degree of bend cannot be large and a radius of curvature becomes large. Regarding this, in this structure, the relay passage is connected at the position outward from the end surface of the cylinder head. Therefore, the distance to the gas inflow port becomes long.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, the entire length of the relay passage becomes long, and the relay passage having a large pipe diameter and a large radius of curvature is structured. The both end parts of the relay passage are smoothly connected in a state where the relay passage is bent downward toward the upstream. As a result, a large amount of EGR gas smoothly flows, and condensed water which flows down to the relay passage from the EGR cooler is smoothly discharged. Therefore, while the overall EGR system including the EGR cooler is reduced in its height, a drainage property of the EGR cooler is improved without losing its cooling performance.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The EGR system may further include a first attachment member attached to the first end surface, the first attachment member including an extension passage located on the external side of the engine compared to the first end surface and constituting the EGR internal passage. The relay passage may be connected to the first attachment member to communicate with the extension passage.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">According to this structure, the first attachment member including the extension passage constituting the EGR internal passage is attached to the first end surface of the cylinder head. With this first attachment member, the EGR internal passage is extended from the first end surface of the cylinder head to the position outward from the first end surface. Therefore, by forming the water-cooling passage also in the first attachment member, heat is exchanged with the cooling water, and the EGR gas is effectively cooled.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Since the relay passage is connected to the first attachment member to communicate with the extension passage, the distance to the gas inflow port can be long as described above. Therefore, the large amount of EGR gas smoothly flows, and the drainage property of the EGR cooler is improved.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The EGR passage may further include an EGR valve configured to adjust a flow rate of the EGR gas. The EGR valve may be disposed downstream of the EGR cooler via a connecting passage connected to the gas outflow port. The EGR valve may be directly fixed to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> an upper part of the intake manifold, and the connecting passage may pass the upper side of the EGR valve, extend toward the second end surface, and be connected to an upper part of the EGR valve.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">That is, a layout of the downstream part of the EGR cooler in the EGR passage is also devised. By directly fixing the EGR valve to the intake manifold, the supporting strength of the EGR valve increases and a swaying movement of the EGR valve is reduced. The height of the EGR valve is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The connecting passage which connects between the EGR valve and the EGR cooler may be connected to the upper part of the EGR valve in a state where it passes the upper side of the EGR valve to extend toward the second end surface. Therefore, even with the connecting passage of the laterally long shape, the connecting passage is arrangeable without projecting outwardly from the second end surface of the cylinder head. As a result, the entire engine including the EGR system is efficiently disposed in an engine bay.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The EGR cooler may be arranged to incline in a lateral direction and the relay passage may be arranged to incline in a vertical direction so that the gas outflow port is located away from the cylinder head compared to the gas inflow port.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">According to this structure, the EGR cooler is also arranged to incline in a lateral direction. In detail, the EGR cooler is arranged to incline so that the gas outflow port is located away from the cylinder head than the gas inflow port when seen vertically.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Accordingly, the relay passage is also arranged to incline in a vertical direction. In detail, the relay passage is arranged to incline to the up-and-down direction so that the upstream side is located away from the gas inflow port than the downstream side, when seen in the left-and-right direction. Thus, the EGR cooler and the relay passage become even longer. Therefore, while having an efficient arrangement in a compact space, a smooth flow of EGR gas and a smooth discharge of condensed water are achieved.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The EGR system may further include a second attachment member disposed near the first end surface of the cylinder head, the second attachment member being disposed in a space formed below the EGR cooler and the relay passage.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">According to this structure, the portion of the EGR passage including the EGR cooler and the relay passage is arranged to pass the upper side of the intake manifold and extend toward<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the first end surface of the cylinder head. In such a case, a certain size of space is created below the EGR cooler and the relay passage.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Since the second attachment member is disposed in this space, the second attachment member is effectively disposed in a space efficient manner, and thus, dead space is not created.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">When the engine operates in a high load range including a full load, the engine may perform combustion with a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio as a target value.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Normally when the engine operates in the high load range, a combustion temperature rises and abnormal combustion occurs. Therefore, the amount of fuel is increased and latent heat of vaporization of the fuel is used to cool mixture gas in order to avoid abnormal combustion. However, in this control, the fuel amount increases and therefore fuel efficiency degrades.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Meanwhile, when performing combustion at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, fuel efficiency is improved, but abnormal combustion cannot be avoided because the latent heat of vaporization cannot be used. If the circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased in this case, an oxygen concentration of the intake air decreases, and thus the abnormal combustion can be avoided. However, by performing the combustion at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the temperature of the exhaust gas increases.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Therefore, when the engine operates in the high load range, if performing the combustion at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio while the circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased to avoid abnormal combustion, the EGR gas is recirculated at a higher temperature and in a larger amount compared to a conventional example. The heat amount of the EGR gas becomes excessive with respect to performance of the EGR cooler, and thus the durability of the EGR cooler degrades.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In this regard, according to this engine EGR system, as described above, the excess heat of the EGR gas flowing into the EGR cooler can be removed effectively. Therefore, even when the high temperature and large amount of EGR gas is recirculated, the heat amount of the EGR gas can be suppressed from becoming excessive with respect to the performance of the EGR cooler. As a result, fuel efficiency improves.<br/>

As illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0004">4</figref>, the upper part of the engine 1 is covered by a bonnet 2. A gap G between the engine 1 and the bonnet 2 needs to have at least a given size in order for the bonnet 2 to deform at the time of a collision and its impact is mitigated. This engine 1 is reduced in its overall height, including the EGR system, so as to secure the gap G.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The automobile runs by a vehicle driver controlling an operation of the engine 1. The engine 1 combusts a mixture gas containing gasoline in combustion chambers 12 described later. The engine 1 is a four-stroke cycle engine which repeats an intake stroke, a compression stroke, an expansion stroke, and an exhaust stroke.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">The engine 1 includes an intake passage 20 which sends intake air to each of the combustion chambers 12, and an exhaust passage 30 which discharges exhaust gas from the combustion chamber 12, in accordance with the combustion cycle. The engine 1 also includes the EGR system described above. That is, the engine 1 performs EGR in which a portion of the exhaust gas discharged to the exhaust passage 30 is recirculated back to the intake passage 20 as EGR gas.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In this engine 1, a circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased larger than a conventional amount to avoid abnormal combustion. Thus, a combustion with a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio as a target value is performed even when the engine 1 operates in a high load range.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Normally when the engine 1 operates in the high load range where a high torque output is required, a combustion temperature rises and abnormal combustion occurs. Therefore, in the high load range, an enrichment control in which a ratio of an air amount with respect to a fuel amount (so-called A/F, air-fuel ratio) is reduced is performed. Latent heat of vaporization of the fuel thus increased is used to cool the mixture gas in order to avoid abnormal combustion. However, in the enrichment control, the fuel amount increases and therefore fuel efficiency degrades.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Meanwhile, performing combustion at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, in which the fuel and oxygen combust proportionally, improves fuel efficiency. However, such combustion at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio cannot utilize the latent heat of vaporization, and abnormal combustion cannot be avoided. If the circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased in this case, an oxygen concentration of the intake air decreases. As a result, a self-ignition timing is delayed and abnormal combustion can be avoided.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">This engine 1 performs combustion with the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio as the target value when operating in the high load range. Further, the circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased to avoid abnormal combustion. The high load range referred to here is, for example, a range higher than a given load, including a full engine load, for example a high load range determined by bisecting an operating range of the engine 1 in the load direction. The high load range may be a highest load range determined by dividing the operating range of the engine 1 into three regions in the load direction.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">When combusting at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the temperature of the exhaust gas becomes high. Therefore, when the engine 1 operates in the high load range, EGR gas is recirculated in a larger amount and at a higher temperature compared to a conventional example. In this regard, the engine 1, specifically the EGR system thereof, is devised to resolve problems that occur accordingly (details will be described later).</p>

<p id="p0049" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the engine 1 includes an engine body 10 comprised of a cylinder block 10a and the cylinder head 11. The cylinder head 11 is mounted on the cylinder block 10a. The cylinder head 11 constitutes the upper part of the engine body 10, and the cylinder block 10a constitutes a lower part of the engine body 10. The engine body 10 is formed with a plurality of combustion chambers 12. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the engine 1 of this example is a so-called four-cylinder engine having four combustion chambers 12.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The four combustion chambers 12 are arranged in line in an extending direction of a non-illustrated crankshaft (output shaft direction). The engine body 10 is longer in the output shaft direction. The engine body 10 is arranged transversely in the engine bay so that its output shaft direction substantially coincides with a vehicle width direction (left-and-right direction).</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, when the cylinder head 11 is used as a reference, a pair of relatively long side surfaces of the cylinder head 11 face the front-and-rear direction, respectively (front side surface 11a and rear side surface 11b). The four combustion chambers 12 are arranged in line between left and right end faces (first end surface 11c and second end surface 11d respectively) of the cylinder head 11.

A lower surface of each cylinder is closed by<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the piston. An upper surface of each cylinder is closed by the cylinder head 11. The engine body 10 is partitioned by the cylinder block 10a, the pistons, and the cylinder head 11, and thus, the combustion chambers 12 are formed therein.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">When the engine 1 is operating, the engine body 10 rises high in temperature. A cooling system which cools with cooling water is attached to the engine 1 to cool the engine body 10. Although not illustrated, the water-cooling system is comprised of a water pump and a radiator. The water-cooling system cools the engine body 10, a heater core for air conditioning, an EGR cooler 41, and an ATF cooler (a cooler which cools oil used in transmission) by exchanging heat with the cooling water.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a water-cooling passage 50 through which cooling water flows is formed around each of the combustion chambers 12 of the cylinder block 10a and the cylinder head 11. By operating a water pump, the cooling water circulates in the water-cooling passage 50.</p>

A thermostat 54 (indicated by a two-dotted chain line in <figref idref="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>) is attached to the water outlet 52. The thermostat 54 switches the channel of the cooling water. Note that although the engine 1 is also provided with a combustion supply system which supplies fuel to each combustion chamber 12, an ignition plug which ignites the mixture gas, a valve operating mechanism, etc., illustration and description thereof are omitted for the sake of convenience.</p>

<p id="p0056" num="0056">Two intake ports 13 communicating with the combustion chamber 12 are formed in the front side surface 11a of the cylinder head 11. Each intake port 13 communicates with the combustion chamber 12 via an openable intake valve. In this engine 1, the intake port 13 is open to the front side surface 11a of the cylinder head 11 (total of eight openings). The intake passage 20 is connected to the front side surface 11a of the cylinder head 11 so as to communicate with the intake port 13.</p>

In the first cooling portion CP1, the EGR gas flowing in the EGR internal passage 44 is indirectly in contact with the cooling water flowing in the water-cooling passage 50 via a thin pipe wall.

Further, the EGR cooler 41 has<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> a substantially flat columnar shape in which a horizontal width is larger than a vertical width of the channel cross section. Therefore, the height of the EGR cooler 41 is reduced by narrowing the vertical width. The entire length is extended and thus the cooling performance is secured.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">Here, the columnar shape may be a substantially rectangular solid or a cylindrical shape. Further, although a surface of the EGR cooler 41 is provided with a pipe which allows cooling water to enter and exit, and unevenness for the purpose of ensuring rigidity, the columnar shape referred to here includes such distorted shapes.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">The EGR cooler 41 is located above the intake manifold 23 so that the gas inflow port 41 a is located on the side of the first end surface 11c and the gas outflow port 41 b is located on the second end surface 11d side. In other words, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged on top of the intake manifold 23 in a substantially up-down direction. Particularly, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged such that the gas inflow port 41a is located on the side of the first end surface 11c and the gas outflow port 41b is located on the second end surface 11d side. That is, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged so as to extend substantially in the longitudinal direction of the cylinder head 11 in a state where its orientation is matched with the direction in which the EGR gas flows (gas flow direction).

By connecting the relay pipe 45 at a position externally away from the first end surface 11c, a distance to the EGR cooler 41 increases, and the relay pipe 45 is extended.</p>

Accordingly, the gas outflow port 41b is located at a position substantially higher than the position of the gas inflow port 41a in a substantially up-down direction. In the vehicle width direction, the gas outflow port 41b is located substantially in the center of the engine bay, and the gas inflow port 41a is located on the left side of the engine bay. Then, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged so as to gently incline downwardly from the right side to the left side.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">Since the EGR cooler 41 has a substantially flat shape as described above, it may be tilted with reduced height. Since the EGR cooler 41 is substantially long in the gas flow direction, the condensed water generated by the EGR cooler 41 smoothly flows to the upstream side even if the inclination is gentle. In addition, the condensed water is prevented from entering the downstream side where the EGR valve 42 is located.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">Normally, the bonnet 2 has an upwardly bulging shape as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. Therefore, the bonnet 2 is higher in an intermediate part in the vehicle width direction. By inclining the EGR cooler 41 in this manner, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged along the shape of the bonnet 2. Therefore, it becomes easy to secure the gap G between the EGR cooler 41 and the bonnet 2.</p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0006">6</figref>, the relay pipe 45 is connected to the gas inflow port 41a in a bent state so that it is positioned lower as it extends upstream.</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">A large amount of EGR gas flows through the EGR passage 40. Therefore, the channel cross section of the relay pipe 45 is desirably large, and the channel resistance of the relay pipe 45 is desirably small. Therefore, it is desirably that the relay pipe 45 is constituted by a pipe<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> having a large diameter and bent in the flow direction of gas, and the relay pipe 45 is smoothly connected to the gas inflow port 41a and the water outlet 52.</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">By inclining the EGR cooler 41, the condensed water flows down to the relay pipe 45. Therefore, even in the relay pipe 45, the condensed water needs to flow smoothly to the upstream side. Therefore, the relay pipe 45 also needs to be lowered toward the upstream side. In other words, the relay pipe 45 is configured so as to bend downwardly substantially in an up-down direction and toward the upstream side of the EGR passage 40. Then, in order to smoothly connect to the gas inflow port 41a, the downstream portion of the relay pipe 45 needs to be inclined at an angle similar to that of the EGR cooler 41. Similarly, the upstream portion of the relay pipe 45 needs to be smoothly connected to the water outlet 52.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">However, when the diameter becomes large, a degree of bend cannot be large and a radius of curvature becomes large. In this regard, in this engine 1, the relay pipe 45 is connected at a position outwardly separated from the first end surface 11c of the cylinder head 11. Therefore, the distance to the gas inflow port 41a becomes long.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">As a result, the entire length of the relay pipe 45 becomes long, and the relay pipe 45 having a large pipe diameter and a large radius of curvature is structured. The relay pipe 45 is smoothly connected to each of the gas inflow port 41a and the water outlet 52. As a result, a large amount of EGR gas smoothly flows, and condensed water is smoothly discharged. By bending the relay pipe 45, its outward projection amount from the first end surface 11c of the cylinder head 11 is also reduced. Therefore, there is no need to secure a large installation space in the engine bay.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">Further, the EGR cooler 41 is also arranged to incline substantially in a lateral direction. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, the EGR cooler 41 is arranged to incline substantially toward one of the front-rear direction so that the gas outflow port 41b is located away from the cylinder head 11 than the gas inflow port 41a when seen vertically.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">Accordingly, the relay passage 45 is also arranged to incline in a vertical direction as illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. For example, the relay passage is arranged to incline to one of the up-and-down direction so that the upstream side is located away from the gas inflow port 41a than the downstream side, when seen in the left-and-right direction. Thus, the EGR cooler 41 and the relay pipe 45 become even longer. Therefore, while having an efficient arrangement in a compact space, a smooth flow of EGR gas and a smooth discharge of condensed water are achieved.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">Furthermore, a layout of a downstream part of the EGR cooler 41 in the EGR passage 40 is also devised.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">Figs. 2</figref>, <figref idref="f0007">7</figref>, and <figref idref="f0008">8</figref>, the EGR valve 42 is directly fixed to the upper part of the intake manifold 23. Specifically, the EGR valve 42 is comprised of a valve body 42a, and a valve drive motor 42b. The valve drive motor 42b is integrated with the valve body 42a by being assembled thereto.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">Although not illustrated, a gas flow channel through which the EGR gas flows and a valve body which adjusts an opening degree of the gas flow channel are provided inside the valve body 42a. The gas flow channel extends substantially in the up-and-down direction. The valve drive motor 42b drives the valve body according to a control thereof to adjust the opening degree of the gas flow channel. A flange part 42c is provided to the outside of the valve body 42a to protrude from a circumference thereof.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, an attaching bracket 23c is provided to the upper part of the intake manifold 23, specifically between two intake branch pipes 23a located on the right side of the upper part. The flange part 42c is fastened to the attaching bracket 23c by a plurality of bolts to fix the EGR valve 42 directly to the upper part of the intake manifold 23.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">By directly fixing the EGR valve 42 to the intake manifold 23, the supporting strength of the EGR valve 42 increases and a swaying movement of the EGR valve 42 is reduced. The height of the EGR valve 42 is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0005">Figs. 5</figref>, <figref idref="f0007">7</figref>, and <figref idref="f0008">8</figref>, a connecting pipe 47 (connecting passage) is connected to the gas outflow port 41b of the EGR cooler 41. The connecting pipe 47 passes the upper side of the EGR valve 42 and extends toward the second end surface 11d, and is connected to the upper part of the EGR valve 42. In other words, the connecting pipe 47 is configured so as to pass the upper side of the EGR valve 42 and to extend substantially toward the second end surface 11d of the cylinder head 11. Particularly, the connecting pipe 47 is connected to the upper part of the EGR valve 42.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">The connecting pipe 47 is long in the gas flow direction. In other words, the connecting pipe 47 is configured to have a length in the gas flow direction. Further, the connecting pipe 47 has a flat shape of which a channel cross section is laterally longer than vertically. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0008">8</figref>, the connecting pipe 47 is arranged to incline so that its upstream side is higher than the downstream side substantially in an up-down direction. Therefore, the condensed water<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> flows to the gas channel of the EGR valve 42 through the connecting pipe 47 even after passing the EGR cooler 41, without accumulating.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">Further, similar to the EGR cooler 41, the connecting pipe 47 is arranged along the shape of the bonnet 2. Therefore, it also becomes easy to secure the gap G between the connecting pipe 47 and the bonnet 2.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">The connecting pipe 47 passes the upper side of the EGR valve 42 (specifically, the valve drive motor 42b) and extends toward the second end surface 11d. Therefore, even with the connecting pipe 47 of the laterally long shape, the connecting pipe 47 is arrangeable without projecting outwardly from the second end surface 11d of the cylinder head 11. As a result, the entire engine 1 including the EGR system is efficiently disposed in the engine bay.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">As described above, the connecting bracket 23b of the intake manifold 23 is provided with the plurality of swirl control valves 25. Further, the drive motor 26 which drives the swirl control valves 25 is attached to the engine body 10. The drive motor 26 needs to be disposed near the connecting bracket 23b due to its structural property.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In this regard, in this engine 1, the upstream portion of the EGR passage 40 including the EGR cooler 41 and the relay pipe 45 is arranged to pass the upper side of the intake manifold 23 and extend toward the first end surface 11c of the cylinder head 11. In such a case, a certain size of space is created below the EGR cooler 41 and the relay pipe 45.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idref="f0006">6</figref>, the drive motor 26 is disposed in this space. Therefore, the drive motor 26 is effectively disposed in a space efficient manner. Thus, a dead space is not created.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">Thus, since the EGR passage 40 of this engine 1 is formed with the EGR internal passage 44 devised in structure and arrangement, the excess heat of the EGR gas is effectively removed. As a result, the durability of the EGR cooler 41 and the cooling performance of the EGR gas improve.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">Moreover, since the entire layout of the EGR system is devised, a large amount of EGR gas is smoothly recirculated and the condensed water generated by the EGR cooler 41 is smoothly discharged. Furthermore, since the overall height of the engine 1 is reduced, the gap G of a given size is also secured between the engine 1 and the bonnet 2.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">Thus, in this engine 1, the EGR gas is recirculated in a larger amount at a higher temperature compared to a conventional example. As a result, when the engine operates in the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> high load range, even if the combustion is performed with the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio as the target value, the circulation amount of the EGR gas is increased to avoid abnormal combustion. Therefore, the EGR system of this engine 1 is improved in fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">Note that the EGR system of the engine according to the present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment and includes various other configurations. For example, although the gasoline engine is illustrated in the above embodiment, the present disclosure is applicable to a diesel engine. Moreover, although the naturally aspirated engine is illustrated, the present disclosure is applicable to an engine with a forced induction system.</p>
