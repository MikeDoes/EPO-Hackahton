<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a syringe safety cap and a safety syringe including the same, and more particularly, to a syringe safety cap and a safety syringe including the same capable of safely protecting an injection needle to prevent needlestick injuries.</p>
<heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, a syringe includes a cylindrical cylinder having a space formed therein to store an injection solution, a piston moved to absorb or discharge the injection solution from inside the cylinder, a needle holder coupled to a front portion of the cylinder, and a needle coupled to the needle holder.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, securing safety of an injection needle is extremely important. In order to reduce the risk of needlestick injuries that can be fatal in some cases and to prevent reuse of a syringe by a person who misuses a drug so that the probability of drug misuse and the spread of contagious diseases are suppressed, a need has arisen for a disposable syringe and a disposable intravenous infusion set that prevent reuse thereof.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">These are also necessary to allow healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses who provide professional care to patients, to avoid becoming patients themselves due to secondary infection caused by an accidental needlestick injury.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, safety syringes that can prevent hospital-acquired infection of healthcare workers have been in use.</p>

<p id="p0012" num="0012">Hereinafter, a syringe safety cap and a safety syringe including the same according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The present disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure may be implemented in various different forms and thus is not limited to the embodiments described herein. Also, parts unrelated to the description have been omitted from the drawings to clearly describe the present disclosure, and like elements are denoted by like reference numerals throughout the specification.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Throughout the specification, when a certain portion is described as being "connected to (linked to, in contact with, coupled to)" another portion, this not only includes a case in which the portion is "directly connected" to the other portion but also includes a case in which the portion is "indirectly connected" to the other portion while another constituent member is disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a safety syringe including a syringe safety cap according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the syringe safety cap according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating the syringe safety cap according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p0017" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a safety syringe (also abbreviated as "syringe") may include a cylinder 200, an injection needle 300, and a syringe safety cap 400.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The cylinder 200 may form a main body of the safety syringe and accommodate a medicinal fluid or accommodate different medicines or liquid medicines therein. When two or more types of medicines or liquid medicines are accommodated in the cylinder 200, at least two or more rubber stoppers may be arranged inside the cylinder 200, and different medicines or liquid medicines may be accommodated in separate accommodation spaces in the cylinder that are isolated by the stoppers.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The injection needle 300 may be provided at one end portion of the cylinder 200. Here, a needle holder 301 may be further provided at the one end portion of the cylinder 200, and the injection needle 300 may be coupled to the needle holder 301. That is, the injection needle 300 may be fixed to the needle holder 301, and the needle holder 301 may be mounted on the cylinder 200.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Also, a plunger rod may be coupled to the other end portion of the cylinder. A user may press the plunger rod toward the injection needle 300 to discharge a medicinal fluid, which is in the accommodation space in the cylinder, to the outside through the injection needle 300.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Also, the syringe safety cap 400 may be coupled to the cylinder 200. For example, the syringe safety cap 400 may be coupled to the one end portion of the cylinder that is adjacent to the injection needle 300. The syringe safety cap 400 may selectively cover the injection needle 300 and, in this way, prevent a needlestick injury caused by the injection needle 300. For example, the syringe safety cap 400 may also be fitted and coupled to the cylinder 200 or heat-bonded to the cylinder 200.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Also, the syringe safety cap 400 relating to an embodiment (first embodiment) of the present disclosure may include a base portion 410, a link portion<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 430, a first elastic portion 440, a safety cover portion 450, and a second elastic portion 460.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Specifically, the syringe safety cap 400 includes the base portion 410 having a mounting portion to be mounted on the cylinder 200 of the syringe, the link portion 430 rotatably connected to the base portion 410, and the first elastic portion 440 configured to provide a rotational force so that the link portion 430 rotates with respect to the base portion 410.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Also, the syringe safety cap 400 includes the safety cover portion 450 rotatably connected to the link portion 430, detachably fixed to the base portion 410, and configured to, when detached from the base portion 410 and rotating, surround the injection needle 300 of the syringe, and the second elastic portion 460 configured to provide a rotational force so that the safety cover portion 450 rotates with respect to the link portion 430.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">First, the base portion 410 may be coupled to the one end portion of the cylinder 200 having a medicinal fluid accommodated therein.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Also, the link portion 430 may be axially coupled (or connected) to the base portion 410. In the present document, being "axially coupled (or connected)" refers to being coupled (connected) to be rotatable about a predetermined axis of rotation. For example, the syringe safety cap may have a first axial portion configured to provide a center of rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410. Also, the first axial portion may include the first elastic portion 430 described above.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Here, the first axial portion may include a first rotating shaft 434 and a first coupling hole 417 mounted to allow rotation of the first rotating shaft 434. Specifically, the link portion 430 may include any one of the first rotating shaft 434<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and the first coupling hole 417 constituting the first axial portion, and the base portion 410 may include the other one of the first rotating shaft 434 and the first coupling hole 417 constituting the first axial portion. For example, referring to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the link portion 430 may include the first rotating shaft 434 and the base portion 410 may include the first coupling hole 417, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the opposite is also possible.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Also, the safety cover portion 450 may be axially coupled (or connected) to the link portion 430. The syringe safety cap may have a second axial portion configured to provide a center of rotation of the safety cover portion 450 with respect to the link portion 430. Also, the second axial portion may include the second elastic portion 460 described above.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Here, the second axial portion may include a second rotating shaft 452 and a second coupling hole 433 mounted to allow rotation of the second rotating shaft 452. Specifically, the link portion 430 may include any one of the second rotating shaft 452 and the second coupling hole 433 constituting the second axial portion, and the safety cover portion 450 may include the other one of the second rotating shaft 452 and the second coupling hole 433 constituting the second axial portion. For example, referring to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the safety cover portion 450 may include the second rotating shaft 452 and the link portion 430 may include the second coupling hole 433, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the opposite is also possible.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Also, the injection needle 300 of the syringe may be located between the first axial portion, which provides the center of rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410, and the second axial portion, which provides the center of rotation of the safety cover portion with respect to the link portion 330.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> That is, the injection needle 300 may be located between the first axial portion and the second axial portion.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">For example, the first axial portion may be located at one end portion of the link portion 430, and the second axial portion may be located at the other end portion thereof. Also, in a state in which the safety cover portion 450 is fixed to the base portion 410, the link portion 430 may be disposed to surround a partial area of the cylinder 200. Also, in a process in which the safety cover portion 450 is detached from the base portion 410 and surrounds the injection needle 300, the safety cover portion 450 may break away from the cylinder 200 of the syringe.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Meanwhile, in the process in which the safety cover portion 450 surrounds the injection needle, the second axial portion may be moved to approach the injection needle 200 of the syringe. Unlike this, the first axial portion may be provided so that a change in the position thereof does not occur in the process in which the safety cover portion 450 surrounds the injection needle.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Also, the first axial portion, which provides the center of rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410, and the second axial portion, which provides the center of rotation of the safety cover portion 450 with respect to the link portion 430, may be arranged to be parallel. Meanwhile, the first axial portion and the second axial portion may each be provided so that the axis of the center of rotation thereof is perpendicular to a direction of a central axis C of the cylinder. In the present document, the reference sign "C" indicates the central axis of the cylinder, and the central axis of the cylinder may be coaxial with the injection needle 300.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Also, in the process in which the safety cover portion 450 surrounds the injection needle 300, a direction of rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410 and a direction of rotation of the safety cover portion 450 with<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> respect to the link portion 430 may be provided to be the same. That is, in the process in which the safety cover portion 450 surrounds the injection needle 300, rotation about the first axial portion and rotation about the second axial portion may be performed in the same direction (for example, a first direction of rotation).</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Also, in the process in which the safety cover portion 450 is detached (or uncoupled) from the base portion 410 and surrounds the injection needle 300, an angle of rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410 may be provided to be smaller than an angle of rotation of the safety cover portion 450 with respect to the link portion 430. That is, the safety cover portion 450 may rotate about a larger angle as compared to rotation of the link portion 430 with respect to the base portion 410.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">Also, the first elastic portion 440 interposed in the first axial portion and the second elastic portion 460 interposed in the second axial portion may each include a spring (for example, a torsion spring).</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">As described above, referring to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the link portion 430 may have one end portion rotatably coupled to the base portion 410 through the first rotating shaft 434, and when the link portion 430 rotates in a first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) about the first rotating shaft 434, the link portion 430 may be moved to an outer side of the one end portion of the cylinder 200.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The first elastic portion 440 may be mounted on the first rotating shaft 434 and may provide an elastic force so that the link portion 430 rotates in the first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">Also, the safety cover portion 450 may have one end portion rotatably coupled to the link portion 430 through the second rotating shaft 452 and may rotate in the first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) about the second rotating shaft 452<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and cover the injection needle 300. That is, the first direction of rotation R1 may be a direction in which the safety cover portion 450 is uncoupled from the base portion 410 and in which the link portion 430 and the safety cover portion 450 are unfolded.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Also, the second elastic portion 460 may be mounted on the second rotating shaft 452 and may provide an elastic force so that the safety cover portion 450 rotates in the first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Therefore, in a state in which the safety cover portion 450 is coupled to the base portion 410, when a force is applied from the outside to uncouple the safety cover portion 450 and the base portion 410, the safety cover portion 450 rotates in the first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) due to the elastic force generated by the second elastic portion 460, and simultaneously, the link portion 430 rotates in the first direction of rotation R1 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) due to the elastic force generated by the first elastic portion 440.</p>
