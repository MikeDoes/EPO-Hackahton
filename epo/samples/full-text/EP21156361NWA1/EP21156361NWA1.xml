<heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy. In particular the present invention relates to novel recombinant chimeric polypeptides and polynucleotides derived from <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i> The invention further relates to vectors comprising the polynucleotides, transformed host organisms expressing the polynucleotides, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic uses and methods. Finally, also methods of preparation are part of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Bacterial infections are in most instances successfully treated by administration of antibiotics to patients in need thereof. However, due to careless or thoughtless use of powerful antibiotics, many pathological germs become resistant against antibiotics over time. One threatening example is <i>Staphyloccocus aureus.</i> In particular in hospitals this bacterium is of relevance. So-called Methicillin Resistant S. Aureus (MRSA) strains jeopardize patient's survival in hospitals, in particular after surgery.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Vaccination is considered to be a very effective method of preventing infectious diseases in human and veterinary health care. Vaccination is the administration of effective amounts of antigenic material (the vaccine) to produce immunity to a disease/disease-causing pathogenic agent. Vaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, the near eradication of polio, and the control of a variety of diseases, including rubella, measles, mumps, chickenpox, typhoid fever.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Before "the genomic era", vaccines were based on killed or live attenuated, microorganisms, or parts purified from them. Subunit vaccines are considered as a modern upgrade of these types of vaccine, as the subunit vaccines contain one or more protective antigens, which are more or less the weak spot of the pathogen. Hence, in order to develop subunit vaccines, it is critical to identify the proteins, which are important for inducing protection and to eliminate others.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">An antigen is said to be protective if it is able to induce protection from subsequent challenge by a disease-causing infectious agent in an appropriate animal model following immunization.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The empirical approach to subunit vaccine development, which includes several steps, begins with pathogen cultivation, followed by purification into components, and then testing of antigens for protection. Apart from being time and labour consuming, this approach has several limitations that can lead to failure. It is not possible to develop vaccines using this approach for microorganisms, which cannot easily be cultured and only allows for the identification of the antigens, which can be obtained in sufficient quantities. The empirical approach has a tendency to focus on the most abundant proteins, which in some cases are not immuno-protective. In other cases, the antigen expressed during <i>in vivo</i> infection is not expressed during <i>in vitro</i> cultivation. Furthermore, antigen discovery by use of the empirical approach demands an extreme amount of proteins in order to discover the protective antigens, which are like finding needles in the haystack. This renders it a very expensive approach, and it limits the vaccine development around diseases, which is caused by pathogens with a large genome or disease areas, which perform badly in a cost-effective perspective.</p>

<heading id="h0006">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h0007"><i>Definitions</i></heading>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The term "polypeptide" is in the present context intended to mean both short peptides of from 2 to 10 amino acid residues, oligopeptides of from 11 to 100 amino acid residues, and polypeptides of more than 100 amino acid residues. Furthermore, the term is also intended to include proteins, i.e. functional biomolecules comprising at least one polypeptide; when comprising at least two polypeptides, these may form complexes, be covalently linked, or may be non-covalently linked. The polypeptide (s) in a protein can be glycosylated and/or lipidated and/or comprise prosthetic groups.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The term "subsequence" means any consecutive stretch of at least 3 amino acids or, when relevant, of at least 3 nucleotides, derived directly from a reference amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence, respectively</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The term "amino acid sequence" is the order in which amino acid residues, connected by peptide bonds, lie in the chain in peptides and proteins.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The term "adjuvant" or "immunological adjuvant" has its usual meaning in the art of vaccine technology, i.e. a substance or a composition of matter which is 1) not in itself capable of mounting a specific immune response against the immunogen of the vaccine, but which is 2)<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> nevertheless capable of enhancing the immune response against the immunogen. Or, in other words, vaccination with the adjuvant alone does not provide an immune response against the immunogen, vaccination with the immunogen may or may not give rise to an immune response against the immunogen, but the combined vaccination with immunogen and adjuvant induces an immune response against the immunogen which is stronger than that induced by the immunogen alone.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">"Sequence identity" is in the context of the present invention determined by comparing 2 aligned sequences of equal length (e.g. DNA, RNA or amino acid) according to the following formula: (N<sub>ref</sub> - N<sub>dif</sub>)·100/N<sub>ref</sub>, wherein N<sub>ref</sub> is the number of residues in one of the 2 sequences and N<sub>dif</sub> is the number of residues which are non-identical in the two sequences when they are aligned over their entire lengths and in the same direction. So, two sequences 5'-ATTCGGAAC-3' and 5'- ATACGGGAC-3' will provide the sequence identity 77.78% (N<sub>ref</sub>=9 and N<sub>dif</sub>=2). It will be understood that such a sequence identity determination requires that the two aligned sequences are aligned so that there are no overhangs between the two sequences: each amino acid in each sequence will have to be matched with a counterpart in the other sequence.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">An "assembly of amino acids" means two or more amino acids bound together by physical or chemical means.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The "3D conformation" is the 3 dimensional structure of a biomolecule such as a protein. In monomeric polypeptides/proteins, the 3D conformation is also termed "the tertiary structure" and denotes the relative locations in 3 dimensional space of the amino acid residues forming the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">"An immunogenic carrier" is a molecule or moiety to which an immunogen or a hapten can be coupled in order to enhance or enable the elicitation of an immune response against the immunogen/hapten. Immunogenic carriers are in classical cases relatively large molecules (such as tetanus toxoid, KLH, diphtheria toxoid etc.) which can be fused or conjugated to an immunogen/hapten, which is not sufficiently immunogenic in its own right - typically, the immunogenic carrier is capable of eliciting a strong cellular immune response against the combined substance constituted by the immunogen and the immunogenic carrier, and this in turn provides for improved responses against the immunogen antibody producing cells and cytotoxic cells. More recently, the large carrier molecules have to a certain extent been substituted by so-called promiscuous epitopes, i.e. shorter peptides that are recognized by a large fraction of MHC-haplotypes in a population, and which elicit antigen specific cellular immune responses.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">An "immunogen" is a substance of matter which is capable of inducing an adaptive immune response in a host, whose immune system is exposed to the immunogen. As such, immunogens are a subset of the larger genus "antigens", which are substances that can be recognized specifically by the immune system but which are not necessarily capable of inducing immunity - an antigen is, however, always capable of <i>eliciting</i> immunity, meaning that a host that has an established memory immunity against the antigen will mount a specific immune response against the antigen.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">A "hapten" is a (typically) small molecule, which can neither induce nor elicit an immune response, but if conjugated to an immunogenic carrier, a specific adaptive immune response can be induced against a hapten upon exposure of the immune system with the hapten carrier conjugate.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">An "adaptive immune response" is an immune response in response to exposure to an antigen or immunogen, where the immune response is specific for antigenic determinants of the antigen/immunogen - examples of adaptive immune responses are induction of antigen specific antibody production or antigen specific induction/activation of cellular immune responses.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">A "protective, adaptive immune response" is an antigen-specific immune response induced in a subject as a reaction to immunization (artificial or natural) with an antigen, where the immune response is capable of protecting the subject against subsequent challenges with the antigen or a pathology-related agent that includes the antigen. Typically, prophylactic vaccination aims at establishing a protective adaptive immune response against one or several pathogens.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">"Stimulation of the immune system" means that a substance or composition of matter exhibits a general, non-specific immunostimulatory effect. A number of adjuvants and putative adjuvants (such as certain cytokines) share the ability to stimulate the immune system. The result of using an immunostimulating agent is an increased "alertness" of the immune system meaning that simultaneous or subsequent immunization with an immunogen induces a significantly more effective immune response compared to isolated use of the immunogen.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Hybridization under "stringent conditions" is herein defined as hybridization performed under conditions by which a probe will hybridize to its target sequence, to a detectably greater degree than to other sequences. Stringent conditions are target-sequence-dependent and will differ depending on the structure of the polynucleotide. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences can be identified which are 100%<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> complementary to a probe (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing). Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. Generally, stringent wash temperature conditions are selected to be about 5°C to about 2°C lower than the melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The melting point, or denaturation, of DNA occurs over a narrow temperature range and represents the disruption of the double helix into its complementary single strands. The process is described by the temperature of the midpoint of transition, Tm, which is also called the melting temperature. Formulas are available in the art for the determination of melting temperatures.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides composed of at least one antibody combining site. An "antibody combining site" is the three-dimensional binding space with an internal surface shape and charge distribution complementary to the features of an epitope of an antigen, which allows a binding of the antibody with the antigen. "Antibody" includes, for example, vertebrate antibodies, hybrid antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanised antibodies, altered antibodies, univalent antibodies, Fab proteins, and single domain antibodies.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">"Specific binding" denotes binding between two substances which goes beyond binding of either substance to randomly chosen substances and also goes beyond simple association between substances that tend to aggregate because they share the same overall hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. As such, specific binding usually involves a combination of electrostatic and other interactions between two conformationally complementary areas on the two substances, meaning that the substances can "recognize" each other in a complex mixture.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The term "vector" is used to refer to a carrier nucleic acid molecule into which a heterologous nucleic acid sequence can be inserted for introduction into a cell where it can be replicated and expressed. The term further denotes certain biological vehicles useful for the same purpose, e.g. viral and bacterial vectors - both these infectious agents are capable of introducing a heterologous nucleic acid sequence into a host and effect subsequence expression of a nucleic acid in the host.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The term "expression vector" refers to a vector containing a nucleic acid sequence coding for at least part of a gene product capable of being transcribed. In some cases, when the transcription product is an mRNA molecule, this is in turn translated into a protein, polypeptide, or peptide.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">A "chimeric polypeptide" is a polypeptide as defined above, which is constituted by amino acid stretches derived from at least two different proteins, where these at least two stretches are fused to each other, optionally via a linker. By nature, a chimeric polypeptide does not occur in nature.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">A "linker" or "peptide linker" is a stretch of amino acids that are interspersed between two peptides in a fusion polypeptide (such as a chimeric polypeptide). Linkers are widely used in recombinant biotechnology and are reviewed in<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text> Chen X et al. (2013), Advanced drug delivery reviews 65(10): 1357-1369. doi:10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.039</text></nplcit>. Typical linkers are flexible, meaning that they allow the joint polypeptides in a fusion construct to have a high degree of movement. Such flexible linkers are often rich in small, non-polar amino acid residues (such as glycine residues) but will often incorporate small polar amino acid residues such as serine or threonine residues, too. Such linkers are known as GS linkers.</p>

<p id="p0056" num="0056">The chimeric polypeptide of the second aspect of the invention focusses on inclusion of MHC Class II binding peptides derived from S. aureus into peptide constructs. As shown in the example below, the present inventors have identified 20 S. aureus derived peptides (SEQ ID NOs: 21-40) that exert binding to multiple MHC Class II molecules (DRB1<sup>∗</sup>01:01; DRB1<sup>∗</sup>04:01; and DRB5<sup>∗</sup>01:01), and these have been introduced into chimeric peptide constructs.

In other words, each of SEQ ID NOs 21-40 can be modified with up to 3 amino acid substitutions, thereby providing for features such as increased stability of binding to MHC Class II, broader population coverage, changed solubility in either water or organic solvents, and increased stability towards proteolytic breakdown.</p>

"Derivable from SEQ ID NO: 21-40" thus means that if an amino acid sequence can be defined by introducing 0, 1, 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions in a sequence selected from one of SEQ ID NOs: 21-40, then this amino acid sequence is derivable from that sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 21-40.</p>

Also the complimentary sequences are embraced by the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --></p>

<p id="p0068" num="0068">It will be understood that the nucleic acid fragments of the invention may be used for both production, carrier and vaccine purposes - the latter will require that the sequences are included in expression vectors that may lead to production of immunogenic proteins in the host animal receiving the vector.</p>
<heading id="h0011"><u>Fourth aspect - vectors of the invention</u></heading>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">It will be understood that the nucleic acid fragments of the invention may be used for both production, carrier and vaccine purposes - the latter will require that the sequences are included in expression vectors that may lead to production of immunogenic proteins in the mammal receiving the vector. Or put differently, the nucleic acid is comprised in a vector capable of expressing the nucleic acid in man upon administration.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">Such a vector of the invention often comprises in operable linkage and in the 5'-3' direction, an expression control region comprising an enhancer/promoter for driving expression of the nucleic acid, an optional signal peptide coding sequence, a nucleotide sequence of the invention, and optionally a terminator. Hence, such a vector constitutes an expression vector useful for effecting production in cells of the polypeptide of the invention. Since the polypeptides of the invention are protozoan of origin, recombinant production has to be effected in host cells that can express the coding nucleic acid. Bacterial host cells may be used. However, if the vector is to drive expression in eukaryotic cell (as would be the case for a nucleic acid vaccine vector), the expression control region should be adapted to this particular use.<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --></p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">For production purposes it is therefore often convenient that the expression control region drives expression in a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterium, e.g. in <i>E. coli,</i> or in a eukaryotic cell such as a plant cell, an insect cell, or a mammalian cell. For vaccine purposes, the expression control region has to be able to drive expression in a mammalian, preferably human, cell.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">Also, for production purposes, it is practical that the vector is capable of integrating the nucleic acid into the genome of a host cell - this is particularly useful if the vector is use in the production of stably transformed cells, where the progeny will also include the genetic information introduced via the vector. Alternatively, vectors incapable of being integrated into the genome of a piscine host cell are useful in e.g. nucleic acid vaccination.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">An interesting production system is the use of plants. For instance, proteins can be produced at low cost in plants using an Agrobacterium transfection system to genetically modify plants to express genes that encode the protein of interest. One commercially available platform are those provided by iBio CMO LLC (8800 HSC Pkwy, Bryan, TX 77807, USA) and iBio, Inc (9 Innovatoin Way, Suite 100, Newark, DE 19711, USA) and disclosed in e.g. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP2853599A"><text>EP 2 853 599</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP1769068A"><text>EP 1 769 068</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="EP2192172A"><text>EP 2 192 172</text></patcit>.

<p id="p0074" num="0074">The vector is typically selected from the group consisting of a virus, such as a virus which is non-pathogenic in mammals and in particular in humans, a bacterium such as a bacterium which is non-pathogenic in mammals such as humans, a plasmid, a minichromosome, and a cosmid.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">Interesting vectors are viral vectors (in particular those useful as vaccine agents in humans). These may be selected from the group consisting of a retrovirus vector, such as a lentivirus vector, an adenovirus vector, an adeno-associated virus vector, and a pox virus vector. Certain pox virus vectors are preferred, in particular vaccinia virus vectors. A particularly preferred vaccinia virus vector is a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Polypeptides of the invention may as indicated be encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprised in a vector. A nucleic acid sequence can be "heterologous," which means that it is in a context foreign to the cell in which the vector is being introduced, which includes a sequence homologous to a sequence in the cell but in a position within the host cell where it is ordinarily not found.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">Vectors include naked DNAs, RNAs, plasmids, cosmids, viruses (bacteriophage, animal viruses, and plant viruses), and artificial chromosomes (e.g., YACs). One of skill in the art<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> would be well equipped to construct a vector through standard recombinant techniques. In addition to encoding the polypeptides of this invention, a vector of the present invention may encode polypeptide sequences such as a "tag" or immunogenicity enhancing peptide (e.g. an immunogenic carrier or a fusion partner that stimulates the immune system, such as a cytokine or active fragment thereof). Useful vectors encoding such fusion proteins include pIN vectors, vectors encoding a stretch of histidines, and pGEX vectors, for use in generating glutathione S-transferase (GST) soluble fusion proteins for later purification and separation or cleavage.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">Vectors of the invention may be used in a host cell to produce a polypeptide of the invention that may subsequently be purified for administration or the vector may be purified for direct administration for expression of the protein (as is the case when administering a nucleic acid vaccine).</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">Expression vectors can contain a variety of "control sequences," which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. In addition to control sequences that govern transcription and translation, vectors and expression vectors may contain nucleic acid sequences that serve other functions as well and are described <i>infra.</i></p>
<heading id="h0012">1. Promoters and Enhancers</heading>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">A "promoter" is a control sequence. The promoter is typically a region of a nucleic acid sequence at which initiation and rate of transcription are controlled. It may contain genetic elements at which regulatory proteins and molecules may bind such as RNA polymerase and other transcription factors. The phrases "operatively positioned," "operatively linked," "under control," and "under transcriptional control" mean that a promoter is in a correct functional location and/or orientation in relation to a nucleic acid sequence to control transcriptional initiation and expression of that sequence. A promoter may or may not be used in conjunction with an "enhancer," which refers to a cis-acting regulatory sequence involved in the transcriptional activation of a nucleic acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">A promoter may be one naturally associated with a gene or sequence, as may be obtained by isolating the 5' non-coding sequences located upstream of the coding segment or exon. Such a promoter can be referred to as "endogenous." Similarly, an enhancer may be one naturally associated with a nucleic acid sequence, located either downstream or upstream of that sequence. Alternatively, certain advantages will be gained by positioning the coding nucleic acid segment under the control of a recombinant or heterologous promoter, which refers to a promoter that is not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> environment. A recombinant or heterologous enhancer refers also to an enhancer not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural state. Such promoters or enhancers may include promoters or enhancers of other genes, and promoters or enhancers isolated from any other prokaryotic, viral, or eukaryotic cell, and promoters or enhancers not "naturally occurring," i.e., containing different elements of different transcriptional regulatory regions, and/or mutations that alter expression. In addition to producing nucleic acid sequences of promoters and enhancers synthetically, sequences may be produced using recombinant cloning and/or nucleic acid amplification technology, including polymerase chain reaction in connection with the compositions disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">It may be important to employ a promoter and/or enhancer that effectively direct(s) the expression of the DNA segment in the cell type or organism chosen for expression. Those of skill in the art of molecular biology generally know the use of promoters, enhancers, and cell type combinations for protein expression. The promoters employed may be constitutive, tissue-specific, or inducible and in certain embodiments may direct high level expression of the introduced DNA segment under specified conditions, such as large-scale production of recombinant proteins or peptides.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">Examples of inducible elements, which are regions of a nucleic acid sequence that can be activated in response to a specific stimulus, include but are not limited to Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain, Immunoglobulin Light Chain, T Cell Receptor, HLA DQa and/or DQβ, β-Interferon, Interleukin-2, Interleukin-2 Receptor, MHC Class II 5, MHC Class II HLA-DRa, β-Actin, Muscle Creatine Kinase (MCK), Prealbumin (Transthyretin), Elastase I, Metallothionein (MTII), Collagenase, Albumin, α-Fetoprotein, γ-Globin, β-Gtobin, c-fos, c-HA-ras, Insulin, Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM), αl-Antitrypain, H2B (TH2B) Histone, Mouse and/or Type I Collagen, Glucose-Regulated Proteins (GRP94 and GRP78), Rat Growth Hormone, Human Serum Amyloid A (SAA), Troponin I (TN I), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, SV40, Polyoma, Retroviruses, Papilloma Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE, and Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus.</p>

Additionally any promoter/enhancer combination (as per the Eukaryotic Promoter Data Base EPDB) could also be used to drive expression of structural genes encoding oligosaccharide processing enzymes, protein folding accessory proteins, selectable marker proteins or a heterologous protein of interest.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">The particular promoter that is employed to control the expression of peptide or protein encoding polynucleotide of the invention is not believed to be critical, so long as it is capable of expressing the polynucleotide in a targeted cell. Where a piscine cell is targeted (as is the case in nucleic acid vaccination), it is preferable to position the polynucleotide coding region adjacent to and under the control of a promoter that is capable of being expressed in a piscine cell. Generally speaking, such a promoter might include either a bacterial, piscine or viral promoter as long as the promoter is effective in piscine cells.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">In various embodiments - in particular those where recombinant production of the polypeptide of the invention is the aim - the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early gene promoter, the SV40 early promoter, and the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used to obtain high level expression of a related polynucleotide to this invention. The use of other viral or mammalian cellular or bacterial phage promoters, which are well known in the art, to achieve expression of polynucleotides is contemplated as well.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">In embodiments in which a vector is administered to humans for expression of the protein, it is contemplated that a desirable promoter for use with the vector is one that is not down-regulated by cytokines or one that is strong enough that even if down-regulated, it produces an effective amount of the protein/polypeptide of the current invention in humans to elicit an immune response. Non-limiting examples of these are CMV IE and RSV LTR. In other embodiments, a promoter that is up-regulated in the presence of cytokines is employed. The MHC I promoter increases expression in the presence of IFN-y.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Tissue specific promoters can be used, particularly if expression is in cells in which expression of an antigen is desirable, such as dendritic cells and macrophages.

<heading id="h0013">2. Initiation Signals and Internal Ribosome Binding Sites (IRES)</heading>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">A specific initiation signal also may be required for efficient translation of coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon or adjacent sequences. Exogenous translational control signals, including the ATG initiation codon, may need to be provided.<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> One of ordinary skill in the art would readily be capable of determining this and providing the necessary signals. It is well known that the initiation codon must be "in-frame" with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. The exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be either natural or synthetic and may be operable in bacteria or mammalian cells. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">In certain embodiments of the invention, the use of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) elements are used to create multigene, or polycistronic, messages. IRES elements are able to bypass the ribosome scanning model of 5' methylated Cap dependent translation and begin translation at internal sites. IRES elements from two members of the picornavirus family (polio and encephalomyocarditis) have been described, as well an IRES from a mammalian message. IRES elements can be linked to heterologous open reading frames. Multiple open reading frames can be transcribed together, each separated by an IRES, creating polycistronic messages. By virtue of the IRES element, each open reading frame is accessible to ribosomes for efficient translation. Multiple genes can be efficiently expressed using a single promoter/enhancer to transcribe a single message (see <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US5925565A"><text>U.S. Patents 5,925,565</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US5935819A"><text>5,935,819</text></patcit>, herein incorporated by reference).</p>
<heading id="h0014">3. Multiple Cloning Sites</heading>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">Vectors can include a multiple cloning site (MCS), which is a nucleic acid region that contains multiple restriction enzyme sites, any of which can be used in conjunction with standard recombinant technology to digest the vector. Frequently, a vector is linearized or fragmented using a restriction enzyme that cuts within the MCS to enable exogenous sequences to be ligated to the vector. Techniques involving restriction enzymes and ligation reactions are well known to those of skill in the art of recombinant technology.</p>
<heading id="h0015">4. Splicing Sites</heading>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Most transcribed eukaryotic RNA molecules will undergo RNA splicing to remove introns from the primary transcripts. If relevant in the context of vectors of the present invention, vectors containing genomic eukaryotic sequences may require donor and/or acceptor splicing sites to ensure proper processing of the transcript for protein expression.</p>
<heading id="h0016">5. Termination Signals</heading>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">The vectors or constructs of the present invention will generally comprise at least one termination signal. A "termination signal" or "terminator" is comprised of the DNA sequences<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> involved in specific termination of an RNA transcript by an RNA polymerase. Thus, in certain embodiments a termination signal that ends the production of an RNA transcript is contemplated. A terminator may be necessary <i>in vivo</i> to achieve desirable message levels.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">In eukaryotic systems, the terminator region may also comprise specific DNA sequences that permit site-specific cleavage of the new transcript so as to expose a polyadenylation site. This signals a specialized endogenous polymerase to add a stretch of about 200 A residues (poly A) to the 3' end of the transcript. RNA molecules modified with this polyA tail appear to more stable and are translated more efficiently. Thus, in other embodiments involving eukaryotes, it is preferred that that terminator comprises a signal for the cleavage of the RNA, and it is more preferred that the terminator signal promotes polyadenylation of the message.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">Terminators contemplated for use in the invention include any known terminator of transcription described herein or known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to, for example, the bovine growth hormone terminator or viral termination sequences, such as the SV40 terminator. In certain embodiments, the termination signal may be a lack of transcribable or translatable sequence, such as due to a sequence truncation.</p>
<heading id="h0017">6. Polyadenylation Signals</heading>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">In expression, particularly eukaryotic expression (as is relevant in nucleic acid vaccination), one will typically include a polyadenylation signal to effect proper polyadenylation of the transcript. The nature of the polyadenylation signal is not believed to be crucial to the successful practice of the invention, and/or any such sequence may be employed. Preferred embodiments include the SV40 polyadenylation signal and/or the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal, convenient and/or known to function well in various target cells. Polyadenylation may increase the stability of the transcript or may facilitate cytoplasmic transport.</p>
<heading id="h0018">7. Origins of Replication</heading>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">In order to propagate a vector in a host cell, it may contain one or more origins of replication sites (often termed "on"), which is a specific nucleic acid sequence at which replication is initiated. Alternatively an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) can be employed if the host cell is yeast.</p>
<heading id="h0019">8. Selectable and Screenable Markers</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="54"> -->
<p id="p0099" num="0099">In certain embodiments of the invention, cells containing a nucleic acid construct of the present invention may be identified in vitro or in vivo by encoding a screenable or selectable marker in the expression vector. When transcribed and translated, a marker confers an identifiable change to the cell permitting easy identification of cells containing the expression vector. Generally, a selectable marker is one that confers a property that allows for selection. A positive selectable marker is one in which the presence of the marker allows for its selection, while a negative selectable marker is one in which its presence prevents its selection. An example of a positive selectable marker is a drug resistance marker.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">Usually the inclusion of a drug selection marker aids in the cloning and identification of transformants, for example, markers that confer resistance to neomycin, puromycin, hygromycin, DHFR, GPT, zeocin or histidinol are useful selectable markers. In addition to markers conferring a phenotype that allows for the discrimination of transformants based on the implementation of conditions, other types of markers including screenable markers such as GFP for colorimetric analysis. Alternatively, screenable enzymes such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) may be utilized. One of skill in the art would also know how to employ immunologic markers that can be used in conjunction with FACS analysis. The marker used is not believed to be important, so long as it is capable of being expressed simultaneously with the nucleic acid encoding a protein of the invention. Further examples of selectable and screenable markers are well known to one of skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p0105" num="0105">Eukaryotic cells can be in the form of yeasts (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and protozoans. Alternatively, the transformed eukaryotic cells are derived from a multicellular organism such as a fungus, an insect cell, a plant cell, or a mammalian cell.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">For production purposes, it is advantageous that the transformed cell of the invention is is stably transformed by having the nucleic acid defined above for option i) stably integrated into its genome, and in certain embodiments it is also preferred that the transformed cell secretes or carries on its surface the polypeptide of the invention, since this facilitates recovery of the polypeptides produced.

All of these terms also include their progeny, which includes any and all subsequent generations. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical due to deliberate or<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> inadvertent mutations. In the context of expressing a heterologous nucleic acid sequence, "host cell" refers to a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, and it includes any transformable organism that is capable of replicating a vector or expressing a heterologous gene encoded by a vector. A host cell can, and has been, used as a recipient for vectors or viruses. A host cell may be "transfected" or "transformed," which refers to a process by which exogenous nucleic acid, such as a recombinant protein-encoding sequence, is transferred or introduced into the host cell.

An appropriate host can be determined by one of skill in the art based on the vector backbone and the desired result. A plasmid or cosmid, for example, can be introduced into a prokaryote host cell for replication of many vectors or expression of encoded proteins. Bacterial cells used as host cells for vector replication and/or expression include <i>Staphylococcus</i> strains, DH5a, JMI 09, and KC8, as well as a number of commercially available bacterial hosts such as SURE(R) Competent Cells and SOLOP ACK(TM) Gold Cells (STRATAGENE®, La Jolla, CA).

Alum and MF59™ adjuvants are preferred together with CFA and IFA.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">As mentioned above, muramyl peptides include, but are not limited to, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-normuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (nor-MDP),<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl- L-alanine-2"-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (MTP-PE), etc.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">Another possibility for a polypeptide vaccine formulation is to include the vaccine polypeptide(s) of the present invention in a virus-like particle, i.e. a non-infectious self-assembling structure composed of envelope or capsid proteins, where the protein(s) of the invention are incorporated. The effect is multiple presentations of the polypeptides of the invention on the surface of the VLP, which in turn provides for improved immune recognition of the polypeptides. Hence, VLPs exert immunological adjuvant effects, too.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">The immunogenic compositions (e.g. the immunising antigen or immunogen or polypeptide or protein or nucleic acid, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and adjuvant) typically will contain diluents, such as water, saline, glycerol, ethanol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such vehicles.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">Typically, the immunogenic compositions are prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared. The preparation also may be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes for enhanced adjuvant effect, as discussed above under pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">Immunogenic compositions used as vaccines comprise an immunologically effective amount of the antigenic or immunogenic polypeptides, as well as any other of the above-mentioned components, as needed. By "immunologically effective amount", it is meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (eg. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesize antibodies or generally mount an immune response, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount of immunogen will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. However, for the purposes of protein vaccination, the amount administered per immunization is typically in the range between 0.5 µg and 500 mg (however, often not higher than 5,000 µg). The amount of polypeptide of the invention can therefore be between 1 and 400 µg, between 2 and 350 µg, between 4 and 300 µg, between 5 and 250 µg, and between 10 and 200 µg. Hence, the composition will typically contain between 0.1-500 µg of protein of the invention per g of vaccine composition.<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --></p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">The immunogenic compositions are conventionally administered parenterally, eg, by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or transdermally/transcutaneously (eg. <patcit id="pcit0040" dnum="WO9820734A"><text>WO98/20734</text></patcit>). Additional formulations suitable for other modes of administration include oral and pulmonary formulations, suppositories, and transdermal applications. In the case of nucleic acid vaccination, also the intravenous or intraarterial routes may be applicable.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. The vaccine may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">As an alternative to protein-based vaccines, DNA vaccination (also termed nucleic acid vaccination or gene vaccination) may be used [eg. <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="b"><text>Robinson &amp; Torres (1997) Seminars in Immunol 9: 271-283</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Donnelly et al.

<p id="p0136" num="0136">A further aspect of the invention is as mentioned above the recognition that combination vaccines can be provided, wherein 2 or more chimeric polypeptide antigens disclosed herein are combined to enhance the immune response by the vaccinated individueal, including to optimize initial immune response and duration of immunity. For the purposes of this aspect of the invention, multiple antigenic fragments derived from the same, longer protein can also be used, such as the use of a combination of different lengths of polypeptide sequence fragments from one protein.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">Thus, embodiments of the invention relate to a composition (or the use as a vaccine thereof) comprising 2 distinct (i.e. non-identical) proteinaceous immunogens disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h0024"><u>Immunization methods</u></heading>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">The method of this aspect of the invention generally relates to induction of immunity and as such also entails methods that are prophylactic as well as therapeutic.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">When immunization methods entail that a chimeric polypeptide of the invention or a composition comprising such a chimeric polypeptide is administered the animal (e.g. the human) typically receives between 0.5 and 5,000 µg of the polypeptide of the invention per administration, cf. the above indications concerning dosages.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">In preferred embodiments, the immunization scheme includes that the a primary administration of the chimeric polypeptide(s), the nucleic acids/vectore, or the composition(s) of the invention, but it may be necessary to follow up with one or more booster administrations.<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --></p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Preferred embodiments comprise that the administration is for the purpose of inducing protective immunity against <i>S.aureus.</i> In this embodiment it is particularly preferred that the protective immunity is effective in reducing the risk of attracting infection with <i>S.aureus.</i></p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">As mentioned herein, the some vaccines of the invention induce humoral immunity, so it is preferred that the administration is for the purpose of inducing antibodies specific for <i>S aureus.</i></p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">But, as also mentioned the immunization method may also be useful in antibody production, so in other embodiments the administration is for the purpose of inducing antibodies specific for <i>S. aureus</i> wherein B-lymphocytes producing said antibodies are subsequently recovered from the animal and used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">Compositions for immunization can as mentioned above comprise polypeptides, nucleic acids, or vectors of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions will comprise a therapeutically effective amount thereof.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "prophylactically effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent to treat, ameliorate, or prevent a desired disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable preventative effect in a group of mammals such as humans The effect can be detected by, for example, chemical markers or antigen levels. Reference is made to the ranges for dosages of immunologically effective amounts of polypeptides, cf. above. However, the effective amount for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation and is within the judgement of the clinician.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">For purposes of the present invention, an effective dose will be from about 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of the DNA constructs in the animal to which it is administered.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">A pharmaceutical composition can also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent, such as antibodies or a polypeptide, genes, and other therapeutic agents. The term refers to any pharmaceutical carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity. Suitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and inactive virus particles. Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --></p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used therein, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, and the like; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, and the like.

<p id="p0149" num="0149">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such vehicles. Typically, the therapeutic compositions are prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared. Liposomes are included within the definition of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<heading id="h0025">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<heading id="h0026"><i>Identification of amino acid sequences binding to MHC Class II molecules</i></heading>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">A number of 15-mer peptides were initially identified in silico from the S. aureus proteomes. Also, a number of putative scaffold proteins were identified, leaving out potentially toxic or otherwise harmful scaffold proteins. The initial 15-mer peptides were selected based on the probability that they would bind several MHC Class II allelic variants and also based on their degree of non-similarity with the human proteome. Finally, each 15-mer was mapped to a proteome and evaluated relative to normalized expression data of the proteome member in S. aureus. The total number of 15-mer peptides selected was 50.</p>
<p id="p0151" num="0151">The 50 selected peptides were subsequently tested in vitro for MHC Class II binding:<br/>
As the peptide:MHCII complex stability has been proven to be the main driver of immunogenicity, the 50 selected epitopes were subjected to analysis by Immunitrack (Biocenter of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark) by measuring the stability of the peptide:DRB1<sup>∗</sup>01:01 complex, the peptide:DRB1<sup>∗</sup>04:01 complex, and the peptide:DRB5<sup>∗</sup>01:01 complex.</p>
<p id="p0152" num="0152">12 out the 50 tested peptides did not form complexes with one or more of the 3 alleles. From the remaining 38 epitopes <u>20</u> (SEQ ID NOs: 21-40) were categorized as forming stable or very stable complexes with all 3 alleles and were used for building epitope constructs.<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --></p>
<p id="p0153" num="0153">Finally the 9 epitopes having SEQ ID NOs: 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 38, and 40, and the 11 epitopes having SEQ ID NOs: 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 35-37, and 39 were compiled into multiple different constructs using either an epitope on a string strategy (epitope-linker-epitope-...-) or by replacing known epitopes in the NCBI 53721566 protein with the nearest (in BLOSUM space) identified S. aureus epitope.</p>
<p id="p0154" num="0154">The constructs were finally submitted to 3 different solubility prediction servers and the 4 most soluble constructs were ordered from Genscript. The amino acid sequences of the resulting chimeric proteins are set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 41-44 (41 and 42 are "epitopes on a string" constructs, 43 and 44 are "epitopes in scaffold" constructs). For recombinant production, a start codon encoded Met was introduced in the N-terminus of the epitope on a string constructs (not shown in the SEQ ID NOs: 41 and 42).</p>
<p id="p0155" num="0155">Hence, 4 S. aureus T-helper cell epitope constructs were developed. Formalized together with the adjuvant CAF01 (<nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Agger EM et al.

An evident improvement in clinical status of the protein immunized animals was noticed up to D52, as revealed by the statistically significant increases in body weights in CHIM_Hla_2753_FS* and CHIM_Hla_0735_FS immunized groups on D52.</p>
<p id="p0201" num="0201">Immunization with Hla_H35L-27-319, CHIM_Hla_2753_FS or CHIM_Hla_0735_FS as single protein formulations resulted in statistically significant protection against <i>S. aureus</i> USA300<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> induced skin abscess formation, when compared to the CAF01 adjuvant control, as revealed by the abscess areas measured during the 10 day period following SC challenge.</p>
<p id="p0202" num="0202">Single protein immunization with SAR2635-1-199 demonstrated no protective effect against <i>S. aureus</i> USA300 induced skin abscess formation, when compared to the CAF01 adjuvant control group, since mean abscess areas measured during the 10 day period following SC challenge were similar between these two groups. However, it should be noted that the group immunized with SAR2635-1-199 included only 11 mice in the abscess measurements since 5 mice had died during the course of the experiment (either during the challenge preparation phase or following the challenge).</p>
<p id="p0203" num="0203">In conclusion, subcutaneous vaccination with Hla_H35L-27-319, CHIM_Hla_2753_FS or CHIM_Hla_0735_FS as single protein formulations exhibited protective effect against <i>S. aureus</i> USA300 subcutaneous skin abscess formation in female BALB/c mice.
