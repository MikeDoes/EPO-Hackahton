<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of surge protective devices, and specifically discloses an SPD plug-in module, an SPD base and a plug-in SPD.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">A voltage-limiting surge protective device (SPD) is mainly assembled by passive electronic components, chips of metal oxide varistors (MOV, zinc oxide varistors), and has a special nonlinear volt-ampere characteristic, that is, a nonlinear relationship between current and voltage, which is generally characterized by a nonlinearity parameter. In the case of abnormal conditions, such as lightning strikes, electromagnetic field interference, frequent switching of power supply, power system failures, or the like, the voltage on the line increases suddenly and exceeds the conduction voltage of an SPD, the SPD will enter the conduction zone. In this case, the nonlinearity parameter can reach tens or hundreds, and the impedance of the SPD will be low, only a few ohms, so that the overvoltage will form a surge current to flow out, thereby protecting connected electronic products or expensive components.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">At present, a plug-in SPD is mainly composed of a plug-in base and a plug-in module. The plug-in module is mainly used to install the SPD chip, and the plug-in base is mainly used to connect to the power line. When abnormal conditions occur, the SPD chip and its electrode pins are separated, and the plug-in module needs to be replaced. At present, there are still some problems in the current plug-in modules and plug-in bases, such as inaccurate and unreliable in physical design, difficult in assembly, and error-prone during assembly, affected abilities of the MOV chip by unreasonable structure, and high overall costs.</p>

<p id="p0020" num="0020">Hereafter, the implementation of the present invention will be clearly and completely described with reference to accompanying drawings. Embodiments are set forth for illustrative purposes only and should not be understood as limiting the present invention. The accompanying drawings are for reference and illustrative purposes only, and do not limit the scope of protection of the present invention, because many changes can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h0006">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Refer to the stereogram of <figref idref="f0001">FIG.1</figref> and the exploded view of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. An SPD plug-in module A according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a rectangular outer shell A1 and an internal assembly A2 which is drawn into the rectangular outer shell A1 from the bottom opening of the rectangular outer shell A1.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, as shown in Table 1 below, one end of a top surface of the rectangular outer shell A1 is provided with a window A1-1, upper portions of two side surfaces of the rectangular outer shell A1 are each provided with a rough surface A1-2 (i.e., an anti-skid structure A10), horizontal grooves A1-3 (i.e., first plugging locking structures A11) are provided below the rough surfaces A1-2,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and clasping holes A1-4 (i.e., internal assembly fixing structures A12) are provided below the horizontal grooves A1-3. Four vertical grooves A1-5 (i.e., first guiding plugging structures A13) extending from bottoms of two side surfaces of the SPD plug-in module A are provided for guiding the SPD plug-in module to be plugged in a SPD base. Two vertical grooves A1-5 on one side surface have different heights and can also prevent improper plugging. As shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, an inner side of one side surface of the rectangular outer shell A1 (corresponding to the anti-skid structure A10) is provided with a mis-installation-proof short protrusion A1-6 (i.e., a mis-installation-proof structure A14).

<li>The second guiding plugging structures B12 are arranged on the upper bottom shell B1 to guide the SPD plug-in module A to plug in smoothly; if the first guiding plugging structures A13 of the SPD plug-in module A are configured as different vertical grooves A1-5, the second guiding plugging structures are configured as vertical guide pieces B1-1 with corresponding heights to achieve reverse assembly-proof;</li>
<li>The upper bottom shell B1 is correspondingly provided with a plurality of through holes for the electrode pins (the first leading-out pin A2-43 and the second leading-out pin A2-53) and the identification pile of the SPD plug-in module A, external power lines, and the remote communication interface 7 passing through, thereby meeting actual needs;</li>
<li>Elastic pins B1-9 used to receive the electrode pins of the SPD plug-in module are configured to be detachable, so that elastic pins B1-9 of different materials can be replaced or elastic force of the elastic pins B1-9 can be adjusted so as to meet different requirements on tightness of plugging-in and plugging-out;</li>
<li>The upper and lower bottom shells (B1, B2) are integrally formed, and the internal space is strictly divided into multiple preset spaces (S1 to S3); the first wiring assembly 4, the second wiring assembly 5, the alarm component 6 (and the remote communication interface 7) are placed at corresponding positions of the upper bottom shell B1 (or the lower bottom shell B2), then the upper and lower bottom shells are closed and riveting tubes B1-11 are plugged in to complete assembly, which has the advantages of accurate positioning, convenient assembly and reliable structure;</li>
<li>The corresponding internal space and openings only need to be designed for the upper and lower bottom shells (B1, B2) when the mold is opened, and then they can be integrated, so that the product is simple and pretty, easy to assemble, and has a reliable structure, and costs are controlled effectively.</li>
