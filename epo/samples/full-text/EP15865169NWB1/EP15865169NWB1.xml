<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of catheter systems for performing therapeutic procedures and in particular, to a catheter procedure system for navigating a guide wire.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Vascular disease, and in particular cardiovascular disease, may be treated in a variety of ways. Surgery, such as cardiac bypass surgery, is one method for treating cardiovascular disease. However, under certain circumstances, vascular disease may be treated with a catheter based intervention procedure, such as angioplasty. Catheter based intervention procedures are generally considered less invasive than some other types of procedures. If a patient shows symptoms indicative of cardiovascular disease, an image of the patient's heart may be taken to aid in the diagnosis of the patient's disease and to determine an appropriate course of treatment. For certain disease types, such as atherosclerosis, the image of the patient's heart may show a lesion that is blocking one or more coronary arteries. Following the diagnostic procedure, the patient may undergo a catheter based intervention procedure. During one type of intervention procedure, a guide wire is inserted into a blood vessel in the patient's body. The guide wire is then advanced to the desired location, most commonly in one of the heart vessels or elsewhere in the vascular system. A catheter is then slid over the guide wire and moved through the patient's arterial system until the catheter reaches the site of the lesion. In some procedures, the catheter is equipped with a balloon or a stent that when deployed at the site of a lesion allows for increased blood flow through the portion of the coronary artery that is affected by the lesion. In addition to cardiovascular disease, other diseases (e.g., hypertension, etc.) may be treated using catheterization procedures.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">For manual insertion of a guide wire, the physician applies torque and axial push force on the proximal end of a guide wire to effect tip direction and axial advancement at<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the distal end. Robotic catheter systems have been developed that may be used to aid a physician in performing a catheterization procedure such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The physician uses a robotic system to precisely steer a coronary guide wire and balloon/stent device in order to, for example, widen an obstructed artery. In order to perform PCI, the distal tip of a guide wire must be navigated through coronary anatomy past a target lesion. While observing the coronary anatomy using fluoroscopy, the physician manipulates the proximal end of the guide wire in order to direct the distal tip into the appropriate vessels toward the lesion and avoid advancing into side branches. Due to the limitations of fluoroscopy, poor visualization, a lack of depth perception and compliance of the anatomy and the guide wire, it can be difficult to rotate the proximal end of the guide wire and precisely direct its distal tip to the desired location.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">It would be desirable to provide a system for navigating a guide wire that may reduce the amount of time needed to navigate past a junction point thereby reducing the overall procedure time.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2010331670A"><text>US2010/331670</text></patcit> describes a system for guiding a catheter through a lumen system of a body of a patient, to a predetermined location within the lumen system. The system includes a medical positioning system, a moving mechanism coupled with the catheter, and a controller coupled with the medical positioning system and with the moving mechanism. The medical positioning system includes at least one position detector, the position detector being firmly attached to a distal portion of the catheter. The medical positioning system determines the position of the position detector, and the controller controls the operation of the moving mechanism to move the catheter to the predetermined location, according to the position and according to a topological representation of at least a portion of the lumen system.</p>
<heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">We describe herein a method, not being part of the present invention, for navigating a guide wire during a catheter procedure that includes advancing a guide wire through a path using a catheter procedure system, determining if the guide wire is in a desired path based at least on at least one image of a region of interest, rotating the guide wire using the catheter procedure system if the guide wire is not in the desired path, wherein the guide wire is rotated a predetermined amount, retracting the guide wire using the catheter procedure system, repeating the steps of advancing the guide wire and rotating and retracting the guide wire using the catheter procedure system until the guide wire is in the desired<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> path and advancing the guide wire to a desired position using the catheter procedure system.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Another example method, not being part of the present invention, for navigating a guide wire during a catheter procedure includes receiving a set of parameters defining a predetermined path, automatically advancing a guide wire through the predetermined path using a catheter procedure system, determining if the guide wire is in the predetermined path based at least on at least one image of a region of interest, rotating the guide wire using the catheter procedure system if the guide wire is not in the predetermined path, wherein the guide wire is rotated a predetermined amount, retracting the guide wire using the catheter procedure system, repeating the steps of advancing the guide wire and retracting and rotating the guide wire using the catheter procedure system until the guide wire is in the predetermined path and advancing the guide wire to a desired position using the catheter procedure system.</p>

<heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Before turning to the figures, which illustrate the exemplary embodiments in detail, it should be understood that the present application is not limited to the details or methodology set forth in the description or illustrated in the figures. It should also be understood that the terminology is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a catheter procedure system 10 is shown. Catheter procedure system 10 may be used to perform catheter based medical procedures (e.g., percutaneous intervention procedures). Percutaneous intervention procedures may include diagnostic catheterization procedures during which one or more catheters are used to aid in the diagnosis of a patient's disease. For example, during one embodiment of a catheter based diagnostic procedure, a contrast media is injected into one or more coronary arteries through a catheter and an image of the patient's heart is taken. Percutaneous intervention<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> procedures may also include catheter based therapeutic procedures (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent placement, treatment of peripheral vascular disease, etc.) during which a catheter is used to treat a disease. It should be noted, however, that one skilled in the art would recognize that, certain specific percutaneous intervention devices or components (e.g., type of guide wire, type of catheter, etc.) will be selected based on the type of procedure that is to be performed. Catheter procedure system 10 is capable of performing any number of catheter based medical procedures with minor adjustments to accommodate the specific percutaneous devices to be used in the procedure. In particular, while the embodiments of catheter procedure system 10 described herein are explained primarily in relation to the diagnosis and/or treatment of coronary disease, catheter procedure system 10 may be used to diagnose and/or treat any type of disease or condition amenable to diagnosis and/or treatment via a catheter based procedure. For example, catheter procedure system 10 may be used for the treatment of hypertension utilizing a radiofrequency emitting catheter to deactivate certain nerves that enervate the kidneys to control hypertension.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Catheter procedure system 10 includes lab unit 11 and workstation 14. Catheter procedure system 10 includes a robotic catheter system, shown as bedside system 12, located within lab unit 11 adjacent patient 21. Generally, bedside system 12 may be equipped with the appropriate percutaneous devices (e.g., guide wires, guide catheters, working catheters, catheter balloons, stents, diagnostic catheters, etc.) or other components (e.g., contrast media, medicine, etc.) to allow the user to perform a catheter based medical procedure. A robotic catheter system, such as bedside system 12, may be any system configured to allow a user to perform a catheter-based medical procedure via a robotic system by operating various controls such as the controls located at workstation 14. Bedside system 12 may include any number and/or combination of components to provide bedside system 12 with the functionality described herein. Various embodiments of bedside system 12 are described in detail in P.C.T. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2009042720W" dnum-type="L"><text>International Application No. PCT/US2009/042720, filed May 4, 2009</text></patcit>, published as <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2009137410A"><text>WO2009137410</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped to perform a catheter based diagnostic procedure. In this embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with one or more of a variety of catheters for the delivery of contrast media to the coronary arteries. In one embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with a first catheter shaped to deliver contrast media to the coronary arteries on the left side of the heart, a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> second catheter shaped to deliver contrast media to the coronary arteries on the right side of the heart, and a third catheter shaped to deliver contrast media into the chambers of the heart.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In another embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped to perform a catheter based therapeutic procedure. In this embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with a guide catheter, a guide wire, and a working catheter (e.g., a balloon catheter, a stent delivery catheter, ablation catheter, etc.). In one embodiment, bedside system 12 may equipped with a working catheter that includes a secondary lumen that is threaded over the guide wire during a procedure. In another embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with an over-the-wire working catheter that includes a central lumen that is threaded over the guide wire during a procedure. In another embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter. In another embodiment, any of the percutaneous devices of bedside system 12 may be equipped with positional sensors that indicate the position of the component within the body.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Bedside system 12 is in communication with workstation 14, allowing signals generated by the user inputs and/or control system of workstation 14 to be transmitted to bedside system 12 to control the various functions of beside system 12. Bedside system 12 also may provide feedback signals (e.g., operating conditions, warning signals, error codes, etc.) to workstation 14. Bedside system 12 may be connected to workstation 14 via a communication link 38 that may be a wireless connection, cable connectors, or any other means capable of allowing communication to occur between workstation 14 and beside system 12.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Workstation 14 includes a user interface 30. User interface 30 includes controls 16. Controls 16 allow the user to control bedside system 12 to perform a catheter based medical procedure. For example, controls 16 may be configured to cause bedside system 12 to perform various tasks using the various percutaneous devices with which bedside system 12 may be equipped (e.g., to advance, retract, or rotate a guide wire, advance, retract, or rotate a working catheter, advance, retract, or rotate a guide catheter, inflate or deflate a balloon located on a catheter, position and/or deploy a stent, inject contrast media into a catheter, inject medicine into a catheter, or to perform any other function that may be performed as part of a catheter based medical procedure, etc.). In some embodiments, one or more of the percutaneous intervention devices may be steerable, and controls 16 may be configured to allow a user to steer one or more steerable percutaneous device. In one such<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> embodiment, bedside system 12 may be equipped with a steerable guide catheter, and controls 16 may also be configured to allow the user located at remote workstation 14 to control the bending of the distal tip of a steerable guide catheter. Further embodiments of catheter system 10 including a steerable guide catheter are disclosed in P.C.T. International Application No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US201027666W" dnum-type="L"><text>PCT/US2010/27666, filed March 17, 2010</text></patcit>, published as <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2010107916A"><text>WO2010107916</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, controls 16 include a touch screen 18, a dedicated guide catheter control 29, a dedicated guide wire control 23, and a dedicated working catheter control 25. In this embodiment, guide wire control 23 is a joystick configured to advance, retract, or rotate a guide wire, working catheter control 25 is a joystick configured to advance, retract, or rotate a working catheter, and guide catheter control 29 is a joystick configured to advance, retract, or rotate a guide catheter. In addition, touch screen 18 may display one or more icons (such as icons 162, 164, and 166) that control movement of one or more percutaneous devices via bedside system 12 or to receive various inputs from the user as discussed below. Controls 16 may also include a balloon or stent control that is configured to inflate or deflate a balloon and/or a stent. Each of the controls may include one or more buttons, joysticks, touch screens, etc., that may be desirable to control the particular component to which the control is dedicated. As discussed in more detail below, catheter procedure system 10 includes a percutaneous device movement algorithm module or movement instruction module 114 that dictates how bedside system 12 responds to a user's manipulation of controls 16 to cause a percutaneous device to move in a particular way.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Controls 16 may include an emergency stop button 31 and a multiplier button 33. When emergency stop button 31 is pushed a relay is triggered to cut the power supply to bedside system 12. Multiplier button 33 acts to increase or decrease the speed at which the associated component is moved in response to a manipulation of guide catheter control 29, guide wire control 23, and working catheter control 25. For example, if operation of guide wire control 23 advances the guide wire at a rate of 1 mm/sec, pushing multiplier button 33 may cause operation of guide wire control 23 to advance the guide wire at a rate of 2 mm/sec. Multiplier button 33 may be a toggle allowing the multiplier effect to be toggled on and off. In another embodiment, multiplier button 33 must be held down by the user to increase the speed of a component during operation of controls 16.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">User interface 30 may include a first monitor 26 and a second monitor 28. First monitor 26 and second monitor 28 may be configured to display information or patient specific data to the user located at workstation 14. For example, first monitor 26 and second monitor 28 may be configured to display image data (e.g., x-ray images, MRI images, CT images, ultrasound images, etc.), hemodynamic data (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, etc.), patient record information (e.g., medical history, age, weight, etc.). In addition, first monitor 26 and second monitor 28 may be configured to display procedure specific information (e.g., duration of procedure, catheter or guide wire position, volume of medicine or contrast agent delivered, etc.). In one embodiment, the user may interact with or select various icons or information displayed on monitors 26 and 28 using a user input device or control (e.g., a mouse). Monitor 26 and monitor 28 may be configured to display information regarding the position and/or bend of the distal tip of a steerable guide catheter. Further, monitor 26 and monitor 28 may be configured to display information to provide the functionalities associated with the various modules of controller 40 discussed below. In another embodiment, user interface 30 includes a single screen of sufficient size to display one or more of the display components and/or touch screen components discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Catheter procedure system 10 also includes an imaging system 32 located within lab unit 11. Imaging system 32 may be any medical imaging system that may be used in conjunction with a catheter based medical procedure (e.g., non-digital x-ray, digital x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.). In an exemplary embodiment, imaging system 32 is a digital x-ray imaging device that is in communication with workstation 14. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, imaging system 32 may include a C-arm that allows imaging system 32 to partially or completely rotate around patient 21 in order to obtain images at different angular positions relative to patient 21 (e.g., sagittal views, caudal views, cranio-caudal views, etc.).</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Imaging system 32 is configured to take x-ray images of the appropriate area of patient 21 during a particular procedure. For example, imaging system 32 may be configured to take one or more x-ray images of the heart to diagnose a heart condition. Imaging system 32 may also be configured to take one or more x-ray images during a catheter based medical procedure (e.g., real-time images) to assist the user of workstation 14 to properly position a guide wire, guide catheter, working catheter, stent, etc. during the procedure. The image or images may be displayed on first monitor 26 and/or second monitor 28.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>

In various embodiments, procedure control module 98 is configured to generate one or more control signals 116 based upon the user's manipulation of controls 16 and based upon one or more active set of movement instructions provided by movement instruction module 114. Control signals generated by procedure control module 98 are communicated from controller 40 to the appropriate actuator or actuators of bedside system 12.

<p id="p0038" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, movement instruction module 114 is depicted according to an exemplary embodiment. In one embodiment, movement instruction module 114 is configured to allow the user to specifically control each movement of a percutaneous device via bedside system 12. In this embodiment, movement instruction module 114 includes a user control instruction set 180 that includes device movement instructions to cause bedside system 12 to move (e.g., advance, retract, rotate, etc.) the percutaneous device in a predefined, set manner (e.g., at a set rate, in a set direction, etc.) in response to a particular input received by controls 16.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">For example, user control instruction set 180 of movement instruction module 114 may be configured such that when guide wire control 23 is actuated, bedside system 12 causes the guide wire to advance, retract or rotate at a set rate. Thus, in this embodiment, movement instruction module 114 is configured to allow the user to control the rate and direction of movement of a percutaneous device based on the user's interaction with controls 16. Thus, for certain procedures, the user may select or activate user control instruction set 180 when the user desires to directly control every movement of the percutaneous device by manipulating controls 16.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In one specific embodiment, the movement rate of a percutaneous device caused by bedside system 12 is proportional to the amount of displacement of the control. For example, where controls 23, 25 and 29 are joystick controls, user control instruction set 180 may be configured such that the movement rate of a percutaneous device caused by bedside system 12 is proportional to the degree of displacement of the joystick from the resting position. Further, in this embodiment, the direction of movement (e.g., advancement or retraction) of the percutaneous device caused by bedside system 12 is based on the direction of displacement of the joystick from the resting position.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">As discussed above, controls 16 may include a multiplier button 33. Movement instruction module 114 may include a first set of instructions that is active or operative when multiplier button 33 is not activated and a second set of instructions that is operative when multiplier button 33 is activated. In this embodiment, the second set of instructions is configured to cause a percutaneous device to be moved faster by bedside system 12 than it would be moved under the control of the first set of instructions. Thus, when the user presses multiplier button 33, the second set of instructions of movement instruction module 114 is activated causing an increase in the rate of movement of a percutaneous device that results from a particular operation of controls 16. For example, if the first set of instructions of movement instruction module 114 dictates a 1 mm per second rate of advancement of the working catheter when control 16 is fully actuated (e.g., full displacement of a joystick control), then the second set of instructions of movement instruction module 114 may cause a 2 mm per second rate of advancement of the working catheter when control 16 is fully actuated.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In various embodiments, movement instruction module 114 may include various sets of instructions to facilitate the performance of certain movements of percutaneous devices via bedside system 12 without the user having to manually manipulate controls 16 in a series of complicated movements to generate a particular type of movement by the percutaneous device. In these embodiments, a user may select or activate a particular movement instruction set that defines a movement profile, and when controls 16 are manipulated by the user, the percutaneous device is moved in accordance with the movement profile. Thus, movement instruction module 114 may allow a particular movement of a percutaneous device associated with the activated instruction set to be performed consistently in each procedure. The movement profile needed to perform a particular procedure may depend on factors such as, the type of condition being treated<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> (e.g., a chronic total occlusion (CTO), partial occlusion, etc.), the location of the condition being treated (e.g., coronary arteries, peripheral arteries, etc.), the geometry of the area being treated, the particular type (e.g., make, model, size, etc.) of percutaneous device being used, etc.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In one embodiment, movement instruction module 114 may include an axial step movement profile instruction set 182 that is configured to cause bedside system 12 to move a percutaneous device in series of small axially steps or pulses when a user operates controls 16 to cause advancement of the percutaneous device. In such an embodiment, axial step movement profile instruction set 182 of movement instruction module 114 may specify a step distance (i.e., a. distance parameter of the step, e.g., .2 mm, .4 mm, .8 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, etc.), a step duration (i.e., the length of time it takes the device to move the step distance, e.g., .05 sec, .1 sec, .3 sec, .5, sec, 1 sec, etc.), and a rest duration (i.e., the length of time between steps, e.g., .05 sec, .1 sec, .3 sec, .5, sec, 1 sec, etc.). Such pulsed movement may be used to allow a percutaneous device to traverse a CTO. In this embodiment, advancement of the percutaneous device along its longitudinal axis occurs in a series of pulsed axial steps defined by the step distance, step duration, and rest duration.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In another embodiment, axial step movement profile instruction set 182 of movement instruction module 114 may include a movement profile that is configured to cause bedside system 12 to intersperse one or more retract pulses (i.e., pulses the move the device in a direction opposite of the direction of advancement) with the axial advance pulses when a user operates controls 16 to cause net advancement of a percutaneous device. In one embodiment, movement instruction module 114 may be configured to cause bedside system 12 to move a percutaneous device in a set of forward pulses that is followed by one or more retract pulses, which is then followed by a second set of forward pulses, and so on, while the user operates controls 16 to cause advancement of the percutaneous device. To ensure net forward progress utilizing such a movement profile, the instruction set ensures that the distance traveled during each set of forward pulses is greater than the distance traveled during the retract pulses. The retract pulse may allow the percutaneous device to disengage from a structure (e.g., lesion, vessel wall, etc.) prior to further advancement. In various embodiments, movement instruction module 114 may be configured to cause pulsed movement of any percutaneous device with which bedside system 12 is equipped, including the guide wire, working catheter, and guide catheter.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In another embodiment, movement instruction module 114 may include an automatic rotation movement profile instruction set 184 that is configured to cause bedside system 12 to rotate the percutaneous device at a set rate as the percutaneous device is advanced and/or retracted in response to the user's operation of controls 16 to cause advancement/retraction of a percutaneous device. In such an embodiment, automatic rotation movement profile instruction set 184 of movement instruction module 114 may specify an amount of rotation experienced by the percutaneous device as the percutaneous device is advanced or retracted (i.e., a rotation rate). The rotation rate may be specified in terms of degrees of rotation per unit of axial distance traveled (e.g., 360 degrees of rotation for each 2 mm traveled, etc.) or may be specified in terms of degrees of rotation per unit of time of axial travel (e.g., 360 degrees of rotation for each 5 seconds of axial travel). This embodiment allows the user to perform a drilling or corkscrew action with the percutaneous device without having to manually operate controls 16 to cause both axial movement and rotation. In various embodiments, movement instruction module 114 may include instructions to cause such movement of any device with which bedside system 12 is equipped, including the guide wire, working catheter, and guide catheter.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In various embodiments, controller 40 is configured to allow a user to set or select one more of the parameters associated with a particular movement profile.

In these embodiments, controls 16 may include at least one user input device or a control (e.g., touch screen icons 162, 164, 166, keyboard, etc.) that allows the user to input the parameters associated with a movement profile.</p>

In one embodiment, procedure control module 98 may be configured to display one or more icons (e.g., icons 162, 164, 166, etc.) on touch screen 18 that is associated with a set of movement instructions (e.g., profiles 182 and 184). When the user operates or touches one of the touch screen icons associated with a movement instruction set, bedside system 12 is controlled to move a percutaneous device in accordance with the instruction set associated with the touch screen icon. In one embodiment, certain user input<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> devices of controls 16 (e.g., one or more joysticks) may allow for total or specific control of movement of the percutaneous device by the user, and manipulation of the dedicated touch screen icon causes bedside system to advance the percutaneous device in accordance with an associated axial step movement profile or rotation movement profile.</p>

In this embodiment, controls 16 may include at least one user input device (e.g., touch screen icons 162, 164, 166) that allows the user to select whether catheter procedure system 10 is going to be used for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. In this embodiment, a user input device (e.g., touch screen icon 162, 164, 166) of controls 16 may be associated with a diagnostic procedure and another user input device may be associated with a therapeutic procedure, and selection or operation of the associated user input device by the user activates diagnostic procedure instruction set 186 or therapeutic procedure instruction set 188.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>

<p id="p0055" num="0055">Movement instruction module 114 has been described as including various instructions sets in various exemplary embodiments as discussed above. However, it should be understood that movement instruction module 114 may include any combination of one or more of the instruction sets discussed above. In any embodiment in which movement instruction module 114 includes more than one instruction set, controller 40 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> configured to select one or more proper instruction set to be activated for a particular procedure either automatically or based on a received user input.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">In various embodiments, controller 40 may be configured to allow the user of controls 16 to choose which instruction set or sets of movement instruction module 114 to activate for a particular procedure. In one such embodiment, one or more user input device (e.g., touch screen icon 162, 164, 166, a button, switch, etc.) of controls 16 may be associated with a particular movement instruction set, and selection or operation of the associated user input device activates the instruction set of movement instruction module 114 related to the desired movement parameter or movement profile. Then, with one of the instruction sets activated via operation of the associated user input device, the percutaneous device is moved in accordance with the activated movement instruction set as the user manipulates controls 16 (e.g., a joystick).</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">In one embodiment, procedure control module 98 may display information associated with one or more of the available instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 from which the user may chose. For example, a list of available instruction sets (e.g., instruction set for pulsed axial movement, instruction set for corkscrew motion, instruction sets for different percutaneous devices, etc.) may be displayed on a display device. In this embodiment, the user may then select the desired instruction set from the list to activate that instruction set using a device such as a mouse or touch screen. When an instruction set of movement instruction module 114 is activated, control signal 116 and the resulting movement of percutaneous device is based upon the user's manipulation of controls 16 and based upon the activated instruction set. In one embodiment, controller 40 is configured to display a separate touch screen icon associated with each movement instruction set of movement instruction module 114. In another embodiment, each available instruction set may be displayed as a list (e.g., a drop-down menu) allowing the user to select the desired instruction set via an input device such as a mouse.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">In other embodiments, controller 40 may be configured such that one or more movement instruction set of movement instruction module 114 may be active at one time. In this embodiment, the user may activate any combination of one or more instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 via the associated user input devices. In one embodiment, the user may select more than one instruction set from the list of available instruction sets. For example, the user may activate both the axial step movement profile and the rotational movement profile at the same time, such that operation of controls 16<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> causes bedside system 12 to move the percutaneous device both for rotation and pulsed axial advancement. As another example, the user may select one instruction set of the device specific instruction sets 190 for the device that the user is controlling via bedside system 12 and may select another instruction set for the type of movement (e.g., pulsed movement, corkscrew movement, etc.). In another embodiment, the user may also select an additional instruction set associated with the type of procedure being performed (e.g., diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). In other embodiments, a subset of the available movement instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 may be selectable by the user (e.g., profiles 182 and 184), and another subset of the available movement instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 may be automatically selected by controller 40, as described in more detail below. Once one or more instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 are activated, bedside system 12 will be operated based upon the user's manipulation of controls 16 and based upon the one or more activated instruction set.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">In some embodiments, procedure control module 98 may be configured to automatically select or activate one or more of the available instruction sets of movement instruction module 114 based upon data available to or received by controller 40. In one embodiment, the instruction set that is automatically activated is associated with a feature of the percutaneous device being controlled. In various embodiments, the feature of the percutaneous device may include the type, make, model and a physical property of the percutaneous device. In one such embodiment, the user may indicate the type of percutaneous device being used for a procedure, and procedure control module 98 may automatically activate the instruction set associated with that particular type of percutaneous device. The user may indicate the type of percutaneous device by any suitable means, for example, entry of the name, model number, or other identifying information of the percutaneous device via a keyboard, selection of the particular percutaneous device from a list, scanning of a barcode associated with the percutaneous device with a barcode reader in communication with controller 40, etc. In another embodiment, catheter procedure system 10 may include an RFID reader that reads an RFID tag containing identifying information associated with a percutaneous device that has been loaded into bedside system 12. The identifying information or data read by the RFID reader may then be communicated to procedure control module 98, and procedure control module 98 may select the appropriate instruction set from movement instruction module 114 based on the identifying information read by the RFID reader.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">In one embodiment, assist module 102 may be configured to provide information to the user (e.g., via display on monitor 26 and/or 28, etc.) to aid in the selection of the proper instruction set of movement instruction module 114 for a particular procedure. In one embodiment, assist module 102 may display a suggestion to the user regarding which instruction set should be activated for a particular procedure. In one embodiment, the suggestion generated by assist module 102 may be based on analysis of image data of a patient acquired during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. In one embodiment, assist module 102 may be configured to assess one or more property (e.g., density, degree of calcification, etc.) of a lesion (e.g., an atherosclerosis, etc.), and may suggest a movement instruction set suitable for traversing the lesion with the percutaneous device. For example, if a particular lesion is identified to have a high degree of calcification, assist module 102 may select a movement instruction set suitable to allow the percutaneous device to traverse the lesion, such as a pulsed movement instruction set with a relatively low pulse duration may.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">As mentioned, catheter procedure system 10 may be used to perform catheter based medical procedures. Typically, catheter based medical procedures involve the placement of a guide wire at a desired location in a patient's arterial system (e.g., the distal end of the guide wire positioned at or past a target lesion). Controller 40 may be used to operate bedside system 12 to advance a guide wire through a patient's arterial system until the distal end of the guide wire is positioned at the desired location. <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a method for navigating a guide wire in accordance with an embodiment. At block 302, the guide wire navigation process is begun. In an exemplary procedure, the guide wire may be inserted into an incision in the patient and, for example, into the femoral artery. At block 304, bedside system 12 is operated to advance the guide wire through the arterial system. In one embodiment, a user operates the bedside system 12 by manipulation of controls 16. For example, controller 40 generates control signals based upon the user input and controls the bedside system 12 (e.g., the guide wire advance/retract actuator 72) to advance the guide wire along a path through the coronary anatomy. The path may be traversed in discrete length steps based on the input provided by the user. In another embodiment, the user may provide a set of parameters that define a predetermined path to, for example, a target lesion. In this embodiment, controller 40 is configured to automatically advance the guide wire along the predetermined path. For example, the movement instruction module 114 of controller 40 may include a guide wire navigation module 192 (shown in <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) that is<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> configured to control the bedside system 12 to advance the guide wire along the predetermined path.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">At block 306, it is determined whether the guide wire is advancing through the proper path. <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates an exemplary path to a lesion in the heart. In <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref>, a guide wire 402 is passed through a guide catheter 404 into an artery 412 of the heart 406. A path to a target lesion 408 may, for example, pass though one or more junction points 414 in the coronary anatomy. The guide wire 402, in particular a distal end 410 of the guide wire 402, needs to be advanced through the proper vessels to reach the desired location, for example, the target lesion 408. In one embodiment, an imaging system 32 may be used to provide fluoroscopic images of a region of interest showing the path to the target lesion. The images may be displayed (for example, on a monitor 26, 28) and used to determine if the guide wire is passing through the correct passageway (or vessel) to reach the desired location. In one embodiment, a user may view the images on a display to determine the location of the guide wire. In another embodiment, controller 40 may be configured to process the images to determine the location of the guide wire.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">Returning to <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, if the guide wire is not advancing along the correct path (e.g., the guide wire does not track into the correct vessel or branch at a junction point), the user may, not according to the invention, provide an input to operate the bedside system 12 to retract the guide wire. According to the invention, the controller 40 is configured to automatically retract the guide wire when it is determined that the guide wire is not advancing along the correct path. In this embodiment, the guide wire navigation module 192 is configured to automatically retract the guide wire. At block 308, the controller 40 (for example, the guide wire navigation module 192) is configured to control the bedside system 12 to rotate and retract the guide wire in response to a control signal to retract the guide wire. Not according to the invention, the guide wire is rotated and then retracted. Also not according to the invention, the guide wire may be retracted and then rotated. According to the invention, the guide wire is rotated and retracted simultaneously. Accordingly, the guide wire rotates while being retracted. In one embodiment, the proximal end of the guide wire is rotated (e.g., using a guide wire rotate actuator) a predetermined amount (e.g., 180 degrees). In another embodiment, the guide wire may first be rotated a first amount in a first direction and then rotated a second amount in the opposite direction. <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a guide wire 402 retracted to a point before the junction 414. In one embodiment, the guide wire 402 is retraced a distance that positions the distal end 410 of the guide wire before the junction point 414. As mentioned, the guide<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> wire is rotated while being retracted. In another embodiment, if it is required to retract the guide wire multiple times to position the distal end 410 prior to the junction 414, the guide wire may only be rotated with the first retraction of the guide wire.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">At block 310 of <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, bedside system 12 is operated to advance the guide wire. <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7C</figref> shows the guide wire 402 advanced past the junction point 414 and into the desired path to the target lesion 408. In one example not according to the invention, a user operates the bedside system 12 by manipulation of controls 16. According to the invention, controller 40 (for example, guide wire navigation module 192) is configured to automatically advance the guide wire along a predetermined path. At block 306 of <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, if the guide wire is still not advancing along the correct path, steps 306 to 310 are repeated until the guide wire is located in the correct passageway. In one embodiment, the controller 40 (for example, guide wire navigation module 193) is configured to automatically repeat the iterations of steps 306 to 310 until a user provides an input indicating the guide wire is in the correct passageway. In one embodiment, the amount of rotation of the guide wire is changed for each retraction of the guide wire (i.e. with each iteration). At block 312, it is determined whether the guide wire is positioned at the desired location (e.g., at a target lesion). If the guide wire is not at the proper location, the process returns to block 304 and the guide wire is advanced. If the guide wire is at the desired location, the next steps in the catheter procedure may begin at block 314. For example, a working catheter may be positioned and a therapeutic procedure performed.</p>
