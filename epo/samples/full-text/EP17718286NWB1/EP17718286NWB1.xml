<heading id="h0003"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Animals such as mammals and birds are often susceptible to parasite infestations/infections. These parasites may be ectoparasites, such as insects, and endoparasites such as filariae and other worms. Domesticated animals, such as cats and dogs, are often infested with one or more of the following ectoparasites:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>fleas (e.g. <i>Ctenocephalides</i> spp., such as <i>Ctenocephalides felis</i> and the like);</li>
<li>ticks (e.g. <i>Rhipicephalus</i> spp., <i>Ixodes</i> spp., <i>Dermacentor</i> spp., <i>Amblyomma</i> spp., and the like);</li>
<li>mites (e.g. <i>Demodex</i> spp., <i>Sarcoptes</i> spp., <i>Otodectes</i> spp., and the like);</li>
<li>lice (e.g. <i>Trichodectes</i> spp., <i>Cheyletiella</i> spp., <i>Linognathus</i> spp. and the like);</li>
<li>mosquitoes (<i>Aedes</i> spp., <i>Culex</i> spp., <i>Anopheles</i> spp. and the like); and</li>
<li>flies (<i>Haematobia</i> spp., <i>Musca</i> spp., <i>Stomoxys</i> spp., <i>Dermatobia</i> spp., <i>Cochliomyia</i> spp. and the like).</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Fleas are a particular problem because not only do they adversely affect the health of the animal or human, but they also cause a great deal of psychological stress. Moreover, fleas are also vectors of pathogenic agents in animals and humans, such as dog tapeworm (<i>Dipylidium caninum</i>).</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Similarly, ticks are also harmful to the physical and psychological health of the animal or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> human. However, the most serious problem associated with ticks is that they are the vector of pathogenic agents in both humans and animals. Major diseases which are caused by ticks include borreliosis (Lyme disease caused by <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>), babesiosis (or piroplasmosis caused by <i>Babesia</i> spp.) and rickettsioses (also known as Rocky Mountain spotted fever). Ticks also release toxins which cause inflammation or paralysis in the host. Occasionally, these toxins are fatal to the host.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Likewise, farm animals are also susceptible to parasite infestations. For example, cattle are affected by a large number of parasites. A parasite which is very prevalent among farm animals is the tick genus <i>Rhipicephalus</i> (<i>Boophilus</i>)<i>,</i> especially those of the species <i>microplus</i> (cattle tick), <i>decoloratus</i> and <i>annulatus.</i> Ticks, such as <i>Rhipicephalus</i> (<i>Boophilus</i>) <i>microplus,</i> are particularly difficult to control because they live in the pasture where farm animals graze.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Animals and humans also suffer from endoparasitic infections including, for example, helminthiasis which is most frequently caused by a group of parasitic worms categorized as cestodes (tapeworm), nematodes (roundworm) and trematodes (flatworm or flukes). These parasites adversely affect the nutrition of the animal and cause severe economic losses in pigs, sheep, horses, and cattle as well as affecting domestic animals and poultry. Other parasites which occur in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans include Ancylostoma, Necator, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Capillaria, Toxocara, Toxascaris, Trichuris, Enterobius and parasites which are found in the blood or other tissues and organs such as filarial worms and the extra intestinal stages of Strongyloides, Toxocara and Trichinella.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Recently, isoxazole and isoxazoline-containing compounds have been demonstrated to be effective against parasites that harm animals. For example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US7964204B"><text>US 7,964,204</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US8410153B"><text>US 8,410,153</text></patcit> (to DuPont) disclose isoxazoline compounds according to Formula (I) below, which are active against ectoparasites and.

<p id="p0012" num="0012">It is known in the field that isoxazoline compounds having a chiral quaternary carbon atom such as the carbon atom adjacent to the oxygen on the isoxazoline ring of the compounds described above have at least two optical isomer (enantiomers) that are mirror images of each other. Furthermore, it is sometimes the case with biologically active compounds that one of the enantiomers is more active than the other enantiomer. In addition, it is sometimes the case that one enantiomer of a biologically active compound is less toxic than the other enantiomer. Therefore, with optically active compounds it is desirable to utilize the enantiomer that is most active and less toxic (eutomer). However, isolating the most active enantiomer from a mixture can be costly and result in waste of up to half of the racemic mixture prepared.</p>

<p id="p0029" num="0029">The chiral phase transfer of formula (IIIa) or (IIIb) used in the process is a very important factor for achieving the best possible enrichment of the desired enantiomer. It has been surprisingly found that when R in formula (IIIa) or (IIIb) is a substituted aryl group, including a phenyl group, the type of substituent and the extent of substitution has a pronounced effect on the stereoselectivity of the reaction. Although quinine phase transfer catalysts are known and have been used for the preparation of chiral isoxazoline compounds (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="WO2011104089A1"><text>WO 2011/104089 A1</text></patcit>), it has surprisingly been discovered that certain substituents unexpectedly improve the selectivity of the reaction. It has been found that electron-donating substituents, such as alkoxy groups, on the aryl or heteroaryl group R improve the selectivity for the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer if (IIIa) is used. In addition, multiple substitution of the aryl or heteroaryl group R with electron donating groups further improves the selectivity of the reaction for the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer. Of course, if the stereochemistry of the chiral catalyst is reversed and (IIIb) is used, the selectivity is for the (<i>R</i>)-enantiomer.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Skilled persons in the art will understand that in some circumstances mixtures of the phase transfer catalysts described herein may be used to achieve the enantiomerically enriched isoxazoline compounds. Further, it will be understood that a given catalyst (for example, Formula (IIIa-13-1) may contain small amounts of other catalyst having a different group W (ethyl or vinyl) or R' (e.g. methoxy or hydrogen). Nevertheless, the presence of small amounts of catalysts substituted with other groups W and R' will still be useful for preparing the enantiomerically enriched isoxazoline compounds describe herein.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">It has been found that using a quinine phase transfer catalyst of formula (IIIa) or (IIIb), wherein R is a phenyl group tri-substituted with aralkoxy groups, a surprisingly high selectivity for the formation of chiral isoxazoline compounds compared with known quinine phase transfer catalysts is achieved, even superior to quinine catalysts where the group corresponding to R is an aryl group substituted with one or more alkoxy groups. Thus, phase transfer catalysts of formula (IIIa) or (IIIb) wherein R is a phenyl group substituted by 3 aralkoxy groups have been found to provide surprising selectivity in the formation of chiral isoxazoline compounds of formula (I) compared with known quinine phase transfer catalysts. In one preferred embodiment, the chiral quinine phase transfer catalysts are substituted with 3 benzyloxy groups (-OCH<sub>2</sub>Ph).<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention provides chiral quinine phase transfer catalysts of formula (IIIa) wherein W is ethyl or vinyl, R' is methoxy or hydrogen and R is 3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)phenyl.

<p id="p0105" num="0105">Once the reaction has progressed to a suitable extent, the reaction may be worked up by procedures known by persons skilled in the art. For example, water and an aqueous acid solution may be added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mixture may be warmed slightly with stirring. The addition of a dilute acid solution neutralizes the base to achieve a somewhat neutral mixture (target pH 7-8). Any suitable acid may be used to neutralize the basic reaction mixture including dilute hydrohalides (e.g. HCl), carboxylic acids/carboxylates (e.g. acetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, etc.), ammonium salts (e.g. ammonium chloride), monobasic phosphates (e.g. KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), hydrogen bisulfate salts (e.g. KHSO<sub>4</sub>), and the like. The biphasic mixture may be settled and the organic phase separated and washed with a dilute acid solution (e.g. KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> or similar) to further neutralize the mixture.

In one embodiment, the product may be crystallized by adding the desired crystallization solvent to the crude product mixture while distilling the mixture, optionally under vacuum, to exchange the reaction solvent for the crystallization solvent until a sufficient amount of the reaction solvent/solvent mixture has been removed and replaced with the desired crystallization solvent (or mixture of solvents). The mixture may then be concentrated further until a suitable concentration is achieved. As known in the art, it is desirable to adjust the concentration of the product in the crystallization solvent/mixture of solvents so that the concentration is above the<!-- EPO <DP n="81"> --> saturation concentration at the temperature at which the product will be crystallized (e.g. after cooling) but below the saturation concentration at elevated temperature (e.g. in solution).

<p id="p0110" num="0110">In one embodiment of the invention, the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer of afoxolaner prepared by the process of the invention is crystallized from toluene to produce crystals of very high purity. It was surprisingly found that the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer of afoxolaner forms a crystalline solvate with toluene (see example 12) while racemic afoxolaner does not. Because of this characteristic, the crystallization of the desired (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer from toluene resulted in a significant improvement of the enantiomeric purity of the product compared with the ratio of enantiomers in the completed reaction mixture. The selective crystallization of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner with other aromatic solvents has also been achieved (e.g. anisole, chlorobenzene, etc). This is surprising because typically one enantiomer will not be enriched over the other enantiomer unless the crystallization is conducted using a chiral system in which there is a preference for one enantiomer over the other. Crystallizations of this type are known using, for example, chiral bases when the chiral product is an acid. However, it is very surprising that the crystallization of one enantiomer from a non-chiral solvent such as toluene results in not only the purification of the product (e.g.<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> removal of non-chiral reaction impurities and starting material) but also results in the enrichment of the desired enantiomer.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">The crystallization of the desired enantiomerically pure isoxazoline compounds of the invention from a suitable solvent including, but not limited to, those described above may be achieved by a solvent switch from the reaction solvent to the solvent used for crystallization at a suitable volume by distillation, optionally under vacuum, as known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the worked-up reaction mixture may be concentrated to a volume such as between about 0.5 to 30 volumes based on the compound of formula (II). More typically, the worked-up reaction mixture may be concentrated to a volume of between about 1 to about 20 or between about 2 and 10 volumes. In other embodiments, the reaction mixture is concentrated to between about 1 to about 5 volumes, about 1 to about 3 volumes or between about 1 to about 2 volumes.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">Once a suitable amount of the reaction solvent has been removed, a suitable amount of the crystallization solvent is added and the volume of the mixture is adjusted by distillation (optionally under vacuum) to an appropriate volume (optionally with further addition of crystallization solvent) so that the product will crystallize out of solution upon cooling. In principle, the volume from which the product is not critical; however, having too much solvent in the crystallization may result in higher losses of product in the mother liquors. On the other hand, crystallizing the product from a mixture that is too concentrated may result in poorer quality product. The volume of the pre-crystallization mixture depends on the solubility of the product in the crystallization solvent. In one embodiment, the pre-crystallization volume may be between about 1 volume to about 30 volumes. In some embodiments, the volume of the pre-crystallization mixture may be between about 1 volume and about 20 volumes or between about 1 volume to about 10 volumes. More typically, the volume of the pre-crystallization mixture may be from about 2 volumes to about 10 volumes, about 3 volumes to about 8 volumes or about 4 volumes to about 7 volumes. In one embodiment, the pre-crystallization volume may be about 5-6 volumes before cooling the mixture.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">When the pre-crystallization mixture is cooled slowly the desired product will crystallize out of solution and may be isolated by filtration. Since there is always some amount of the undesired enantiomer, it is possible with certain isoxazoline compounds that the undesired enantiomer or the racemic compound may crystallize out of solution faster than the desired<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --> enantiomer. For example, it was found that in one embodiment of the invention for the synthesis of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner that racemic afoxolaner crystallized out (unsolvated) of solution from toluene faster than the pure (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer. The crystals of the racemic afoxolaner have a higher melting point than the crystals of the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer solvate. Thus, the crystals of the racemic compound may be removed by adjusting the temperature of the mixture to a temperature where the racemic compound crystallizes out of solution and then filtering off the solid to afford the desired enantiomer in solution. Seed of the undesired enantiomer or racemic compound to induce crystallization of these compounds may be added. Once most of the racemic compound is removed, the volume of the filtrate may be adjusted further (e.g. by distillation or addition of more crystallization solvent) and the solution cooled to induce crystallization of the desired compound.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In one embodiment, the crystallization of the racemic compound may be conducted by seeding with crystals of the racemic compound at a low temperature to induce crystallization of the compound, aging the mixture for a suitable time, heating to dissolve most of the desired enantiomer, aging at the higher temperature and filtering the mixture to remove the solid. In one embodiment, the seeding and crystallization of the racemic compound is conducted at a temperature of between about -10° C to about 30° C. In other embodiments, the seeding step is conducted between about 0° C to about 20° C, about 0° C to about 15° C or about 5° C to about 15° C. In another embodiment, the seeding and crystallization is conducted by seeding with the racemic compound at a temperature of about 7° C to about 13° C and aging for a suitable time to ensure that most of the racemic compound has crystallized.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">The mixture is then heated to a higher temperature to dissolve the desired enantiomer while maintaining the crystals of the racemic compound. In one embodiment, the mixture is heated to a temperature of about 30° C to about 100° C. More typically, the mixture is heated to about 30° C to about 80° C and aged for a suitable time to dissolve the desired enantiomer while keeping the racemic compound in solid form. Even more typically, the mixture is heated to a temperature of between about 40° C to about 70° C, about 50° C to about 70° C or about 55° C to about 65° C. In yet another embodiment, the mixture is heated to about 57° C to about 63° C and aged for a suitable amount of time. The mixture is then filtered to remove the solid comprising the undesired racemic compound.<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --></p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">The resulting filtrate is crystallized by again adjusting the volume to the desired volume using distillation and/or addition of more crystallization solvent and then cooling slowly to a suitable temperature to induce crystallization of the desired enantiomer. In one embodiment, the mixture is cooled to a temperature of about -10° C to about 30° C. In other embodiments, the seeding step is conducted between about 0° C to about 20° C, about 0° C to about 15° C or about 5° C to about 15° C. In another embodiment, the mixture is cooled to a temperature of about 7° C to about 13° C.

A similar process as described above may be used with the exception that the pre-crystallization of the undesired enantiomer or racemic compound will not likely be necessary. In one embodiment, the desired enantiomer of the isoxazoline compound may be re-crystallized from a mixture of an aliphatic solvent and an alcohol solvent. In another embodiment, the isoxazoline compound may be re-crystallized from a mixture of an aliphatic solvent and a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alcohol solvent. In another embodiment, the isoxazoline compound may be re-crystallized from a mixture of a cycloalkyl solvent and a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alcohol solvent.

<p id="p0118" num="0118">In one embodiment using a solvent combination of an aliphatic and an alcohol solvent, the mixture containing the solid product and the crystallization solvent is heated to dissolve the solid and then cooled to a suitable temperature to seed the solution with seed crystals of the product, if desired. Seeding the crystallization mixture is optional but may be desired to form larger crystal of the desired form. In another embodiment, the product is first dissolved in the solvent in which the compound is more soluble (e.g. alcohol solvent) and the other solvent is added at elevated temperature.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">In one embodiment, in which a solvent mixture of an alcohol solvent and an aliphatic solvent is used for crystallization of the product, a volume ratio of about 1:10 to 1:99, volume of alcohol to volume of aliphatic solvent may be used.

In another embodiment, the volume ratio of an alcohol solvent and aliphatic solvent in a mixture may be from about 1:5 to about 1:15, from about 1:8 to about 1:13 or from about 1:10 to about 1:13, volume of alcohol to volume of aliphatic solvent. In another embodiment, the volume ratio of an alcohol solvent to aliphatic solvent in a solvent mixture may be from about 1:10 to about 1:30 or about 1:15 to about 1:25.

<p id="p0120" num="0120">The amount of aliphatic solvent used in the crystallization of the isoxazoline compounds of the invention when part of a solvent system with an alcohol solvent will also depend on the specific aliphatic solvent used and the specific isoxazoline compound. In one embodiment, the amount of aliphatic solvent used may be from about 5 to about 30 volumes based on the volume of the product re-crystallized or on the volume of the starting material if crystallized from the synthesis sequence. In other embodiments, from about 5 to about 20 volumes of an aliphatic solvent may be used. More typically, from about 10 to about 20 volumes of an aliphatic solvent may be suitable.

In one embodiment, the mixture is heated to temperature of between about 57° C to about 63° C to dissolve the solid.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">Once the solid is dissolved, additional solvent may be added to bring the mixture to a point at or just above saturation. Typically, the solvent which is added is one in which the product is less soluble. The resulting mixture may be cooled slightly to bring the mixture to the saturation point and then optionally seeded with crystals of the desired enantiomer. The mixture is then slowly cooled further to a suitable temperature and then aged. The product is isolated by filtration or centrifugation and the product is dried optionally under vacuum.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">The temperature at which the crystallization mixture is seeded (if done) depends on the isoxazoline compound and the solvents used for the crystallization.

<p id="p0124" num="0124">After seeding with seed crystals of the desired product, in some embodiments the mixture may be cooled to an intermediate temperature (e.g. between the final crystallization temperature and the seeding temperature) and aged. The mixture may also be re-heated to a temperature close to or slightly above the temperature at which the mixture was seeded and then re-cooled slowly.

<p id="p0126" num="0126">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the rate of cooling is very important in the crystallization process.

<p id="p0251" num="0251">As shown in the table, the catalyst in which the group R in the structure of formula (IIIa) is 3,4,5-tribenzyloxyphenyl results in a surprising improved selectivity for the (S)-enantiomer compared with other quinine-based phase transfer catalysts in which the group corresponding to R in formula (IIIa) is another group.</p>
<heading id="h0036">Example 10*: Improvement of Chiral Purity of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner by Crystallization from Toluene</heading>
<p id="p0252" num="0252">A sample of reaction mixture containing a ratio (HPLC area) of 92.1:7.9, (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner to (<i>R</i>)-afoxolaner, was concentrated to dryness and the residue was crystallized from toluene and from ethanol/cyclohexane using a process similar to that described in Example 8. The isolated crystalline solid was analyzed by chiral HPLC to determine the relative amounts of (S)-afoxolaner and (R)-afoxolaner (HPLC method: column - Chiralpak AD-3 150 mm x 4.6 mm x 3.0 µm, injection volume - 10 µL, temperature - 35° C, flow - 0.8 mL/minute, mobile phase - 89% hexane/10% isopropanol/1% methanol, detection - 312 nm). The ratio of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner to (<i>R</i>)-afoxolaner in the solid isolated from the toluene crystallization was found to be 99.0 : 1.0 while the ratio of (S)-afoxolaner to (R)-afoxolaner in the solid crystallized from ethanol/cyclohexane was found to be 95.0 : 5.0.</p>
<p id="p0253" num="0253">The example shows that the crystallization (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner from an aromatic solvent such as toluene results in a significant improvement of chiral purity of the product. This is very unexpected and surprising.</p>

<p id="p0255" num="0255">The amount of solvents and reagents and the reaction and isolation conditions were as described in Example 7 above. The same procedure was used for each catalyst tested. It was found that the selectivity of the tri-benzyloxy catalyst was surprisingly significantly better than the two alkoxy-substituted catalysts, as shown by the chiral purity of the product. Furthermore, it was found that using the tri-benzyloxy substituted phase transfer catalyst the resulting chemical purity was also much better. The superior selectivity of the benzyloxy-substituted catalyst is significant and surprising and cannot be predicted. Chiral phase transfer catalysts containing a phenyl substituted with benzyloxy and alkoxy groups were found to be superior to catalysts substituted with other groups such as electron-withdrawing groups and alkyl groups. The chiral purity and chemical purity of the product produced from the respective phase-transfer catalysts is shown in the Table 3 below:

<p id="p0256" num="0256">The amount of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner shown in Table 4 in powder form was placed in a glass tube and numbered accordingly. The crystallization solvent (Table 4) was then added into the tube. The volume of crystallization solvent (see Table 4) was adjusted to obtain preferentially a suspension at room temperature and a clear solution at high temperature. The tube was then hermetically closed to prevent evaporation of the crystallization solvent and heated 1h at high temperature (see Table 4) while the solution was vortexed at 400 rpm or stirred by a magnetic bar to dissolve the (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner. To induce the crystallization of the product, the tube was then cooled at a rate and to a temperature given in Table 4. When crystals were suspected in the tube, the solution was then filtered under vacuum and the obtained solid was analyzed by X-Ray Powder Diffraction. When any crystals weren't suspected in the tube, further treatment mentioned on the Table 4 was applied on the solution before X-Ray Powder Diffraction. All Samples 1-5 were confirmed to be a crystalline toluene solvate of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner.

<heading id="h0039">Example 13*: Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction</heading>
<p id="p0260" num="0260">A single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted on a crystal of toluene solvate produced by crystallization of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner made by the process of the invention according to Examples 7 and 8. The crystal structure of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner was solved and refined to a final R factor of 5.5%. The structure was found to be a triclinic which contains two independent molecules of (<i>S</i>)-afoxolaner and two toluene molecules. The crystal structure was found to be strongly disordered as shown in <figref idref="f0009">Figure 9</figref>. Table 7 below describes some information describing the crystal and molecular structure.
