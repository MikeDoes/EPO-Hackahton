<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present application claims priority to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR1020190110757"><text>Korean Patent Application No. 10-2019-0110757 filed on September 6, 2019</text></patcit> in the Republic of Korea, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND ART</u></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In the field of lithium secondary batteries, a pre-lithiation process refers to a process for preliminary lithiation of an electrode, particularly a negative electrode, to a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, such a pre-lithiation process is carried out in a reaction vessel 200, such as a container 210, in which an electrolyte 220 containing a lithium source is received and a negative electrode 230 and lithium metal 240 are in contact with each other. The pre-lithiation reaction vessel 200 is disposed in a kind of a reaction chamber apparatus 100, such as a dry room.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In general, pre-lithiation is carried out after a reaction vessel configured to carry out pre-lithiation is introduced to a dry room. However, it is very difficult to control the water content in the dry room to a level of less than 10 ppm due to a process of introducing the pre-lithiation reaction vessel to the dry room, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, the dry room includes water, most of which has a dew point of -50 to -60°C, at approximately 15-50 ppm. When the water content present in the dry room is dissolved in the electrolyte at a level of 10 ppm, it reacts with a lithium salt, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> LiPF<sub>6</sub>, to form a byproduct, such as PF<sub>5</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The byproduct, such as PF<sub>5</sub>, may break the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film formed on a negative electrode. In this case, surplus lithium ions introduced to the negative electrode are oxidized due to high reactivity, and thus the negative electrode is easily returned to its original discharged state, i.e. non-lithiated state.</p>

<heading id="h0008"><u>BEST MODE</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus including a pre-lithiation reaction vessel, wherein the pre-lithiation reaction vessel includes an electrolyte, a negative electrode for a lithium secondary battery and a lithium ion-supplying member, each of the negative electrode for a lithium secondary battery and the lithium ion-supplying member is at least partially in contact with the electrolyte, the electrolyte includes a lithium salt, the pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus further includes a water-capturing member, and the water-capturing member includes: water-capturing powder; a container configured to receive the water-capturing powder; and a position-changing member configured to change the position of the water-capturing powder in the container.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The water-capturing powder used for the water-capturing member is provided in the form of powder and is not particularly limited, as long as it can be used conventionally in the art. Non-limiting examples of the water-capturing powder include CaO, MgO, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, CaZrO<sub>3</sub>, CaTiO<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, BaO, Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, CoSO<sub>4</sub>, Ga<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, Ti(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NiSO<sub>4</sub>, SrCl<sub>2</sub>, YCl<sub>3</sub>, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, CsF, TaF<sub>5</sub>, NbF<sub>5</sub>, LiBr, CaBr<sub>2</sub>, CeBr<sub>3</sub>, SeBr<sub>4</sub>, VBr<sub>3</sub>, MgBr<sub>2</sub>, BaI<sub>2</sub>, MgI<sub>2</sub>, Ba(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Mg(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or a mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The container configured to receive the water-capturing powder is not particularly limited in its material, as long as the material does not react with the water-capturing powder or water. Particular examples of the material include SUS, plastic, a material attached to a magnetic body, stainless steel, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition, the container configured to receive the water-capturing powder is not<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> particularly limited in terms of structure, as long as it is fabricated to have such a structure that water present in the pre-lithiation reaction chamber may be in contact with the water-capturing powder received in the container. For example, the container may have a cubic or cuboid shape, a shape five sides of which are closed and one side (top) of which is opened, a shape five sides of which are closed and one side of which has one or a plurality of holes, or a shape one or more sides of which are closed and the remaining sides of which has one or a plurality of holes. The container is fabricated in such a manner that the powder may be received inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The container configured to receive the water-capturing powder may include a position-changing member, which can change the position of the water-capturing powder, inside thereof or at the bottom thereof.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In general, a viscous material is formed in the water-capturing powder used for capturing water, particularly on the surface layer of the water-capturing powder that is in contact with air, after the water-capturing powder captures water, i.e. reacts with water. Therefore, the water-capturing powder is not in contact with air any longer and it may be inhibited or prohibited from being in contact with water in the air. Therefore, the water-capturing powder dose not capture water in the air any longer. As a result, once the water-capturing member is disposed at a predetermined site for the purpose of capturing water, it undergoes degradation of its water-capturing function, after the lapse of a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">According to the present disclosure, in order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the water-capturing powder is introduced to the pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus, while a position-changing member capable of changing the position of the water-capturing powder is disposed in the container, so that the water-capturing powder<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> may realize its function for a long time. The position-changing member prevents formation of a viscous material on the surface layer of the water-capturing powder and interruption of contact between the powder and air. In this manner, the position-changing member allows the water-capturing powder to realize its water-capturing function continuously for a long time. As a result, the water content in the pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus is controlled extremely, and the negative electrode is pre-lithiated homogeneously and efficiently.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">When the position-changing member is disposed in the container, it may be a rotating member. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the rotating member may be a rotating shaft mounted to the inner wall of the container.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the rotating member may include a rotating shaft 330 disposed from one sidewall to the other sidewall inside of the container 310, and a thread 331 formed spirally on the rotating shaft 330, as shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. In the case of such a rotating member, while pre-lithiation is carried out in the pre-lithiation reaction vessel 200, the rotating shaft 330 is rotated and the thread 331 changes the position of the water-capturing powder 320.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the rotating member may include a rotating shaft 330 disposed from one sidewall to the other sidewall inside of the container 310, and two or more agitation fans 332 mounted linearly to the rotating shaft 330, as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. In the case of such a rotating member, while pre-lithiation is carried out in the pre-lithiation reaction vessel 200, the rotating shaft 330 is rotated and the agitation fan 332 changes the position of the water-capturing powder 320.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">According to still another embodiment of the present disclosure, the rotating member may include a rotating shaft 330 disposed from one sidewall to the other<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> sidewall inside of the container 310, and two or more modified agitation fans 333 formed with a streamlined shape, while forming an angle of less than 90° to the rotating shaft 330, as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>. In the case of such a rotating member, while pre-lithiation is carried out in the pre-lithiation reaction vessel 200, the rotating shaft 330 is rotated and the modified agitation fan 333 changes the position of the water-capturing powder 320.

<p id="p0082" num="0082">It can be seen from the above results that Examples 1 and 2 show a lower electrode OCV after pre-lithiation, as compared to Comparative Examples 1 and 2. This suggests that the water content in the pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus is controlled sufficiently so that the charged negative electrode may be protected well by a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. On the contrary, the lithium secondary batteries using the pre-lithiated negative electrodes according to Comparative Examples 1-4 show a high OCV and low discharge capacity, despite pre-lithiation, since the SEI layer of each negative electrode is broken due to the water content present in the pre-lithiation reaction chamber apparatus, and thus pre-lithiation cannot be performed to a desired level.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">In addition, referring to cycle characteristics and initial efficiency, it can be seen that each of the lithium secondary batteries according to Examples 1 and 2 shows a high initial efficiency and high capacity retention at the 100<sup>th</sup> cycle. It is thought that this is because the lithium secondary batteries according to Examples 1 and 2 use a negative electrode pre-lithiated under a condition with an effectively controlled water content, unlike Comparative Examples 1-4. In the case of Comparative Examples 1-4, it is thought that the SEI layer on each negative electrode surface is not homogeneous to cause a partial side reaction of the electrolyte, resulting in a loss of capacity. In addition, it is thought that resistance is increased due to the electrolyte decomposition products to provide a low initial efficiency and low capacity retention at the 100<sup>th</sup> cycle.</p>
