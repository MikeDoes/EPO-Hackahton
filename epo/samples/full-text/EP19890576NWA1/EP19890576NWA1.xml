<heading id="h0002"><b>[Background Art]</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The importance of display devices is increasing along with the development of multimedia. Accordingly, various types of display devices, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), are being used.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Display devices are devices that display an image and include a display panel such as an organic light-emitting display panel or a liquid crystal display panel. Among these, the display device may include light-emitting elements as a light-emitting display panel. For example, a light-emitting diode (LED) may include an OLED that uses an organic material as a fluorescent material, an inorganic light-emitting diode that uses an inorganic material as a fluorescent material, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The inorganic light-emitting diode using an inorganic semiconductor as a fluorescent material has durability even in a high temperature environment and has high blue light efficiency as compared with the OLED. In addition, even in a manufacturing process pointed out as a limitation of the conventional inorganic light-emitting diode element, a transfer method using a dielectrophoresis (DEP) method has<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> been developed. Accordingly, research is continuously conducted on an inorganic light-emitting diode having excellent durability and efficiency as compared with an OLED.</p>

<heading id="h0006">[Advantageous Effects]</heading>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">A display device according to one embodiment may include a shielding electrode disposed adjacent to an alignment area for inorganic light-emitting diodes or disposed to form a pattern in a non-alignment area. Since the shielding electrode forms an area in which an electric field is not formed when the inorganic light-emitting<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> diodes are aligned, the inorganic light-emitting diodes can be selectively aligned only in an area in which the shielding electrode is not disposed.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Accordingly, in the display device, the inorganic light-emitting diodes can be aligned to have high alignment in the area in which the shielding electrode is not disposed. In the display device in which the inorganic light-emitting diodes are aligned to have high alignment, emission uniformity for each pixel can be improved, and a loss rate of the inorganic light-emitting diodes can be reduced.</p>

<heading id="h0008">[Modes of the Invention]</heading>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">It will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being "on" another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate, or intervening layers may also be present. The same reference numbers indicate the same components throughout the specification.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">It will be understood that, although the terms "first," "second," etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. For instance, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the present invention. Similarly, the second element could also be termed the first element.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of a display device according to one embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a display device 10 may include a plurality of pixels PX. Each of the pixels PX may include one or more light-emitting elements 300 configured to emit light having a specific wavelength, thereby displaying a specific color.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Each of the plurality of pixels PX may include a first subpixel PX1, a second subpixel PX2, and a third subpixel PX3. The first subpixel PX1 may emit light having a first color, the second subpixel PX2 may emit light having a second color, and the third subpixel PX3 may emit light having a third color. The first color may be a red color, the second color may be a green color, and the third color may be a blue color, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In some cases, subpixels PXn may emit light having the same color. In addition, although <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that each of the pixels PX includes three subpixels, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and each of the pixels PX may include four or more subpixels.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">Each of the subpixels PXn of the display device 10 may include an alignment area AA in which the light-emitting element 300 is disposed and a non-alignment area NAA. The alignment area AA may be defined as an area in which a shielding electrode layer 800 to be described below is not disposed and the light-emitting elements 300 are aligned on exposed electrodes 210 and 220. The non-alignment area NAA may be defined as an area, in which the light-emitting elements 300 are not aligned, other than the alignment area AA.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Meanwhile, in the present specification, the terms such as "exposed" or "exposing" mean that a first member and a second member include an area in which the first member and the second member do not partially overlap each other in a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> thickness direction thereof. Even when any one member is not exposed to the outside, it can be interpreted by the terms. That is, even when at least one member is disposed between the first member and the second member, an area, in which the first member and the second member do not overlap each other in the thickness direction, is disposed, it may be interpreted that any one member exposes another member or is exposed by another member.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">The display device 10 according to one embodiment may include the shielding electrode layer 800 which exposes at least portions of the electrodes 210 and 220 disposed in each pixel PX or subpixel PXn. The shielding electrode layer 800 may be disposed to expose at least portions of the electrodes 210 and 220 and partially overlap the electrodes 210 and 220. The light-emitting elements 300 are aligned in an area in which the electrodes 210 and 220 are exposed, and thus, the alignment area AA is formed. In addition, the non-alignment area NAA is formed in an area other than the alignment area AA, including an area on the electrodes 210 and 220, which is covered by the shielding electrode layer 800.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In a manufacturing process of the display device 10, a process of forming an electric field on the electrodes 210 and 220 to align the light-emitting elements 300 is performed. The electric field may be formed by applying an alignment signal to the electrodes 210 and 220, and the shielding electrode layer 800 may block the electric field formed by the alignment signal. That is, the electric field may not be formed in the area of the electrodes 210 and 220 covered by the shielding electrode layer 800, and the electric field may be formed only in the exposed area of the electrodes 210 and 220 other than the covered area. Accordingly, in the manufacturing process of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> display device 10, the light-emitting elements 300 are selectively aligned in a specific area, thereby improving the alignment of the light-emitting elements 300 disposed in the display device 10.
