<p id="p0032" num="0032">Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technologies refer to carrier-free communication technologies adopting nanosecond-level non-sinusoidal wave narrow pulse transmission technologies, which have characteristics such as high transmission rate, strong anti-interference ability, cost-efficient and low power consumption, and is widely applied in sort-range high-speed data transmission scenarios.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In some scenarios, movements of the user in the space where the stereo system is placed may require the user to manually adjust the stereo system to maintain good audio effects.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Manually adjusting audio field settings of the stereo system can be inconvenient and require professional adjustment of the audio field settings of the stereo system, otherwise the audio field effect required by the user cannot be achieved.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable for an application scenario in which the audio field position of a stereo system is adjusted. In this scenario, the stereo system may be, for example, a home theater stereo system including an audio controller and a plurality of sound boxes, and the home theater stereo system supports the function of dynamically adjusting the position of the audio field.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of an audio field adjusting method according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the audio field adjusting method is applicable for a stereo system, and the method includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">At step S11, a user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes is obtained.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In the present disclosure, the audio controller in the stereo system is configured to obtain the user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">Each of the plurality of the sound boxes includes an Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) module, and the user carries a device comprising an UWB module. For example, the UWB module carried by the user may be a mobile terminal such as a smartphone installed with the UWB module, or a UWB positioning device. Each of the plurality of the sound boxes interacts with the UWB module carried by the user through the installed UWB module, to obtain a position relation between a user and the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes through the UWB module, and the position relationship with the user is send to the audio controller of the stereo system.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In addition, when determining the audio field center position, the audio controller of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> stereo system needs to perform plane modeling on the plane where the stereo system is located according to the area of the space where the stereo system is located and the initial positions of the sound boxes, in which the plane where the stereo system is located is converted into a plane grid, the sound boxes are used as nodes of the grid, and connections of adjacent sound boxes are used as edges of the grid, thus a grid-like plane is generated. The plane grid of the space where each sound box is placed in the grid-like plane is initially configured. Therefore, in order to accurately locate the model plane, the audio controller of the stereo system requires the number of the sound boxes to be greater than or equal to 3.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">At step S12, an audio field center position is determined according to the user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the present disclosure, the audio controller calculates the current location of the user based on the user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes and the initial location of each sound box configured in the audio controller, and determines the current location of the user as the audio field center position.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">At step S13, according to the audio field center position, an audio field position of each of the plurality of the sound boxes is adjusted, so that an audio field position of the stereo system is the audio field center position.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In the present disclosure, when the user is moving, the UWB modules installed in the sound boxes and the UWB module-mounted device carried by the user interact in real time to obtain the user position, so that the user position is accurate. The sound boxes feedback the user position to the stereo system, and then the stereo system obtains the accurate user position feedback by the sound boxes. Based on the user position, the stereo system determines the audio field center position, and obtains the accurate audio field center position. Based on the accurate audio field center position, by adjusting the setting parameters of an equalizer, the audio controller in the stereo system may adjust the audio field position of each sound box to obtain the audio field center position of the stereo system.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is an exemplary diagram of an audio field adjusting method according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the stereo system includes an audio controller and 6 sound boxes including sound box A-sound box F, and each sound box includes an Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) module.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">The audio controller of the stereo system performs plane modeling on the plane of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> space where the stereo system is located according to the area of the space where the stereo system is located and the initial positions of the sound boxes, that is, the plane of the space where the stereo system is located is converted into a grid. For example, the space where the stereo system is located is converted by grid side length of 0.2 meters to generate a grid-like plane. The plane grid of the space where the stereo system is located is initially configured. Sound box A to sound box F obtain the position relations d1 to d6 with the user through the installed UWB module, and sends the positional relations with the user to the audio controller. The audio controller determines the current user position according to the user positions fed back by the UWB modules in the six sound boxes and the initial grid position of the sound boxes, that is, the grid position of the plane where the current user is placed in the space. The grid position where the user is currently located is determined as the audio field center position. According to the audio field center position, the audio controller adjusts the setting parameters of the equalizer to adjust the audio field position of each sound box, so that the audio field position of the stereo system is the audio field center position.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the stereo system determines the audio field center position according to the user positions fed back by the UWB modules in each sound box, and according to the audio field center position, adjusts the audio field position of each sound box so that the audio field of the stereo system becomes the audio field center position. In the present disclosure, the audio field center position is dynamically and accurately adjusted according to the user position, and the audio field effect of the sound box is improved.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of an audio field adjusting method according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the audio field adjusting method applicable for a stereo system includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">At step S21, a user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes is obtained.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">At step S22, an audio field center position is determined according to the user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">At step S23, according to the user position re-fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes, the audio field center position is re-determined.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">In the actual scene, the user moves frequently in the space where the stereo system is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> placed. In order to ensure good sound experience of the user, the stereo system needs to be dynamically re-determine the audio field center position according to the user position fed back by the UWB module in each of the plurality of the sound boxes. Furthermore, according to the newly determined audio field center position, the audio field position of each sound box is readjusted by adjusting the setting parameters of the equalizer, so that the adjusted audio field position of the stereo system is the newly determined audio field center position.</p>
