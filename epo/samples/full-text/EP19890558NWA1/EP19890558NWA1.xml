<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a heterocyclic compound that can have an effect of inhibiting MALT1 (Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue protein 1) and is expected as useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for cancer etc.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In the major T cells and B cells responsible for cell-mediated immunity, the T-cell receptor signal and B-cell receptor signal play important roles in their function. Transduction abnormality of these signals causes various diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disease. In fact, in the case of cancer, it has been reported that genetic analysis of patients with T cell-derived leukemia lymphoma such as ATL (adult T cell leukemia lymphoma), which is one of refractory lymphomas, reveals a genetic abnormality in the T-cell receptor signal/NF-κB pathway, and that the B-cell receptor signaling pathway/NF-κB pathway is also persistently activated in other B-cell lymphomas such as ABC-type DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and MCL (mantle cell lymphoma).</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">A CBM protein complex in which these T-cell and B-cell receptor signals merge is composed of a scaffold protein CARD11, an adapter protein BCL10, and a MALT1 having paracaspase activity. The formation of the CBM protein complex is promoted by the T-cell receptor signal and the B-cell receptor signal, leading to an enhancement of the paracaspase activity of MALT1 and activating the transcription factor NF-κB.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, an inhibitor that inhibits the activity of MALT1 is expected to be able to correct the enhancement of the activity of MALT1 caused by abnormalities in T-cell receptor signal and B-cell receptor signal, and is considered to be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for cancer, inflammatory disease and the like caused by the activity of MALT1.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The compound of the present invention is expected to be useful for prevention or treatment of diseases that may be affected by MALT1 (occasionally abbreviated as "MALT1-related diseases" in the description). It is expected to be useful for prevention or treatment of diseases including, but not limited to, cancer [for example, colorectal cancer (e.g., colon cancer, rectal cancer, anal cancer, familial colorectal cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor), lung cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma), mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer (e.g., pancreatic ductal cancer and pancreatic endocrine tumor), pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer (e.g., papillary adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma), duodenal cancer, small intestine cancer, breast cancer (e.g., invasive ductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer (e.g., epithelial ovarian cancer, extragonadal germ cell tumor, ovarian germ cell tumor and low-grade ovarian tumor), testicular cancer, prostate cancer (e.g., hormone-dependent prostate cancer, hormone-independent prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer), liver cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, primary liver cancer and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), thyroid cancer (e.g., medullary thyroid cancer), renal cancer (e.g., renal cell carcinoma (e.g., clear cell renal cell carcinoma), transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter), uterine<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cancer (e.g., cervical cancer, endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma), gestational choriocarcinoma, brain tumor (e.g., medulloblastoma, glioma, pineal astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and pituitary adenoma), retinoblastoma, skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma (e.g., melanoma)), sarcomas (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma and osteosarcoma), malignant bone tumor, bladder cancer, hematological cancer (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukemia (e.g., acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia)), malignant lymphoma (e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and chronic myeloproliferative disorder), Hodgkin's disease, and cancer of unknown primary], inhibition of cancer growth, suppression of metastasis, promotion of apoptosis, or prevention or treatment of precancerous lesion (e.g., bone marrow atypia syndrome).<br/>
In addition, the compound of the present invention is expected to be useful for prevention or treatment of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases (e.g., encephalomyelitis, colitis, atopic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus), bone disease, metabolic disease, neurological disease and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease, hormone-related disease, inflammatory disease, viral infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency viral infections), and bacterial infection (e.g., sepsis).</p>

<p id="p0376" num="0376">To a solution of 2-methyl-8-(propan-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine-7-carboxylic acid (80 mg) and triethylamine (0.15 mL) in toluene (10 mL) was added diphenylphosphoryl azide (0.09 mL). After the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 40 minutes, 5-chloro-6-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)pyridine-3-amine (71 mg) obtained in Reference Example 3 was added, followed by stirring at 100°C for 2 hours. The resultant reaction mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated saline, dried over magnesium sulfate, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane), and suspended in and washed with ethyl acetate/hexane to yield the title compound (83 mg).</p>

<heading id="h0100">Preparation of recombinant human MALT1 protein</heading>
<p id="p0381" num="0381">On the human MALT1 gene, PCR was carried out using GC-030-D09 (pENTR221/MALT1, GeneCopoeia) as a template with primers having BamH I restriction enzyme at the N-terminal and Not I restriction enzyme at the C-terminal to form a human MALT1 (340-789aa) dimer. On the leucine zipper gene of yeast GCN4, PCR was carried out using yeast DNA as a template with primers having Nde I restriction enzyme at the N-terminal, and a linker sequence<br/>
(GGAAGTGGCTCAGGTAGC (SEQ ID NO: 1)) and BamH I restriction enzyme at the C-terminal to yield yeast GCN4 (251-281aa). Both of the obtained fragments were treated with the restriction enzymes, and inserted between Nde I and Not I of a pET28a (Novagen) vector to yield a recombinant human MALT1 protein expression vector pET28a/His-LZ-hMALT1v1 (340-789)-His.</p>
<p id="p0382" num="0382">The recombinant human MALT1 protein was prepared by transforming the expression plasmid prepared as above with ECOS Competent E. coli BL21 (DE3)<!-- EPO <DP n="130"> --> (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.). Escherichia coli obtained by transformation was inoculated into 300 mL of LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium chloride, 0.01% ampicillin) and cultured at 30°C for 16 hours. The obtained culture solution was transplanted into ajar culture tank containing 6 L of a main fermentation medium (0.3% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.6% disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1% ammonium chloride, 0.05% sodium chloride, 0.024% magnesium sulfate, 0.01% Antifoam PE-L, 1.5% sorbitol, 1.5% casamino acid, 0.5% yeast extract and 0.01% ampicillin), and the culturing was started at 37°C, aeration rate of 5 L/min, and stirring rotation speed of 400 rpm. When the turbidity of the culture solution reached about 500 Klett units, the culture temperature was lowered to 16°C, and then isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Furthermore, culturing was carried out for 16 hours to induce expression of human MALT1 protein. After completion of the culture, the culture solution was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes. After suspending the obtained human MALT1 protein-expressing Escherichia coli in a buffer solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5 U/ml benzonase, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol and 0.1% NP-40, sonication was carried out using Sonifier (Branson). This crushed liquid was centrifuged (15,300 × G, 30 min, TOMY MX-301), and the obtained supernatant was passed through and adsorbed to a Ni-NTA Superflow (QIAGEN) column previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol, followed by elution in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 250 mM imidazole. Furthermore, gel filtration was carried out on a Superdex 200 pg column previously equilibrated with a buffer solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol to collect a target fraction, and equal amounts of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150<!-- EPO <DP n="131"> --> mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 90% glycerol were added to yield purified human MALT1 protein. The prepared protein was stored at -30°C, and the protein concentration was measured with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (PIERCE) using BSA as a standard.</p>
<heading id="h0101">Measurement of MALT 1 enzyme inhibitory activity</heading>
<p id="p0383" num="0383">To a 384 well black plate (Greiner) was added 2 µL of a compound solution diluted with an assay buffer ((20 mM HEPES (Dojin Laboratories), 10 mM KCl (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.), 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM DTT (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.)). Subsequently, 2 µL of a purified recombinant human MALT1 enzyme solution was added, followed by incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature. To the mixture were added 2 µL of a substrate solution (75 µM Ac-LRSR-AFC (SM Biochemicals), 20 mM HEPES (Dojin Laboratories), 10 mM KCl (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.), 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM DTT (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), followed by incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature. The fluorescence values of excitation 400 nm and emission 485 nm immediately after substrate addition and after enzymatic reaction were measured with a plate reader Envision (PerkinElmer), and the fluorescence values increased by enzymatic reaction were used for calculation of the inhibition rate (%). The inhibition rate (%) was calculated regarding the value without enzyme addition as 100% and the value without compound addition as 0%.</p>
