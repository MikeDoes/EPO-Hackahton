<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pigmentation skin model and to a method for producing it. The invention also relates to a method for evaluating factors for treatment or prevention of skin pigmentation using the pigmentation skin model.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The skin is an organ that covers the surface of the body, separating the interior of the body from its exterior. Skin functions as a physical barrier and protects the interior of the body from dryness and infiltration of hazardous substances, thus performing an indispensable role for life maintenance.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The skin of higher vertebrates primarily consists of the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue layers, in that order from the outermost layer. The epidermis is composed mainly of cells known as keratinocytes, the keratinocytes dividing at the deepest part (basal lamina) of the epidermis while migrating to the surface and differentiating toward the upper layer into the stratum spinosum, granular layer and stratum corneum, eventually being shed as old skin.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Melanocytes are present in the basal lamina of the epidermis, with melanin being produced by melanosomes inside the melanocytes. The melanin that is produced is taken up into the surrounding keratinocytes. After being taken up, the melanin migrates to the stratum corneum with turnover of keratinocytes, being discharged out of the body over a period of about 40 days.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">It is thought that pigmentation of skin, such as skin spots and freckles, is caused by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> overproduction of melanin by melanocytes due to hormone imbalance, ultraviolet ray exposure or local inflammation, and by deposition of melanin granules inside keratinocytes in the basal epidermal layer. Methods and agents (skin whiteners) for treatment or prevention of pigmentation such as senile pigmentation spots have been developed, but these have not provided the anticipated effects or have only exhibited temporary effects, resulting in relapse without continual use, and therefore an ongoing demand exists to develop new methods of treatment and prevention, and new therapeutic agents.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In light of this situation, pigmentation skin models are recently being developed and used which simulate skin structure and function, as substitutes for conventional animal models in order to develop new methods of treatment (PTL 1, for example).</p>

<heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h0006">[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]</heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Conventional pigmentation skin models have had varying levels of pigmentation between prepared models and have been difficult to culture in a stable manner for prolonged periods. This is the case because the method of preparation involves directly seeding an epidermal cell group that includes keratinocytes or melanocytes onto the dermis model, causing the quality of the dermis model to have a major effect on formation of the epidermis layer, while procedures such as separation of the dermis model and epidermis model for alteration of the conditions, or transferring of the epidermis model to a different dermis model, cannot be carried out during the course of maintenance culture of the pigmentation skin model, thereby restricting the scope of possible experimentation. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a novel pigmentation skin model that can be stably cultured for long periods, and a method for its production, as well as to allow the pigmentation skin model to have the conditions altered for the dermis model or epidermis model alone, or to have the dermis model and epidermis model freely<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> transferred, during the course of maintenance culturing. It is also another object of the invention to provide a method for evaluating factors for treatment or prevention of skin pigmentation using the novel pigmentation skin model.</p>

<heading id="h0011">&lt;Pigmentation skin model and method for its production&gt;</heading>
<p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a pigmentation skin model 1 and a method for its production, according to an embodiment of the invention. For this embodiment the pigmentation skin model 1 comprises:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>a first cell group 100 that includes fibroblasts that have been damaged by photoirradiation, seeded on a first cell culturing substrate 11; and</li>
<li>a second cell group that includes melanocytes and keratinocytes 200, applied onto the first cell group 100 (see <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1(D)</figref>, for example).</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The pigmentation skin model 1 of this embodiment can be provided by a method that comprises the following steps:
<ol id="ol0005" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(1) culturing the first cell group 100 that includes fibroblasts that have been damaged by photoirradiation,</li>
<li>(2) culturing the first cell group 100 obtained in step (1) on the first cell culturing substrate 11, and</li>
<li>(3) applying the second cell group 200 that includes melanocytes and keratinocytes on the first cell group 100 obtained in step (2), and culturing it.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Throughout the present specification, the structure of the pigmentation skin model 1 comprising the first cell group 100 and third cell group 100a may be referred to as "dermis model" (first dermis model or second dermis model) since it models the structure of the skin dermis. Also throughout the present specification, the structure comprising the pigmentation skin model 1 containing the second cell group 200 may be referred to as "epidermis model" since it models the structure of the skin epidermis.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The pigmentation skin model 1 may have a structure with the second cell group 200 directly seeded or layered on the first cell group 100, or it may have a structure as shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, having a space formed between the second cell group 200 and first cell group 100, in which medium is present. In the latter case, the second cell group 200 is preferably seeded on a porous membrane (corresponding to the second porous membrane 210 of <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) in such a manner that liquid components secreted by the first cell group 100 and second cell group 200 can mutually<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> pass through.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In step (3) of the method of producing the pigmentation skin model 1 according to one embodiment, the step of applying the second cell group 200 that includes melanocytes and keratinocytes onto the first cell group 100 obtained in step (2) may be a step of directly seeding or layering the second cell group 200 on the first cell group 100, or it may be a step in which the second cell group 200 that has been seeded on a second cell culturing substrate 21 having a porous membrane is applied onto the first cell group 100.</p>

<p id="p0032" num="0032">The fibroblasts used in the first cell group 100 are fibroblasts that have been damaged by photoirradiation. The fibroblasts damaged by photoirradiation are preferably ones that have been damaged by photoirradiation in the presence of a photosensitizer. Examples of photosensitizers to be used include psoralen, NAD, riboflavin, tryptophan, folic acid, porphyrin, methylene blue, and thiol group-protected gold nanoclusters (AUxSRy). By using a photosensitizer it is possible to cause sensitization to the irradiated light and more efficiently induce damage in the fibroblasts.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The light used to induce damage in the fibroblasts may have a wavelength which causes damage in intracellular nucleic acid such as DNA or RNA but does not result in death of all of the cells, and it is preferably ultraviolet light (about 200 nm to about 400 nm), and more preferably UVA (about 320 nm to about 400 nm). The intensity of the irradiated light may be such as to produce damage in the intracellular nucleic acid such as DNA or RNA while not inducing apoptosis and death in all of the cells, and it can be appropriately adjusted by the wavelength or irradiation time, and the cell density.

Fibroblasts that have suffered damage by photoirradiation have elongated cellular forms and reduced proliferation potency, as well as increased production of melanin-producing factors (such as stem cell growth factor (SCF), and thus an increased level of cell senescence (see <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). The level of senescence of cells can be examined by measuring expression levels of commonly known cell senescence markers such as senescent acidic β-galactosidase (SA-βgal), constitutive activation of cell cycle check mechanisms such as the p21/p53 pathway or p16 pathway, or expression levels of cell senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors such as IL-6. Adjustment of the photoirradiation dose allows fibroblasts with the desired level of senescence to be obtained.</p>

<p id="p0041" num="0041">The invention can provide a method for evaluating factors for treatment or prevention of skin pigmentation using the pigmentation skin model. According to one embodiment, the method of the invention comprises:
<ol id="ol0006" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(1) applying a candidate factor to a pigmentation skin model 1 and culturing it, and</li>
<li>(2) evaluating the treatment or prevention effect of the candidate factor, using the extent of pigment production and/or pigmentation in the pigmentation skin model 1 as an indicator.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">According to another embodiment, candidate factors include low molecular compounds, peptides, nucleic acids, proteins, mammalian animal (such as mouse, rat, porcine, bovine, sheep, monkey or human) cells, tissue extracts or cell culture supernatants, plant-derived compounds or<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> extracts (such as galenical extracts or galenical-derived compounds), and microbial compounds or extracts, or culture products.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">A candidate substance may be added to the pigmentation skin model 1 and culturing carried out for a predetermined time period, and then the extent of pigment production and/or pigmentation in the pigmentation skin model 1 may be measured to evaluate the treatment or prevention effect that the candidate substance has on pigmentation. For example, it is possible to compare the extent of pigment production and/or pigmentation in a pigmentation skin model 1 without addition of a candidate substance, and with addition of a substance that does not have a treatment or prevention effect on pigmentation, and when the extent of pigment production and/or pigmentation in the pigmentation skin model 1 with the added candidate substance is higher, the candidate substance may be evaluated as having a treatment or prevention effect on pigmentation.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">As used herein, "pigment production" refers to production of a pigment such as melanin pigment, which is produced by the pigmentation skin model. Melanin pigment is produced primarily by melanocytes. The amount of pigment production can be determined as the amount of melanin, by extracting the melanin pigment from the pigmentation skin model, and especially the second cell group (keratinocytes and melanocytes), and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. The amount of pigment production can be measured as the level of melanin or nucleic acid (such as mRNA) coding therefor, present in the pigmentation skin model and particularly the second cell group (keratinocytes and melanocytes), using a method such as ELISA, flow cytometry, Western blotting, an immunohistochemical method or qPCR, with no limitation to these.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">As used herein, "extent of pigmentation" means the color brightness of the pigmentation skin model, and particularly the second cell group (keratinocytes and melanocytes), under visible light. The pigmentation skin model of the invention has varying brightness depending on the amount of melanin produced by the melanocytes. A greater amount of melanin results in reduced brightness, so that the pigmentation skin model exhibits a darker color. A lower amount of melanin, conversely, increases the brightness and causes the pigmentation skin model to exhibit a lighter color. That is, the treatment or prevention effect on pigmentation by an added candidate substance can be evaluated by comparing the color brightness of the pigmentation skin<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> model. The brightness can be quantified by recording the pigmentation skin model as an image and using publicly known image measuring means.</p>

The candidate factor on the substrate used in step (3) (such as the third cell culturing substrate 11a in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2(E) and (F)</figref>) may be, for example, a low molecular compound, peptide, nucleic acid or protein, a mammalian animal (such as mouse, rat, porcine, bovine, sheep, monkey or human) cells, a tissue extract or cell culture supernatant, plant-derived compound or extract (such as a galenical extract or galenical-derived compound), a microbial compound or extract, or a culture product.
