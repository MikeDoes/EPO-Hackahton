<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition comprising a linear perfluoropolyether compound containing at least two azide groups per molecule and a linear perfluoropolyether compound containing at least three ethynyl (-C≡C-H) groups per molecule, and a cured product thereof. More particularly, it relates to a perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition which is characterized in that the curable composition comprising the aforementioned compounds cures through crosslinking reaction (formation of a triazole structure by means of click reaction) that takes place upon heating or in that the composition further comprising (c) a transition metal catalyst cures through the formation of a triazole structure by means of click reaction that takes place at room temperature (23°C±10°C), the composition providing a cured product having improved heat resistance, organic solvent resistance, and chemical resistance, especially acid resistance, a cured product thereof, and an article comprising the cured product.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND ART</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Because of a good profile of heat resistance, low-temperature performance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, and oil resistance, heat curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions are used in a wide variety of applications, typically in the automotive industry, as disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 3 (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001192546A"><text>JP-A 2001-192546</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000248166A"><text>JP-A 2000-248166</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002020615A"><text>JP-A 2002-020615</text></patcit>). Mostly known are heat curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions adapted to cure through crosslinking reaction in the form of hydrosilylation in the presence of a metal base catalyst, typically platinum base catalyst.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Of the heat curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions, an exemplary composition comprising a perfluoropolyether-based compound terminated with a skeleton: [aromatic ring-silicon atom-vinyl group] as the base polymer is known. The composition sometimes exhibits low chemical resistance, especially low acid resistance because the skeleton: [aromatic ring-silicon atom] is unstable. It is known from Patent Document 4 (<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP6160540B"><text>JP 6160540</text></patcit>) that this problem can be ameliorated by using a perfluoropolyether-based compound terminated with [amide group (having aromatic substituent as pendant)-alkylene group-silicon atom-vinyl group] as the base polymer. Although the rubber composition and a cured product thereof are surely improved in sulfuric acid resistance, a hardening degradation tendency is sometimes observed with respect to nitric acid resistance. In view of the expansion of their application to adhesives or the like, such degradation is undesirable because it leads to a likelihood of interfacial peeling.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, the heat curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions which cure through crosslinking reaction in the form of hydrosilylation may encounter a cure failure in the presence of a substance containing phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen or similar atom. Since heat is necessary to obtain cured products, these compositions are unsuitable to apply to large-size parts which are too large to place in heating ovens or heat-sensitive parts. As the perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition that overcomes these drawbacks, room temperature curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions of condensation cure type are proposed in Patent Documents 5 and 6 (<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JPH09077944A"><text>JP-A H09-077944</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JPH09137027A"><text>JP-A H09-137027</text></patcit>). Not only these compositions cure into cured products without a need for heating, but the cured products also have improved properties including heat resistance, low-temperature performance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, and oil resistance. However, the prior art well-known room temperature curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions of dealcoholization condensation cure type are readily degraded under such conditions as long-term exposure to acid because of low acid resistance of siloxane bonds.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Under the circumstances, there is a strong need for curable (both heat curable and room temperature curable) perfluoropolyether-based rubber compositions having improved chemical resistance, especially acid resistance.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>

<p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the invention, which has been made under the above-mentioned circumstances, is to provide a perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition capable of providing a cured product having improved heat resistance, low-temperature properties (freeze resistance), organic solvent resistance, and chemical resistance, especially acid resistance, a cured product thereof, and an article comprising the cured product.</p>
<heading id="h0007"><u>SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</u></heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">It is known that a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azide and alkyne to form a triazole structure takes place at elevated temperature and the same reaction takes place even at room temperature when a catalyst of transition metal such as copper is added. This reaction is well known as Huisgen cycloaddition reaction or click reaction. Making extensive investigations to attain the above object with a focus on the use of this reaction, the inventors have found that a heat curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition comprising (a) a linear perfluoropolyether compound containing at least two azide groups per molecule and a divalent perfluoroalkylether structure in its main chain, and having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 100,000 and (b) a linear perfluoropolyether compound containing at least three ethynyl (-C≡C-H) groups per molecule provides a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> cured product having improved heat resistance, freeze resistance, solvent resistance, and chemical resistance, especially acid resistance and has improved curing properties at elevated temperature. It has also been found that a room temperature curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition obtained by adding (c) a transition metal catalyst to components (a) and (b) has improved curing properties at room temperature. The invention is predicated on these findings.</p>

<heading id="h0019">[Substance for reducing copper salt]</heading>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">Huisgen cycloaddition reaction (click reaction) starts with reaction of monovalent copper with acetylene. However, since monovalent copper is often unstable, it is sometimes oxidized in part into inert divalent copper as by-product. This suggests that once a reducing agent is added to reduce the copper from divalent to monovalent form, the copper resumes a reactive catalyst function again. Suitable substances for reducing component (c), especially copper complex include sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid. Since these substances are in powder or granular form, they may be dissolved in a suitable solvent prior to addition. The type of solvent is not particularly limited as long as the above compound is dissolvable therein.

<heading id="h0020">[Nitrogen-based ligand for activating crosslinking reaction]</heading>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">It is known that Huisgen cycloaddition reaction (click reaction) is activated by adding a nitrogen-based compound (ligand) which coordinates to the copper salt so that the reaction is completed in a shorter time. Therefore, the curing time can sometimes be reduced by adding the nitrogen-based compound (ligand) to the room temperature curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition comprising component (c). Suitable nitrogen-based ligands for activating crosslinking reaction include compounds having at least one skeleton selected from primary amines, secondary amines, tertiary amines, imidazoles, and triazoles.

<p id="p0094" num="0094">The perfluoroether-based rubber composition of the invention is obtained as one-part type composition by intimately mixing components (a) and (b). Alternatively, the composition may be constructed as two-part type composition wherein components (a) and (b) are kept separate. In this case, they may be mixed for use when needed. When the room temperature-curable perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition of the invention is constructed as two-part type composition wherein components (a) and (b) are kept separate, component (c) may be combined with either component (a) or component (b), or with both component (a) and component (b).</p>
<heading id="h0023">[Cured product]</heading>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">The perfluoropolyether-based rubber cured product of the invention may be obtained by heat curing the inventive perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition comprising components (a) and (b) in such amounts that the amount of ethynyl groups in component (b) is predetermined moles, specifically 0.5 to 2.0 moles per mole of total azide groups in component (a), at 100°C to 150°C preferably for about 1.5 to 9 hours.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p>

While the inventive perfluoropolyether-based rubber composition which is curable at room temperature finds use in a wide variety of perfluoropolyether-based rubber applications, it is particularly useful in such applications as large-size parts which are too large to place in heating ovens or heat-sensitive parts that should not be heated because of their relationship to the surrounding members.</p>
