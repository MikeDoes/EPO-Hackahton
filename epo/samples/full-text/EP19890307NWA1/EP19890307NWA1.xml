<p id="pa01" num="0001">Provided is an anti-PD-Ll antibody preparation, comprising an anti-PD-Ll antibody, a buffer solution and sodium chloride, without added sugars and/or sugar alcohols.

</abstract>
<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of therapeutic antibodies. More specifically, the invention relates to an anti-PD-L1 antibody preparation and medical use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">PD-1 (Programmed Death 1), with the full name of programmed death receptor 1, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to members of the CD28 family. PD-L1 (Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1), with the full name of programmed death receptor-ligand 1, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a size of 40KDa.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Under normal physiological conditions, after an antigen enters the body, it is processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and connected with MHC. TCR molecules on the surface of T cells specifically recognize antigen peptides presented by APCs, and at the same time recognize MHC molecules that form complexes with antigen peptides. In addition, numerous immunomodulatory molecules on the surface of T cells participate in the response to generate costimulatory signals, promoting T cell activation and exerting immunological effects. PD-1 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and DCs, which interacts with PD-L1 and PD-L2, etc. on the surface of APC cells to transmit inhibitory signals, inhibit the activation of T cells, and maintain the body's immune homeostasis. High expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells in combination with high expression of PD-1 of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes lead to continuous activation of the PD-1 pathway, thereby inhibiting T cell activation and resulting in immune escape of tumors. Therefore, blocking the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 has become one of the important strategies in the field of tumor immunotherapy. PD-L1 antibodies can block the binding of PD-L1 on tumors and PD-1 on T cells to eliminate this immunosuppressive effect, so that T cells are reactivated to recognize and kill tumor cells.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2017148424A"><text>WO2017/148424</text></patcit> discloses new anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, which can effectively block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1, and show better therapeutic effects on tumors or anemia. Nevertheless, the use of PD-L1 antibody in clinical treatment needs to solve the problems of physical and chemical properties suitable for administration and stability during storage. Antibody preparation is the final form of antibody in storage, transportation and clinical treatment, which needs to take into account its physical and chemical properties, physiological properties and stability within the validity period, such as protein content, pH, osmotic pressure,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> insoluble particles, purity, aggregates, binding activity, etc. As different antibodies have their own characteristics in terms of physical and chemical properties, and their stability varies greatly, it is difficult to obtain a stable and universal liquid formulation when preparing preparations. Therefore, for each innovatively developed antibody, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research to find a suitable formulation to obtain an antibody preparation with good physiological compatibility for the convenience of drug storage and clinical application.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, for anti-PD-Ll antibodies, it is necessary to develop appropriate formulations to obtain antibody preparations that satisfy the requirements for physiological compatibility and stability.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>

The high-concentration protein preparation overcomes the problems of poor stability, high viscosity and easy turbidity. Accordingly, the present application discloses a liquid preparation that is particularly advantageous for long-term storage and clinical use of drugs, thereby completing the invention.</p>

<heading id="h0006"><b><u>Definition of terms</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">In the invention, unless otherwise specified, the scientific and technical terms used herein have the meanings as commonly understood by those skilled in the art. In addition, the pharmacy, biochemistry, nucleic acid chemistry, immunology laboratory and other operating procedures used herein are all routine procedures widely used in the corresponding fields. In the meantime, in order to better understand the invention, definitions and explanations of related terms are provided below.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">As used herein, the term "antibody" (Ab) shall include, but is not limited to, an immunoglobulin that specifically binds to an antigen and comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated as VH herein) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated as VL herein) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region comprises a constant domain CL. The VH and VL regions can further be subdivided into regions with hypervariability (called complementarity determining regions (CDRs)), interspersed with more conservative regions (called framework regions (FRs)). Each VH and VL is composed of 3 CDRs and 4 FRs arranged in the following order from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions of each heavy chain/light chain pair (VH and VL) form an antigen binding site separately. Based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region and the amino acid sequence of the framework region of the variable region, the heavy chain can be classified as µ, δ, γ, α, or ε, and the isotype of the antibody is defined as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE, respectively, and "light chain" is divided into two strict types: kappa (κ) and lambda (λ).</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">The term "antibody" includes, for example, naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring antibodies; monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies; chimeric and humanized<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> antibodies; human or non-human antibodies; and fully synthetic antibodies. Non-human antibodies can be humanized by recombinant methods to reduce their immunogenicity in humans. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the "antibody" used herein should be understood to comprise an intact antibody molecule, i.e., immunoglobulin IgG.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The term "anti-PD-Ll antibody" refers to an antibody capable of specifically binding PD-L1. The term "specifically binding" means that the antibody and the antigen form a relatively stable complex under physiological conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 1×10<sup>-9</sup> M or less. Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind each other are well-known in the art, such as bioluminescence interferometry or surface plasmon resonance technology (such as Biacore). Anti-PD-Ll antibodies (intact antibody molecules) suitable for use in the liquid preparations disclosed herein are presented in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2017148424A"><text>PCT Patent Publication No. WO2017/148424</text></patcit>, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain preferred embodiments, the anti-PD-Ll antibody described herein comprises the heavy chain CDRs as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1-3 respectively, and the light chain CDRs as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 4-6, respectively. In certain preferred embodiments, the anti-PD-Ll antibody described herein has a heavy chain variable region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 and a light chain variable region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 8. In certain preferred embodiments, the anti-PD-Ll antibody described herein has a heavy chain as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 and a light chain as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10.

Bioeng., 100: 1132-1143</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">As used herein, the term "programmed death-1 (PD-1)" refers to an immunosuppressive receptor belonging to the CD28 family. PD-1 is mainly expressed on previously activated T cells <i>in vivo</i> and binds to two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. The complete hPD-1 sequence can be found under GenBank accession number U64863. Accordingly, the term "programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)" is one of the two cell-surface glycoprotein ligands of PD-1 (the other is PD-L2), which down regulates T cell activation and cytokine secretion when binding to PD-1. The term "PD-L1" as used herein includes human PD-L1 (h PD-L1), variants, isoforms, and species homologs of h PD-L1, as well as analogs having at least one epitope in common with h PD-L1. The complete h PD-L1 sequence can be found under GenBank accession number Q9NZQ7.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">As used herein, the term "liquid preparation" represents a combination of at least one active ingredient (for example, an antibody, which is capable of exerting biological activity in a subject) and at least one inactive ingredient, and the inactive ingredient should be suitable for<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> administration to a subject upon combined with the active ingredient. Typically, the liquid preparation does not comprise ingredients with unacceptable toxicity to the subject to whom the preparation is to be administrated. Herein, the subject may include mammals, preferably humans.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">As used herein, the expression "stability" of an antibody means that an antibody substantially retains its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity after storage. The storage period is generally selected based on the intended shelf life of the preparation. Analytical techniques for measuring antibody stability are well known in the art, and stability can be determined at a selected temperature for a selected time period (for example, the stability of the antibody is tested during storage at 40°C for at least 28 days, or stability of the antibody is tested during storage at 5°C±3°C for at least 12 months).</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">For physical stability, the antibody in the preparation is considered to maintain its physical stability if it shows no obvious signs of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation by visual inspection of color and/or transparency, or by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">For chemical stability, it can be evaluated by testing and quantifying the chemically altered form of the antibody. Chemical alterations may involve size changes (e.g., cleavage), which, for example, can be assessed by using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and/or matrix-assisted laser resolution ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS). Other types of chemical alterations include charge changes (for example, changes due to deamidation), which can be assessed by ion exchange chromatography, for example.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">For biological activity, if the antibody in a preparation has the biological activity for its intended use, the antibody retains its biological activity in the preparation. For example, if the biological activity of the antibody in the preparation is within about 70% to 130% (e.g., 80% to 130%) of the biological activity shown during the preparation of the preparation, it is considered that its biological activity is maintained (e.g., determined by antigen binding assay).</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">As used herein, the term "buffer" refers to a buffer solution that resists changes in pH through the action of its acid-base conjugated components. Examples of such buffers include acetate, succinate, gluconate, histidine, citrate, glycylglycine and other organic acid buffers. In certain preferred embodiments, the buffer suitable for use in the liquid preparations disclosed herein is selected from citric acid-citrate buffer, histidine buffer, and acetic acid-acetate buffer.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The term "histidine buffer" refers to a buffer containing histidine. The histidine in the buffer may be present alone or in the following forms: for example, histidine hydrochloride,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> histidine acetate, histidine phosphate or histidine sulfate. When the histidine is not present alone, the amino acid buffer (such as histidine hydrochloride buffer) can be prepared by titrating L-histidine (free base, solid) with corresponding acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid). When histidine is present in a separate form, a pH adjusting agent may be added in the subsequent preparation steps according to actual conditions to obtain a liquid preparation with a suitable pH range. In certain preferred embodiments, the histidine in the histidine buffer suitable for use in the liquid preparations disclosed herein is present alone or in the form of histidine hydrochloride or histidine acetate.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The term "citric acid-citrate buffer" includes a mixture of citric acid and citrate. In certain preferred embodiments, the citric acid-citrate buffer is a citric acid-sodium citrate buffer, that is, it contains a mixture of citric acid and sodium citrate. The citric acid-citrate buffer (e.g., citric acid-sodium citrate buffer) can be prepared by adding alkali (such as sodium hydroxide) required for salt formation to citric acid.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The term "acetic acid-acetate buffer" includes a mixture of acetic acid and acetate. In certain preferred embodiments, the acetic acid-acetate buffer is an acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer, that is, it contains a mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate. The acetic acid-acetate buffer (e.g., acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer) can be prepared by adding alkali (such as sodium hydroxide) required for salt formation to acetic acid.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">As used herein, the term "sugar" or "sugar alcohol" has the meaning commonly understood by those skilled in the art. Sugar includes the general composition (CH<sub>2</sub>O)n and its derivatives, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, polysaccharides, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars, etc., and non-limiting examples of which herein include glucose, sucrose, trehalose, lactose, fructose, maltose, dextran, etc. Sugar alcohol can be prepared and obtained from the corresponding sugar, that is, the aldehyde group or ketone group on the sugar molecule is reduced into a hydroxyl group to obtain the sugar alcohol; a sugar alcohol has the general formula H(CHOH)nH, and non-limiting examples of which herein include erythritol, threitol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, lactitol, etc.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">The anti-PD-L1 antibody liquid preparation of the invention does not contain sugar and/or sugar alcohol, so that the preparation can also be referred to as a sugar-free antibody preparation herein. In certain preferred embodiments, the anti-PD-Ll antibody liquid preparation of the invention does not contain a sugar and/or a sugar alcohol selected from the group consisting of sucrose, trehalose, glucose, mannitol and sorbitol. It is known in the art that sugars and/or sugar alcohols (e.g., sucrose, trehalose, glucose, mannitol, and sorbitol, etc.) are usually added to antibody preparations as antibody stabilizers. In addition, sugars and/or sugar<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> alcohols can also serve as effective osmotic pressure adjusting agents to maintain the stability of the preparation (e.g., isotonic, that is, having substantially the same osmotic pressure as human blood).</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">As used herein, the term "osmolality" refers to a measure of the osmotic pressure of dissolved solute particles in an aqueous solution. Solute particles include two kinds of ions and non-ionized molecules. Osmotic pressure is represented as the concentration of osmotically active particles (i.e., osmole) dissolved in 1 kg of solvent (i.e., water). Herein, the osmolality is represented in the unit of millosmoles per kilogram of water (mOsmol/kg). It is known to those skilled in the art that a desired level of osmolality can be achieved by adding one or more osmotic pressure adjusting agents, such as sugars and/or sugar alcohols.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">As used herein, the term "isotonic" means that the preparation of interest has substantially the same osmotic pressure as human blood. In certain preferred embodiments, the isotonic preparation would generally have an osmotic pressure of about 260-330 mOsmol/kg. Isotonicity can be measured using, for example, a vapor pressure or a freezing-type osmometer.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">As used herein, the term "mass to volume ratio" or "w/v" refers to the percentage weight (in grams) of a single component relative to the total volume (in milliliters) of the mixture containing the component. For example, 20 mg component in a total volume of 100 ml is 0.02% w/v.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">As used herein, the term "about" refers to a value or composition within an acceptable error range for a specific value or composition determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value or composition is measured or determined, i.e., the limitation of the measurement system. Herein, "about" means a range comprising ±5% of the given value when it is used to describe a measurable value (e.g., the concentration of a substance, time, temperature, etc.). For example, the expression "about 10mM" means 9.5-10.5 mM.</p>
<heading id="h0007"><b><u>The beneficial effects of the invention</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">In the process of preparing antibody preparations, it is usually necessary in the art to add sugar and/or sugar alcohol to maintain the stability of the antibody. However, the use of sugar and/or sugar alcohol has certain limitations for patients with diabetes. The inventors of the present application have, after a large number of experiments, unexpectedly discovered that the sugar-free antibody preparation of the invention can not only maintain the osmotic pressure of the antibody preparation to obtain excellent physiological compatibility, but also maintain the physical stability, chemical stability and biological activity of the preparation. It can tolerate<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> severe conditions during storage and transportation, which is particularly advantages for long-term storage of drugs, and can expand the scope of clinical medication, which has great clinical value.</p>

<heading id="h0011"><b><u>Test methods</u></b></heading>
<heading id="h0012">(1) Protein concentration</heading>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">The protein concentration in the sample is determined by taking about 30µl of sample and placing it in a cuvette followed by measuring the UV absorbance using a Solo-VPE variable optical path ultraviolet spectrophotometer.</p>
<heading id="h0013">(2) Flowcam</heading>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">The number of particles in the sample is determined using Flowcam GWF-8JD. About 1 ml of the sample is taken using a pipette, and the tip containing the sample is placed on the sample port to determine the number of insoluble particles ≥10 µm and ≥25 µm in the sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p>
<heading id="h0014">(3) Osmotic pressure</heading>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">25 µl of the sample is taken and placed in the sample tube, which is then placed under the probe of 819M freezing point osmotic pressure meter (Loser) to measure the osmotic pressure of the sample.</p>
<heading id="h0015">(4) Size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC)</heading>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">The processed sample is injected and eluted in the mobile phase for about 20 mins on Waters e2695 HPLC using TSKgel G3000SWXL column with the column temperature kept at room temperature. The distribution of large and small molecules in the sample is determined by size exclusion chromatography. The sample curve is obtained based on the UV absorption at 280 nm, and the relative percentage peak area of the total area is reported as the result.</p>
<heading id="h0016">(5) Ion exchange chromatography (IEC-HPLC)</heading>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">The processed sample is injected and eluted in the mobile phase on Waters e2695 HPLC using ProPac WCX-10 column with the column temperature kept at 30°C. The distribution of different charged ion components in the sample is determined by ion exchange chromatography. The sample curve is obtained based on the UV absorption at 280 nm, and the relative percentage peak area of the total area is reported as the result.</p>
<heading id="h0017">(6) Capillary electrophoresis (CE-SDS)</heading>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">After the sample is processed, it is quantitatively determined for the purity of the recombinant monoclonal antibody product based on the molecular weight under non-reduced (NR) conditions, using sodium dodecyl sulfate capillary electrophoresis (CE-SDS) ultraviolet test method.</p>
<heading id="h0018">(7) Relative binding activity (%)</heading>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">The EC50 (half effective concentration) of the sample is tested by establishing an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). By comparing the EC50 of the sample and the reference, the relative binding activity of the sample is calculated. Since the detection deviation of this method is ±20%, the standard is initially determined to be 70-130%.</p>

<p id="p0096" num="0096">The preparation methods of the antibody preparations of Formulations 1-5 are as follows:
<ol id="ol0004" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1. Buffer preparation: 100 mM sodium chloride and 20 mM citric acid were added to the water for injection, and adjusted to the desired pH value in the above formulation with sodium hydroxide.</li>
<li>2. The antibody stock solution (Sichuan Kelun Botai Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Batch No. 1) was dialyzed by ultrafiltration and liquid exchange into the above buffer, and the antibody concentration was adjusted to 20 mg/ml.</li>
<li>3. The prepared sample was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 µm pore size filter under laminar flow, and filled into a vial which was then sealed with a stopper and a cap to obtain the sample.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">The effect of the pH value of the preparation on the stability of the monoclonal antibody was investigated by the DSF method. The results showed that the Tm values of the samples with different pH values were all greater than 65°C, indicating that the pH value in the range of pH 5.6-6.8 does not have a significant effect on the thermal stability of the protein (Table 3). The sample was placed at 40°C for 3 days for accelerated experiment. The SEC-HPLC results showed that the monomer was greater than 99.0% with no significant decrease, no oligomer was detected, and the high polymer was less than 0.20% with no significant increase. The stability of the samples was good (Table 4).

<p id="p0126" num="0126">The antibody preparation of Formulation 6 was enlarged to 10 L with the preparation method as follows:
<ol id="ol0006" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1. Preparation of ultrafiltration buffer: sodium chloride and histidine were added to the water for injection, and the pH value was adjusted to 5.8 with hydrochloric acid to prepare a solution containing 140 mM sodium chloride and 20 mM histidine-histidine hydrochloride.</li>
<li>2. The antibody stock solution (Batch No. 2) was ultrafiltered and liquid exchanged using Millipore ultrafiltration membrane packs by selecting an appropriate number of membrane packs according to the load, using the Thermo Pellicon ultrafiltration system. The protein was dialyzed into the above buffer, the antibody concentration was adjusted to 20 mg/ml, and an appropriate amount of polysorbate 80 was added.</li>
<li>3. The prepared sample was sterilized and filtered under laminar flow conditions. The filtration was performed using 0.22 µm filter of Millipak series (Millipore). If necessary, a pre-filtration membrane Opticap filter can be connected in series before the sterilization filter to increase the filter capacity. In a sterile environment (ultra-clean bench), the sterilization filter was connected to the peristaltic pump with a silica gel tube, followed by a 0.22 µm pore size filter for sterilization and filtration. The filtered sample solutions were collected and filled into vials separately, which were then sealed with stoppers and caps to obtain the samples.</li>

The items investigated were protein concentration, SEC-HPLC, CE-SDS, and IEC-HPLC, and the results are shown in Table 10.

The antibody concentration was stable, the purity remained high, and the stability was good. It can be stored stably for at least 12 months under the temperature of 5°C±3°C.

<p id="p0144" num="0144">First, the experiments of Tm value assay and the stability assay under the condition of 40°C were performed on the antibody preparations of Formulations 1-5. The results showed that the antibody preparations of Formulations 1-5 of the invention have good stability, which also indicates that when the pH value is in the range of 5.6-6.8, the PD-L1 antibody of the invention has a good stability.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">Subsequently, the antibody preparations of Formulations 6-12 were subjected to osmotic pressure monitoring, insoluble particle monitoring, SEC-HPLC detection, IEC-HPLC detection, and CE-SDS detection under the condition of 40°C for 28 days. The results showed that the antibody preparations of Formulations 6-12 of the invention have good stability with no obvious aggregation, which all meet the requirements of medicinal use. In addition, the results showed that the stability of the antibody of the invention is best when the pH is 5.8, and when the buffer pair in the formulation is histidine-histidine hydrochloride, the stability is relatively better than other buffer pairs.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">Therefore, the present inventors conducted further tests and analysis on the antibody preparation of Formulation 6 which is with relative better effects. Specifically, the long-term stability for 12 months at 5°C±3°C and the long-term stability of storage at 5°C for 36 months were analyzed, and the protein concentration, SEC-HPLC, CE-SDS, IEC-HPLC, binding<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> activity, etc. were tested respectively; further, its freeze-thaw stability at -20°C for 48 hours was analyzed, and OD405, SEC-HPLC and IEC-HPLC were tested respectively. The results showed that the antibody preparation of Formulation 6 can be stored stably for at least 12 months at 5°C±3°C, and can still achieve the same product quality as small-scale preparations after scale-up production. After repeated freezing and thawing for 4 cycles, the stability was good, and it can tolerate the severe conditions of the preparation during storage and transportation. In addition, after long-term storage at 5°C for 36 months, the appearance was clear and transparent with no significant changes in protein content, pH, osmolality, CE-SDS reduced and non-reduced, SEC-HPLC, IEC-HPLC and relative binding activity, and the stability is good.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">Furthermore, the inventors tried antibody preparations with high antibody concentrations-Formulations 16-19, and tested the stability of the antibody preparations when the PD-L1 antibody concentration was 60 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml and 120 mg/ml, respectively. The results showed that under the condition of 40°C, the appearance of the antibody preparation of Formulation 16 was clear and transparent liquid with slight opalescence, and the OD405 was stable; under different temperature conditions, the viscosity of the antibody preparations of Formulations 17-19 did not change significantly over time; the antibody preparations of Formulations 18 and 19 had good stability after continuous shaking at 1000 rpm for 2 hours, and can be stored at 5°C and 25°C for 2 months and at 40°C for 13 days. Therefore, in the invention, the antibody preparations with a high concentration of antibody can overcome the problems of stability, viscosity, osmotic pressure and turbidity, which is beneficial for long-term storage of drugs and clinical medication.</p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">In addition, the inventors tested the concentration of NaCl in the antibody preparation-Formulations 13-15 (comparative examples). The results showed that when the NaCl concentration was 0 mM, 35 mM and 70 mM, the osmotic pressure was 199 mOsmol/kg, 232 mOsmol/kg and 258 mOsmol/kg, respectively, which were all lower than that of normal human plasma. It has the risk of hemolysis when administrated intravenously, which does not meet the needs of clinical medication.</p>
