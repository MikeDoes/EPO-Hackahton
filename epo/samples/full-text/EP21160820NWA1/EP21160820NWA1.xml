<p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a schematic of a typical gases delivery system 100, wherein a gases supply 110 supplies gases to a humidification apparatus 150, which supplies heated and humidified gases to a patient 190 via a medical circuit, for example an inspiratory circuit 170, and a patient interface 180. The gases supply 110 and the humidification apparatus 150 may be integrated into a shared housing or may comprise separate housings. In some embodiments, another medical circuit, such as a supply circuit 130, may be used to transport gases from the gases supply 110 to the humidification apparatus 150. In some embodiments, exhaled gases may be transported to the gases supply 110 or elsewhere via another medical circuit, such as an expiratory circuit 160. It is to be understood that some gases delivery systems may not comprise the expiratory circuit 160 and that other variations from the gases delivery system shown may exist.</p>
<heading id="h0009"><u>Medical Circuit</u></heading>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Medical circuits used in hospital settings, such as the expiratory circuit 160, the supply circuit 130, and the inspiratory circuit 170, are often disposable, meant for single patient use and/or a pre-defined maximum duration of use, and thus are disposed of following treatment. Reusable medical circuits have been developed that have a longer lifespan and are able to be cleaned such that they can be reused. Robustness is a key feature of reusable medical circuits, which must undergo many cycles of high level disinfection or sterilisation in between patient uses. As a result, many reusable medical circuits are heavy and cumbersome in use, which may result in patient discomfort.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">A heated reusable medical circuit may comprise a heater wire located in the lumen of the medical circuit. The heater wire may need to be removed prior to cleaning. Following cleaning, the heater wire must then be reinserted into the medical circuit and electrically connected to a connector before the medical circuit can be used for the next patient. This process can be complicated and time consuming.</p>
<heading id="h0010"><u>Medical Tube</u></heading>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">An example medical circuit 205 is shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. The medical circuit 205 comprises a medical tube 220 that comprises a first elongate member 224 and a second elongate member 228. The medical tube 220 is described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2014088430A"><text>International Patent Publication No. WO 2014/088430, published June 12, 2014</text></patcit>, corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="NZ2013000222W"><text>International Patent Application No. PCT/NZ2013/000222, filed December 4, 2013</text></patcit>, and entitled MEDICAL TUBES AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, the first elongate member 224 is hollow, which enables the medical tube 220 to be lightweight. The first elongate member 224 provides thermal insulation, improved humidity performance, and increased flexibility to the medical tube 220. The first elongate member 224 may be at least partially transparent to enable a user to inspect the lumen of the medical tube 220 for blockage or contaminants, or to confirm the presence of moisture. The medical tube 220 is preferably thermally insulating, and as such prevents or reduces heat loss from the gases transported through the lumen of the medical tube 220 to the atmosphere. The first elongate member 224 can be filled with a gas, for example air, to increase insulating performance.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The second elongate member 228 of <figref idref="f0001">Figs. 2 and 3</figref> acts as structural support for the first elongate member 224. The second elongate member 228 can comprise at least one heater wire or sensing wire (not shown), or a combination of heater and sensing wires. Thus, a heater wire, a sensing wire, or a combination of heater and sensing wires can be integrated into the wall of the medical tube 220. This reduces the steps required to prepare the medical tube 220, and thus the medical circuit 205, for cleaning and for use on a patient. The medical tube 220 is a spirally wound structure comprising a flexible, hollow body and an<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> integral support. This provides crush resistance, while leaving the medical tube 220 flexible enough to permit short-radius bends without kinking, occluding, or collapsing. This structure can also provide a smooth internal wall for the medical tube 220, which helps keep the medical tube 220 free from deposits and improves gas flow.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The medical tube 220 may be constructed of materials having properties that enable the medical tube 220 to withstand the rigorous cleaning approaches of autoclaving, pasteurization, high level disinfection, thermal sterilisation, or soaking in chemicals. The materials for the medical tube 220 can be chosen to make the medical tube 220 easier to manufacture, to make the medical tube 220 lighter weight and less cumbersome than other medical tubes, and to form a bond between the medical tube 220 and a connector that can limit or eliminate areas where dirt or potentially harmful substances may become trapped and that can withstand repeated connection and disconnection of the medical circuit 205 to and from a gases delivery system component.</p>
<heading id="h0011"><u>Connector</u></heading>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In gases delivery systems, connectors are often single use or disposable connectors. In some cases, connectors may be made to be cleaned using washer-disinfector machines, pasteurization, or by soaking and/or autoclaving between patients or between uses, such that a circuit comprising such a connector can be classed as a reusable circuit. Reusable circuits may have a defined duration of use and/or may be designed for a specified number of cleaning or disinfection cycles. Such circuits may be desirable for long term solutions.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">A reusable connector may comprise a rigid body with appropriate ports for power adaptors and/or external probes. A connector may have a limited life span following the rigorous cleaning processes it undergoes. In some cases, a connector may have a soft body and a soft taper used to form a connection with a gases delivery system component. In some cases, a connector may have a rigid part suspended within a soft body to provide structural integrity to the body. A medical tube may have a heating component to heat the gases within the tube such that less condensate is produced when using a humidified system. The heating component may be within the lumen of the tube, embedded into the wall of the tube, or<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> outside of the tube. The heating component may need to interact with the connector to form or terminate an electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">It is recognised that some disadvantages may exist in other connectors. For example, connectors with a soft body and a soft connection cuff, which may in some cases comprise a taper, may have highly variable connection, disconnection, and retention forces, which reduce substantially if the connector is wet. The forces for connection and/or disconnection may be elevated when the connection cuff is dry so that sufficient disconnection and/or retention forces are still achieved when the taper is wet. Thus, the connection or disconnection may require high user force input and may be difficult to use when the connector is not wet.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">A heated reusable circuit may have a heating component, such as a heating wire located within the lumen of the circuit. This may need to be removed manually to prepare the circuit for cleaning and may be reinserted into the circuit following the cleaning procedure in preparation for the next use. Such a process may be time consuming, complex, and demanding, thus reducing the overall usability of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">A rigid connector body may include a plurality of rigid components to interact with a power adaptor and/or probes. Variation of the power adaptors and/or probes may make coupling and/or sealing between these and the plurality of rigid components more difficult.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The materials used for a reusable circuit may not be autoclavable and, thus, may become damaged or may degrade during cleaning procedures. As a result, these cleaning procedures may be limited to only lower temperature procedures. In some cases, the medical tube and the connector may separate in use, which may cause the circuit to be discarded. Some reusable circuits have a limited life span and, thus, may have to be replaced more frequently than desired.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">As generally shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the circuit 205 comprises a connector 200 that at least partially overcomes or ameliorates at least one disadvantage of other connectors. The connector 200 is adapted to be coupled with the medical tube 220 that comprises the first elongate member 224 and the second elongate member 228. As discussed, the first elongate<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> member 224 may be a hollow structure that provides insulation and flexibility to the medical tube 220, whereas the second elongate member 228 may provide structural support to the medical tube 220 and, in some embodiments, may comprise a heating and/or sensing component. The heating and/or sensing component may be embedded into the wall of the medical tube 220, which may improve the usability aspects of the medical tube 220 while enabling the circuit 205 to be heated.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">As discussed in greater detail below, the connector 200 may comprise a plurality of rigid components that can be preassembled before the application of an overmold. As a result, the connector 200 may form a connection between the medical tube 220 and a gases delivery system component via a rigid taper while maintaining a soft connector body. The rigid taper may maintain a lower and more consistent connection, disconnection, or retention force regardless of the connector 200 being wet or dry. The rigid taper may also reduce the impact of side loading on the connection, which may cause disconnection between the medical tube 220 and a gases delivery system component. The soft overmold may also provide a soft surface and, in some embodiments, a flexible protrusion or undercut that may form a sealing ring on the inside of power adaptor ports and/or probe ports. This may improve the seal and coupling between the ports and a power adaptor and/or external probes. The soft surface and sealing ring may compensate for any variation that may occur.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Materials may be used that allow the circuit 205 to be autoclaved. Also, the medical tube 220 and the connector 200 may be made from materials with the same or similar thermal properties, for example the same melting point, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of damage to the circuit 205 occurring during manufacturing and cleaning. The circuit 205 may be able to survive at least 50 cleaning cycles with minimal damage, reduction in structural integrity, or alteration to its appearance.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">The connector 200 is shown in <figref idref="f0001">Figs. 2 and 3</figref> connected to the medical tube 220. The connector 200 may be permanently attached at either end of the medical tube 220 and may form a connection with a gases delivery system component. In some embodiments, the medical tube 220 and the connector 200 are reusable. The medical tube 220 comprises the first elongate member 224 and the second elongate member 228. The first elongate member<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 224 may be hollow, which provides an insulating and flexible component to the medical tube 220. The second elongate member 228 may be a more rigid component that provides structural strength to the medical tube 220. In some embodiments, the second elongate member 228 may comprise a heating component and, in some embodiments, a sensing component, such that heating and/or sensing can be embedded into the wall of the medical tube 220. The heating component may be in the form of a plurality of heater wires, for example, two heater wires. The plurality of heater wires may be integrated or embedded into the wall of the medical tube 220.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">The first elongate member 224 and the second elongate member 228 cooperate to reduce the condensate formation and to maintain the humidity of the gases as they are transported within the medical tube 220. The connector 200 may provide an electrical interface between an embedded heating component of the medical tube 220 and a gases delivery system component. This electrical connection may be in the form of, for example, an external lead or an integral electrical connector. In some embodiments, the electrical connection may occur between the connector 200 and the electrical source when the connector 200 is connected with a gases delivery system component. An embedded heating component may substantially improve the usability of the circuit 205 when compared with other reusable circuits because the user may not need to disassemble and/or preassemble the heating component with regards to the tube in preparation for cleaning and/or future use.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The connector 200 may comprise a plurality of rigid components 230 that provide a structural component as well as a rigid taper for the connection of the connector 200 to a gases delivery system component. The plurality of rigid components 230 may be formed from a rigid material, such as, for example, polypropylene. An overmold 240 coats the plurality of rigid components 230 and provides a soft outer surface for the connector 200. Materials used for the overmold 240 may be, but are not limited to, thermoplastic elastomers.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In some embodiments, a region where the plurality of rigid components 230 protrude through the overmold 240 may at least partially define a gripping region 245. The overmold 240 may, in some embodiments, comprise a recessed and/or contoured portion to accentuate the gripping region 245. An embodiment of the gripping region 245 wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> plurality of rigid components 230 do not protrude through the overmold 240, or an embodiment which does not comprise a recessed and/or contoured overmolded portion, or any combination of the above, also falls within the scope of the present disclosure. The gripping region 245 may improve the usability of the connector 200 as it is connected or disconnected from a gases delivery system component.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The overmold 240 may, in some embodiments, form a lip 260 that extends beyond the plurality of rigid components 230, as shown more clearly in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 6</figref>. The lip 260 may comprise a flexible tip and may aid the connection between the connector 200 and a gases delivery system component. The connection may be aided due to a chamfered lead-in, which may improve the alignment of the connector 200 with a gases delivery system component.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">The plurality of rigid components 230 may be arranged in such a way that the plurality of rigid components 230 form an internal wall having a smooth and continuous transition to the internal wall of the medical tube 220. Thus, areas where dirt or potentially harmful substances may become trapped may be limited or eliminated. This may contribute to the medical circuit 205 being able to be satisfactorily cleaned such that it may be reused. Cleaning mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, soaking and autoclaving. A smooth and continuous internal wall spanning between the medical tube 220 and the connector 200 may also prevent an increase in resistance to flow within the circuit 205.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The plurality of rigid components 230 may comprise, for example, a power adaptor port 430, a carrier part 420, and a rigid cuff 410, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="f0002">Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c</figref>. The plurality of rigid components 230 is in no way limited to three rigid components but may, in some embodiments, comprise two or fewer rigid components (inclusive of zero rigid components, for example in an overmolded connector) and, in other embodiments, may comprise four or more rigid components.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The power adaptor port 430 is shown in more detail in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4C</figref> and may facilitate the electrical connection between the connector 200 and an electrical source, thereby providing power to the heating component of the medical tube 220. The electrical source may, in some embodiments, be at least partially associated with a gases delivery<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> system component or it may be a separate apparatus. An external lead may be used to provide the connection between the power adaptor port 430 and the electrical source. Some embodiments may not comprise a heating component within the medical tube 220 and, thus, the connector 200 may not comprise the power adaptor port 430. In other embodiments, multiples of the power adaptor port 430 may be used and associated with the connector 200. In some embodiments, the power adaptor port 430 may be incorporated with another of the plurality of rigid components 230, for example, with the carrier part 420.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">The carrier part 420 is shown in more detail in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4B</figref> and may comprise a probe port 425 that can be configured to receive a sensor probe, for example, a temperature probe or a flow probe. In some embodiments, multiples of the probe port 425 may be associated with the connector 200 while, in other embodiments, the connector 200 may not comprise the probe port 425. In some embodiments, the overmold 240 may provide a soft inner surface to a portion of the probe port 425 and/or the power adaptor port 430. Thus, the probe port 425 and/or the power adaptor port 430 may comprise a soft portion to improve the seal between a probe and/or a power adaptor that may be inserted into the probe port 425 and/or the power adaptor port 430, respectively, by compensating for variations that exist in the contacting surfaces. In some embodiments, the overmold 240 comprises an undercut or flexible protrusion 250, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2 and 3</figref>. The flexible protrusion 250 may comprise an overhanging lip and may be a compressible and sealing protrusion that compensates for surface variations in the probe port 425. The flexible protrusion 250 may be used with the power adaptor port 430 in addition to, or instead of, the probe port 425 and, thus, is not limited to the probe port 425.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The rigid cuff 410 is shown in more detail in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4A</figref> and may be integrated with the medical tube 220 such that the rigid cuff 410 may interact with a port on a gases delivery system component to form a connection between the connector 200 and the gases delivery system component. The rigid cuff 410 may be configured to connect with different medical tapers, for example, but not limited to, a 22 mm tapered cuff. In some embodiments, the rigid cuff 410 may be configured to connect with a female tapered cuff. In other embodiments, the rigid cuff 410 may be configured to connect with a male tapered cuff.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">To remove the connector 200, an axial rotational force may be applied to break the taper or friction seal followed by removing the connector 200. The force required to remove the connector 200 following the breaking of the taper seal may, therefore, be lower than other connectors because such force may not be required to break the taper seal. As a result, it may be less difficult to remove the connector 200 than other connectors. The retention force may be maintained such that it is sufficient for the requirements of the gases delivery system 100. The rigid cuff 410 may also provide a substantially constant connection and/or disconnection force between the connector 200 and a gases delivery system component. This force may not be substantially reduced upon wetting of the connector 200. As a result, usability is improved when compared to other connectors because a substantially lower force is needed to form and/or break a connection while reducing failure rates and without impacting the connection between the connector 200 and a gases delivery system component. The rigid cuff 410 may further reduce the impact of side loading of the connector 200, which in other connectors can cause unwanted and/or accidental disconnection at low forces as a result of the elastic and/or flexible cuffs that may be used. This may improve the overall performance and usability of the connector 200.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The plurality of rigid components 230 may form at least part of a preassembled structure 500, for example, by clipping the plurality of rigid components 230 into place in preparation for overmolding, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 5</figref>. In some embodiments, the preassembled structure 500 may be formed from two or more of the plurality of rigid components 230, for example, two or more of the power adaptor port 430, the carrier part 420, and the rigid cuff 410. Any combination of two or more of the plurality of rigid components 230 may be used. The plurality of rigid components 230 provide a lower cost material to fill the bulk of the connector 200, with the overmold 240 being formed around the preassembled structure 500. The thickness of the overmold 240 may be reduced when compared with other connectors, which may reduce the overall manufacturing time due to a reduced cooling time.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">In some embodiments, the preassembled structure 500 may comprise a clamp (not shown) to aid with the manufacturing of the connector 200. The clamp may be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> coupled with the power adaptor port 430 or, in alternative embodiments, may be coupled with other components of the plurality of rigid components 230, for example, the carrier part 420 or the rigid cuff 410. As an example, the clamp may attach to the second elongate member 228 such that it is held in place in relation to the preassembled structure 500 during manufacturing in preparation for the application of the overmold 240. In some embodiments, the clamp may attach to the first elongate member 224.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The materials of the plurality of rigid components 230 and of the overmold 240 may be chosen such that they bond to form the connector 200. The medical tube 220 may also be made from a thermoplastic elastomer that will bond with the connector 200. The bonding may aid in reducing or eliminating the likelihood of separation of the medical tube 220 and the connector 200 over repeated uses, which separation may create dirt traps that may be difficult to clean. The melting point of the material of the medical tube 220 may be comparable to that of the connector 200, such that the medical tube 220 is less likely to be damaged during manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Material choice may also take into consideration the feel and appearance of the connector 200, such that it is aesthetically pleasing. Similarly, material choices may comprise materials that maintain this appearance throughout the life of the circuit 205. This is an improvement compared with other reusable circuits, which may discolour as the materials degrade over time and/or in response to the cleaning processes. Use of thermoplastic elastomers may also reduce the overall cost of the connector 200. A simplified embodiment may use glue or adhesive to secure the connector 200 and the medical tube 220 together.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">The materials may be chosen such that the overall assembly of the medical tube 220 and the connector 200 can be autoclaved and/or soaked. As a result, the medical circuit 205 may be reused. The medical circuit 205 may last for up to 50 cycles without compromising the condition of the medical tube 220 and the connector 200.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">As discussed below, in some embodiments, a vent may be incorporated into the connector 200 and/or the medical tube 220 to allow gases to move into/out of the first elongate member 224 during autoclaving.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>

<p id="p0064" num="0064">Autoclaving exposes the medical tube 220 to a large range of pressures and temperatures. Some embodiments include the realization that a vent can advantageously allow air or other gases to move between the lumen of the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere during autoclaving to prevent the first elongate member 224 from bursting or collapsing, which would cause the medical tube 220 to become unsightly and diminish the insulating properties of the first elongate member 224. In some embodiments, a vent is inserted directly or indirectly into the first elongate member 224 to prevent the lumen of the first elongate member 224 from bursting or collapsing during autoclaving. The vent allows a gases pathway between the lumen of the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere. Indirect insertion of the vent involves a housing that maintains gaseous communication between the lumen of the first elongate member 224 and the vent.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">The vent can comprise a material with a low surface tension to discourage liquid and/or substances from entering the lumen of the first elongate member 224 during soakage.

In an embodiment, the attachment mechanism 1480 may completely encircle the first elongate member 224 to secure the housing 1460 to the medical tube 220. A piercing member 1470 can be configured to pierce the first elongate member 224, forming the gases pathway 940 between the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere.

The plug 1662 and the receiving portion 1664 each comprises an annular ring, with an opening to allow the gases pathway 940 to be formed between the first elongate member 224 of the medical tube 220 and the atmosphere. The vent 1520 bridges the gases pathway 940 to provide a barrier to liquid and/or substance ingress into the first elongate member 224. As<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> high gases flow rates are enabled through the vent 1520, the diameter of the exposed region of the vent 1520 can be small. The diameter of the exposed region of the vent 1520 can be, for example, 3 mm. This reduces the likelihood of physical damage to the vent 1520, for example in the form of punctures, dirt or substances reacting with or occluding the gases pathway 940, and is aesthetically pleasing. In an alternative embodiment, the diameter of the exposed region of the vent 1520 can be larger to facilitate higher gases flow through the vent 1520. In an embodiment, the cap can be configured to close the gases pathway 940 when the vent 1520 is not in use. In an embodiment, the exposed region of the vent 1520 may comprise a square or rectangular cross-section, or another shape appropriate to the application.</p>

The plug 1662 can be used to apply a force to push the vent 1520 into place in the housing 1560, in the direction as indicated by the arrow. The plug 1662 is therefore received by the receiving portion 1664, and the vent 1520 is firmly placed within the housing 1560. This reduces the vulnerability of the vent 1520 to damage as discussed, and also to accidental repositioning which may compromise the performance of the system. For example, if the vent 1520 moves during cleaning, liquid and/or substances may enter the first elongate member 224, which may discolor or compromise the integrity of the first elongate member 224. In some embodiments, the vent 1520 may be held in place by clips, a latch, friction fit, or adhesives, or may be overmolded into place.</p>

This provides a path through which gases can flow during cleaning, such as during autoclaving. The gases pathway 940 reduces or eliminates the likelihood of the first elongate member 224 being compromised during cleaning. The channel 1668 can be set at any angle from the receiving portion 1664. The size of the channel 1668 can be optimised to provide sufficient gases flow between the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere. The pipe 1666 can be inserted into the first elongate member 224 of the medical tube 220. Thus, the pipe 1666 forms a pneumatic connection between the atmosphere and the first elongate member 224.

Generally nonreactive materials such as polypropylene are suitable for the taper 1905. Preferably, the material selected for the taper 1905 is more rigid than the overmold 240. Rigid materials for the taper 1905 were discovered to improve the connection between the connector 200 and other medical equipment. The connector 200 comprises the probe port 425 and the power adaptor port 430. In the embodiment of <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 19A</figref>, the probe port 425 is within the region of the taper 1905.

<p id="p0101" num="0101"><figref idref="f0013">Fig. 23</figref> shows an embodiment wherein the lumen 830 (obscured) of the first elongate member 224 is open to the atmosphere. This establishes a gases flow path between the lumen 830 and the atmosphere. Thus, the medical tube 220 can be autoclaved without the use of the vent 720 or the vent 1520. In an embodiment, a cap (not shown) can close the opening in the first elongate 224. This enables the medical tube 220 to be soaked, by reducing or eliminating liquid and/or substance ingress into the first elongate member 224.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">In the illustrated embodiment, the opening of the first elongate member 224 comprises a hole 2350. The hole 2350 may be positioned at any point along the first elongate member 224, for example, at one end of the first elongate member 224. The hole 2350 may comprise a small diameter such that it has a low surface tension. As a result, liquid and/or substances are less likely to flow through the hole 2350, but gases can flow to the atmosphere. In some embodiments the shape of the hole 2350 may differ, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, for example, the hole 2350 may be shaped as a slit.</p>

<p id="p0107" num="0107">The vent 720 and the vent 1520 may comprise a material that is chosen for its high heat temperature limits combined with manufacturability. An example of such a material is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The material may be permeable to gases but impermeable to liquids. For example, the material may have a low surface tension that does not allow liquids and/or substances to pass through the pores of the material. The medical tube 220 could be made from any material that is able to withstand autoclaving, high level disinfection, pasteurization, sterilisation or soaking in chemicals. Properties such as flexibility and weight of the medical tube 220 should be considered with material options.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">In some embodiments, the vent 720 and the vent 1520 as discussed may comprise different shapes, sizes, or compositions. The length, depth, and diameter of the vent 720, or the thickness of the vent 1520, may be altered for specific applications. In an embodiment, the length, depth, and diameter of the vent 720, or the thickness of the vent 1520, can be chosen to maintain sufficient gases flow through the vent 720 and the vent 1520 while limiting liquid and/or substance ingress.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">The length with relation to the cross-sectional area of the vent 720, or the thickness with relation to the cross-sectional area of the vent 1520, may have an effect on the<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> liquid and/or substance ingress into the first elongate member 224. For purposes of example only, an increased length or decreased cross-sectional area of the vent 720 may further reduce liquid and/or substance ingress. Similarly, an increased thickness or decreased cross-sectional area of the vent 1520 may reduce liquid and/or substance ingress. A shorter length or increased cross-sectional area of the vent 720 may improve gases flow through the first elongate member 224. A thinner or increased cross-sectional area of the vent 1520 may improve gases flow through the first elongate member 224. Both the length or thickness, and the cross-sectional area, can be altered to optimise the vent 720, 1520 for the application. An optimised ratio between length or thickness, and cross-sectional area allows gases flow while reducing liquid and/or substance ingress through the vent 720, 1520.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">The vent 720, 1520 allows a gases flow between the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere. The vent 720, 1520, or the housing 1060, 1360, 1460, 1560, may be positioned at any point along the first elongate member 224 of the medical tube 220. In some embodiments, the vent 720, 1520 may be located at one end of the medical tube 220. In some embodiments, the vent 720, 1520 may be located at each end of the medical tube 220. In some embodiments, multiple of the vent 720, 1520 may be used.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">In some embodiments, each of the housings 1060, 1360, 1460, 1560 may not comprise the vent 720, 1520. Thus, each of the housings 1060, 1360, 1460, 1560 may be empty. Each of the housings 1060, 1360, 1460, 1560 can be used to form the gases pathway 940 between the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere. Each of the housings 1060, 1360, 1460, 1560 may comprise an opening or hole to pneumatically connect the first elongate member 224 to the atmosphere. As a result, the gases pathway 940 may comprise a hole or slit. A cap may be used to prevent liquid and/or substance ingress.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">Maintaining gaseous communication between the first elongate member 224 and the atmosphere is important for reusable applications, as the medical tube 220 may be required to undergo rigorous cleaning routines such as autoclaving, pasteurizing and/or soaking in a substance. Autoclaving subjects the medical tube 220 to large pressure changes and high temperatures; by way of example only, the temperature during autoclaving could reach 134°C. The materials of the medical tube 220 can be chosen to withstand high<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> temperatures. Gaseous communication between the vent 720, 1520 and the atmosphere allows gases to flow into/out of the first elongate member 224 as the pressure changes. This may prevent the first elongate member 224 from collapsing or bursting during autoclaving.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">In some cases the circuit 205 may be required to withstand soakage for a period of time in a liquid or substance. The vent 720, 1520 can be used to prevent liquid and/or substance ingress into the first elongate member 224. The vent 720, 1520 enables the circuit 205 to withstand soakage for a typical period of time. The time may be in the range of 10 to 30 minutes, or in some cases may be anywhere in the range of 10 to 24 hours. The vent 720, 1520 enables the circuit 205 to be able to withstand different cleaning approaches such that the circuit 205 may be reused. The circuit 205 may be reusable for up to, but not limited to, 50 cycles. In an embodiment, the circuit 205 may be reused for greater than 50 cycles.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In an embodiment, the plurality of heater wires 1015 may be located within the second elongate member 228, such that they are integral to the medical tube 220. As a result, the plurality of heater wires 1015 are not exposed during cleaning. For example, the plurality of heater wires 1015 are not exposed to the liquid and/or substance during soakage of the circuit 205. Thus, the plurality of heater wires 1015 do not need to be removed prior to cleaning, and as such, the user is not required to perform any additional functions to prepare the circuit 205 for cleaning or for use on a patient.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">It is to be understood that use of the medical tube 220 without the plurality of heater wires 1015, or with multiple of the plurality of heater wires 1015 is within the scope of the present disclosure. The second elongate member 228 may comprise a plurality of sensor wires. In some embodiments, the medical tube 220 may comprise any combination of the plurality of heater wires 1015 and the plurality of sensing wires.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">In an embodiment, the vent 720, 1520 can be made from any material that is permeable to gases but impermeable to liquids.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">In an alternative embodiment, the vent 720, 1520 can be made from stainless steel or brass. A stainless steel or brass embodiment of the vent 720, 1520 provides a pathway for the gases to flow during autoclaving, however it may not prevent liquid and/or substances from entering the first elongate member 224 during soaking of the circuit 205.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --></p>
