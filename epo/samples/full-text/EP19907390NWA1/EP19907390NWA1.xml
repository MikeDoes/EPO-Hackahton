<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical field of kitchen utensils, in particular to a pot cover and a cookware.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">A pot cover is a common kitchen appliance, which is mainly used to maintain the temperature of the contents in the pot, and can be used to prevent liquid splashing and steam escaping caused by heating of the contents in the pot. In daily use, when the pot cover covers the pot body to cook food, liquid mixed with food residues will condense on the inner wall of the pot cover. When the pot cover needs to be opened to take out the food in the pot, the pot cover often needs to be placed on the table top, which not only occupies space, but also makes the liquid mixed with food residues easily drip on the table top, thus soiling the table top and increasing the cleaning labor.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">To solve the above problems, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a pot cover and a cookware, which not only reduce the space occupation rate of the kitchen table top, but also prevent the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top, and are more convenient, simple and tidy to use.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The technical schemes adopted by the present invention to solve the above problems are as follows.</p>

<p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, the depth of the groove ranges from 2 mm to 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the width of the groove ranges from 2 mm to 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, a first groove surface, a second groove surface and a third groove surface are formed at the end of the holding part, the first groove surface and the third groove surface are oppositely<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> arranged and respectively connected with the second groove surface, and the third groove surface is convex toward the first groove surface and arranged in an arc shape.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In a second aspect, an embodiment of the present invention provides a cookware comprising: a pot body; and a pot cover as described above, wherein the groove is capable of inserting at any position of an opening edge of the pot body.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, when the groove is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, the cover body abuts against the pot body so that the cover body forms an acute angle with the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, when the groove is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, a projection of a centroid of the pot cover on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the pot body on the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, the opening edge of the pot body is provided with an outer flange, and a wall of the pot body is connected with the outer flange through an arc-shaped connecting edge.</p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to make the object, technical scheme and advantages of the present invention clear, the present invention will be further described in detail with reference to the drawings and examples. It should be understood that the specific embodiments described herein are only used to explain the present invention, and are not used to limit the present invention. It should be noted that, if there is no conflict, the various features in the embodiments of the present invention can be combined with each other, which are within the protection scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the inventor's knowledge, in daily use, when the pot cover covers the pot body to cook food, liquid mixed with food residues will condense on the inner wall of the pot cover. When the pot cover needs to be opened to take out the food in the pot, the pot cover often needs to be placed on the table top, which not only occupies space, but also makes the liquid mixed with food residues easily drip on the table top, thus soiling the table top and increasing the cleaning labor.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Based on this, the present invention provides a pot cover and a cookware. By arranging a groove for insertion at the end of the holding part, the pot cover can be inserted at any position of the opening edge of the pot body and supported above the opening of the pot body, thereby reducing the space occupancy rate on the table top, preventing liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top, and being more convenient, simple and tidy to use.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The embodiments of the present invention will be further explained with reference to the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention provides a pot cover, which comprises a cover body 100 and a handle 200 arranged on the cover body 100, wherein the handle 200 comprises a connecting part 210 for connecting the cover body 100 and a holding part 220 which is convenient to hold, and a groove 300 for inserting is arranged at an end of the holding part 220.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In this embodiment, the connection between the connecting part 210 and the cover 100 can be implemented in various ways. For example, the connecting part 210 and the cover 100 may be integrally formed. For another example, the connecting part 210 can be screwed and connected with the cover 100 by screws or bolts. For yet another example, the connecting part 210 can also be connected with the cover body 100 by buckling or snap-connected. In addition, the connecting part 210 and the holding part 220 can be connected in various ways. For example, the connecting part 210 and the holding part 220 may be integrally formed. For another example, the connecting part 210 and the holding part 220 can be screwed and connected. For yet another example, the connecting part 210 and the holding part 220 can also be snap-connected or connected by buckling.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">In this embodiment, a groove 300 for insertion is provided at the end of the holding part 220. When the pot cover is uncovered from the pot body, the groove 300 is aligned with the opening edge of the pot body and the holding part 220 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body. At this time, the cover body 100 can be supported above the opening of the pot body, thereby reducing the space occupied by the pot cover on the table top. Since the cover body 100 is supported above the opening of the pot body, the liquid mixed with food residues can flow back to the inside of the pot body along the cover body 100, thereby effectively preventing the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top, and being more convenient, simple and tidy to use. In addition, because the groove 300 can be inserted at any position of the opening edge of the pot body, it is convenient for the user to use, so that the user does not need to deliberately find a place to place the pot cover, and the convenience of use is greatly improved. In addition, because the pot cover can be inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, even if the user moves the pot body, the problem of the pot cover falling will not occur, thus avoiding the problem of the pot cover falling and breaking caused by moving the pot body.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, another embodiment of the present invention<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> also provides a pot cover, wherein the projection of the groove 300 on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the cover 100 on the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In this embodiment, the projection of the groove 300 on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the cover 100 on the horizontal plane. When the cover is viewed from top to bottom, the holding part 220 does not extend out of the cover body 100. Therefore, when the groove 300 provided at the end of the holding part 220 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, the cover body 100 extends into the pot body in an inclined manner, so the cover body 100 abuts against the opening edge of the pot body to form two connection points. When the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, a third connection point will be formed. These three connection points are not on the same straight line, so these three connection points form a triangular support configuration with the characteristics of stability, firmness and pressure resistance. Therefore, even if the pot body is shaken, the pot cover can be stably fixed on the pot body, thereby avoiding the problem that the pot cover falls and breaks due to moving or shaking the pot body. In addition, since the cover body 100 extends into the pot body in an inclined manner, the liquid mixed with food residues can flow back into the pot body along the cover body 100, thereby effectively preventing the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a pot cover, wherein the depth of the groove 300 ranges from 2 mm to 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In this embodiment, since the groove 300 needs to be inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, in order to ensure the connection stability between the pot cover and the pot body, the groove 300 needs to have a suitable depth. According to the inventor's research, because the pot cover has a certain weight, if the depth of the groove 300 is too small, the groove 300 can not stably support the pot cover, so it is easy for the pot cover to fall. After several tests by the inventor, when the depth of the groove 300 is not less than 2mm, the opening edge of the pot can be inserted into the groove 300 and the groove 300 can be stably connected with the opening edge, thus ensuring the connection stability between the pot cover and the pot body. In addition, according to the inventor's research, since the cover body 100 extends into the pot body in an inclined manner and abuts against the opening edge, if the depth of the groove 300 is too large, the opening edge cannot be completely inserted into the groove 300, thus reducing the utilization degree of the groove 300. After several tests by the inventor, when the depth of the groove 300 is not more than 50mm, the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> cover 100 can not only abut against the opening edge stably, but also the opening edge can be completely inserted into the groove 300, which improves the utilization degree of the groove 300 on the premise of ensuring the stable connection between the pot cover and the pot body.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a pot cover, wherein the width of the groove 300 ranges from 2 mm to 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In this embodiment, since the groove 300 needs to be inserted at the opening edge of the pot body, and the opening edge is arranged in an arc shape, in order to ensure that the groove 300 can be inserted at the opening edge smoothly, the groove 300 needs to have a suitable width. According to the inventor's research, when the groove 300 is inserted at the edge of the opening, the groove 300 can support the pot cover. Since the pot cover has a certain weight, if the width of the groove 300 is too small, that is, if the strength of the groove 300 for supporting the pot cover is too small, the groove 300 is easily damaged, so that the groove 300 cannot be inserted by the opening edge. After several tests by the inventor, when the width of the groove 300 is not less than 2mm, the groove 300 can have enough strength to support the weight of the pot cover, thus avoiding the damage of the groove 300. In addition, according to the inventor's research, because the opening edge is arranged in an arc shape, if the width of the groove 300 is too large, the groove 300 with too large width will not match the opening edge, thus affecting the effective insertion between the groove 300 and the opening edge. After several tests by the inventor, when the width of the groove 300 is not more than 50mm, there will be no mismatch between the groove 300 and the opening edge of the pot body, thus ensuring the effective insertion between the groove 300 and the opening edge.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, referring to <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a pot cover, in which a first groove surface 310, a second groove surface 320 and a third groove surface 330 are formed in the groove 300 at the end of the holding part 220. The first groove surface 310 and the third groove surface 330 are oppositely arranged and respectively connected with the second groove surface 320, and the third groove surface 330 is convex toward the first groove surface 310 and is arranged in an arc shape.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, when the groove 300 is inserted at the edge of the opening, the surface of the groove 300 near the inner wall of the pot body is the third groove surface 330, and the surface of the groove 300 near the outer wall of the pot body is the first groove surface 310. In this<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> embodiment, the third groove surface 330 is convex toward the first groove surface 310 and arranged in an arc shape, and the arc curvature of the third groove surface 330 matches the arc curvature of the opening edge. Since the third groove surface 330 is matched with the opening edge, when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge, the third groove surface 330 can be attached to the opening edge, thereby increasing the contact area between the groove 300 and the opening edge, ensuring the contact tightness between the groove 300 and the opening edge, and improving the insertion stability between the groove 300 and the opening edge. Even if the user moves or shakes the pot body, the groove 300 will not loose from the opening edge of the pot body, so that the problem that the pot cover falls off due to moving or shaking the pot body can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a cookware, which comprises a pot body 400 and a pot cover in any of the above embodiments, and the groove 300 can be inserted at any position of the opening edge of the pot body 400.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In this embodiment, a groove 300 for insertion is provided at the end of the holding part 220 of the pot cover. When the pot cover is uncovered from the pot body 400, the groove 300 is aligned with the opening edge of the pot body 400 and the holding part 220 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400. At this time, the cover body 100 can be supported above the opening of the pot body 400, thereby reducing the space occupied by the pot cover on the table top. Since the cover body 100 is supported above the opening of the pot body 400, the liquid mixed with food residues can flow back to the inside of the pot body 400 along the cover body 100, thereby effectively preventing the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top, and being more convenient, simple and tidy to use. In addition, because the groove 300 can be inserted at any position of the opening edge of the pot body 400, it is convenient for the user to use, so that the user does not need to deliberately find a place to place the pot cover, and the convenience of use is greatly improved. In addition, because the pot cover can be inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, even if the user moves the pot body 400, the problem of the pot cover falling will not occur, thus avoiding the problem of the pot cover falling and breaking caused by moving the pot body 400.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, referring to <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a cookware, wherein when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the cover body 100 abuts against the pot body 400 so that the cover body<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 100 forms an acute angle with the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In this embodiment, when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the cover body 100 abuts against the pot body 400, and the cover body 100 forms an acute angle with the horizontal plane, that is, the cover body 100 extends into the pot body 400 in an inclined manner. At this time, the cover body 100 abuts against the opening edge of the pot body 400 to form two connection points. In addition, the groove 300 forms a third connection point with the edge of the opening. Because these three connection points are not on the same straight line, these three connection points form stable, strong and pressure-resistant triangular support points. Therefore, even if the pot body 400 is shaken, the pot cover can be stably fixed on the pot body 400, so that the problem that the pot cover falls and breaks due to moving or shaking the pot body 400 can be avoided. In addition, since the cover body 100 extends into the pot body 400 in an inclined manner, the liquid mixed with food residues can flow back into the pot body 400 along the cover body 100, thereby effectively preventing the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a cookware, wherein when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the projection of the centroid of the pot cover on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the pot body 400 on the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In this embodiment, when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the pot cover is supported on the pot body 400 in an inclined manner. At this time, there are three connection points between the pot cover and the pot body 400, which form a triangular area. The projection of the center of mass of the pot cover on the horizontal plane lies in the projection of the pot body 400 on the horizontal plane, that is, the projection of the center of mass of the pot cover on the horizontal plane falls in the triangular area, and these three connection points form three stable support points. Under the weight of the pot cover, the pot cover can be stably supported on the pot body 400. Even if the user moves or shakes the pot body 400, the pot cover will not fall, thus avoiding the problem that the pot cover falls and breaks due to moving or shaking the pot body 400.</p>

<p id="p0039" num="0039">In this embodiment, the wall of the pot body 400 and the outer flange are connected by an arc-shaped connecting edge. When the pot cover is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the cover body 100 of the pot cover will contact with the arc-shaped connecting edge. At this time, the arc-shaped connecting edge can increase the contact area between the cover body 100 and the pot body 400, thereby improving the support stability between the cover and the pot body 400. When the pot body 400 is moved or shaken, the problem that the pot cover falls due to the large displacement of the pot cover can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Furthermore, based on the above embodiments, referring to <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a cookware, wherein when the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the arc-shaped connecting edge, the outer flange and the outer wall of the pot body 400 respectively contact with the inner wall of the groove 300.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">In this embodiment, the arc-shaped connecting edge, the outer flange and the outer wall of the pot body 400 are respectively in contact with the inner wall of the groove 300. Therefore, the groove 300 can be stably inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, so that the holding part 220 of the pot cover can be firmly inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, and the holding part 220 of the pot cover can stably support the pot cover without causing the pot cover to fall. Even if the user moves or shakes the pot body 400, the pot cover will not fall, so that the problem that the pot cover falls and breaks due to moving or shaking the pot body 400 can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In addition, another embodiment of the present invention also provides a cookware, which comprises a pot cover and a pot body 400. The pot cover includes a cover body 100, a connecting part 210 for connecting the cover body 100, and a holding part 220 which is convenient to hold. The end of the holding part 220 is provided with a groove 300 for inserting the opening edge of the pot body 400. The projection of the groove 300 on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the cover 100 on the horizontal plane. A depth range and a width range of the groove 300 are 2mm to 50mm, respectively. A first groove surface 310, a second groove surface 320 and a third groove surface 330 are formed in the groove 300 at the end of the holding portion 220. The first groove surface 310 and the third groove surface 330 are oppositely arranged and respectively connected with the second groove surface 320. The third groove surface 330 protrudes toward the first groove surface 310 and is arranged as an arc surface. The opening edge of the pot body 400 is provided with an outer flange. The wall of the pot body 400 is connected with the outer flange through an arc-shaped connecting<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> edge. When the groove 300 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the cover body 100 abuts against the pot body 400 so that the cover body 100 forms an acute angle with the horizontal plane, and the projection of the centroid of the cover on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the pot body 400 on the horizontal plane. Furthermore, the arc-shaped connecting edge, the outer flange and the outer wall of the pot body 400 are respectively in contact with the inner wall of the groove 300.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In this embodiment, a groove 300 for inserting the pot body 400 is provided at the end of the holding part 220. After the pot cover is uncovered from the pot body 400, the groove 300 is aligned with the opening edge of the pot body 400 and the holding part 220 is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400. At this time, the cover body 100 can be supported above the opening of the pot body 400, so that the space occupied by the cover on the kitchen table can be reduced. Since the cover body 100 is supported above the opening of the pot body 400, the liquid mixed with food residues can flow back to the inside of the pot body 400 along the cover body 100, thereby effectively preventing the liquid mixed with food residues from dripping on the table top, and making use more convenient, simple and tidy. In addition, since the groove 300 can be inserted at any position of the opening edge of the pot body 400, it is convenient for the user to use, so that the user does not need to deliberately find a place to place the pot cover, and the convenience of use is greatly improved. In addition, when the cover is inserted at the opening edge of the pot body 400, the cover body 100 can abut against the pot body 400 so that the cover body 100 forms an acute angle with the horizontal plane, and the projection of the centroid of the cover on the horizontal plane is in the projection of the pot body 400 on the horizontal plane. In addition, the arc-shaped connecting edge, the outer flange and the outer wall of the pot body 400 are respectively contacted with the inner wall of the groove 300, so that even if the user moves or shakes the pot body 400, the pot cover will not fall, thus preventing the pot cover from falling and breaking due to moving or shaking the pot body 400.</p>
