<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a shape of a thin film for heating an object made of various materials in an induction heating type cooktop.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Various types of cooking devices may be used to cook food at home or at restaurants. For example, gas ranges may use gas as fuel to heat food. In some cases, cooking devices may heat a target heating object such as a pot and a cooking vessel using electricity rather than gas.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In some examples, methods for heating a target heating object using electricity may be divided into a resistance heating method and an induction heating method. In the electric resistance heating method, a target heating object may be heated by heat that is generated when a current flows in a metal resistance wire or a non-metallic heating element such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) and transferred to the target heating object (e.g., a cooking vessel) through heat dissipation or heat transfer. In the induction heating method, a target heating object may be heated by an eddy current generated in the target heating object made of a metal material using an electrical field that is generated around a coil when a high frequency power having a predetermined magnitude is applied to the coil.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The induction heating method may be applied to cooktops.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In some cases, a cooktop using an induction heating method may only heat an object made of a magnetic material. That is, when an object made of a nonmagnetic material (for example, heat-resistant glass, porcelain, etc.) is disposed on the cooktop, the cooktop may not heat the nonmagnetic material object.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In some cases, an induction heating device may include a heating plate disposed between a cooktop and a nonmagnetic object to heat the object. Referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP5630495B"><text>5630495 (October 17, 2014</text></patcit>), a method of implementing induction heating by adding the heating plate may have a low heating efficiency due to the heating plate, and a cooking time to heat ingredients contained in the target heating object may be increased.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In some cases, a hybrid cooktop may heat a nonmagnetic object through a radiant heater using an electric resistance heating method, where a magnetic object is heated through a working coil by induction. In some cases, an induction heating method<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is applied. Referring to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008311058A"><text>2008-311058 (December 25, 2008</text></patcit>), a configuration of the hybrid cooktop may have a low output of the radiant heater, and a heating efficiency may be low. A user may feel inconvenience in considering a material of a target heating object when placing the target heating object in the heating area.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In some cases, an all metal cooktop may heat a metal object (e.g., a nonmagnetic metal and a magnetic object. Referring to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6770857B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,770,857 (August 3, 2004</text></patcit>), a configuration of the all metal cooktop is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">However, the all metal cooktop may not heat a nonmagnetic and non-metallic object. In addition, a heating efficiency may be lower than a radiant heater technology, and a material cost may be high.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In some cases, a cooktop may include a thin layer (thin layer or thin film), which is a separate component that can be induction heated. Thus, it may be possible to heat a container made of a magnetic material and thus capable of being induction heated and a container incapable of being directly induction heated using heat conducted from a thin film that is separately induction heated. In some cases, the heating efficiency of a target heating object may be different according to whether the object is made of a magnetic material or a non-magnetic material, and thus, the heating efficiency and usability of the induction heating type cooktop may be different according to the form of a thin film. A thin film, arranged between a target heating object and a working coil, may affect an equivalent circuit seen from the working coil and affect heating efficiency of the target heating object according to the form of the thin film. Thus, the thin film may have influence on the usability of a cooktop that heats a target heating object made of various materials.</p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The present disclosure describes an induction heating type cooktop capable of heating both a magnetic object and a nonmagnetic object.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">The present disclosure also describes an induction heating type cooktop including a thin film that is provided in an optimized shape in which a target heating object can be heated efficiently not just when the target heating object is induction heated but also when the target heating object is heated by heat conduction with an induction heated thin film.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Objects of the present disclosure are not limited thereto, and other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be understood by the following description, and will become more apparent from implementations of the present disclosure.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Furthermore, the objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure can be realized by means disclosed in the accompanying claims or combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one aspect of the subject matter described in this application, an induction heating type cooktop includes a case, an upper plate coupled to a top of the case and configured to support a target heating object, a working coil disposed inside the case and configured to heat the target heating object, a thin film disposed at a top surface of the upper plate or a bottom surface of the upper plate, and an insulator disposed between the bottom surface of the upper plate and the working coil. The thin film includes a plurality of sub-thin films that are arranged about a central portion of the working coil. Each of the plurality of sub-thin films defines a closed loop surrounding the central portion of the working coil. The thin firm further includes a heat conduction member that is arranged in a predetermined pattern and contacts at least one of the plurality of sub-thin films.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Implementations according to this aspect may include one or more of the following features. For example, each of the plurality of sub-thin films may have a ring shape that defines the closed loop. In some examples, the working coil may be configured to generate a magnetic field, where at least a portion of the magnetic field has a magnitude greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold, and the heat conduction member may be disposed at a position corresponding to at least the portion of the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In some implementations, the plurality of sub-thin films may be spaced apart from one another in a radial direction. In some examples, the predetermined pattern of the heat conduction member may include a comb pattern. In some examples, the heat conduction member may have a width that is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold width to thereby limit a magnitude of current leaked from the plurality of sub-thin films to the heat conduction member. In some examples, the magnitude of current in the heat conduction member may be less than or equal to a predetermined threshold current level. In some implementations, the width of the heat conduction member may be in a range from 1 mm to 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In some implementations, the plurality of sub-thin films may be configured to, based on the target heating object made of a non-magnetic material being placed on the upper plate, be heated by induction and provide heat to each of the heat conduction member and the target heating object to thereby heat the target heating object by the plurality of sub-thin films and the heat conduction member. In some implementations, the heat conduction member may be configured to, based on the target heating object<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> made of a magnetic material being placed at the upper plate, pass a magnetic field that is generated by the working coil through the heat conduction member to thereby inductively heat the target heating object.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">In some implementations, the working coil may be configured to induce current based on the thin film and the target heating object forming an equivalent circuit comprising a resistance component and an inductor component. In some examples, a thickness of the thin film may define the resistance component and the inductor component of the equivalent circuit to enable induction heating by the working coil. In some examples, the thickness of the thin film is 6 µm. In some implementations, the thickness of the thin film may be less than a skin depth of the thin film.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">In some implementations, the heat conduction member may include a plurality of radial connections arranged in a circumferential direction and spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction, each of the plurality of radial connections extending in a radial direction between the plurality of sub-thin films. In some examples, each of the plurality of radial connections connects to the plurality of sub-thin films in the radial direction. In some examples, each of the plurality of radial connections may have a linear shape parallel to the radial direction. In some examples, each of the plurality of radial connections has a curved shape extending in the circumferential direction and the radial direction between the plurality of sub-thin films.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In some examples, the plurality of radial connections may include a plurality of first radial connections that extend radially outward from an inner sub-thin film among the plurality of sub-thin films, and a plurality of second radial connections that extend from an outer sub-thin film among the plurality of sub-thin films toward the inner sub-thin film. The plurality of first radial connections and the plurality of second radial connections may be alternately arranged along the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">In some examples, a radial length of each of the plurality of radial connections may be less than or equal to a distance between two of the plurality of sub-thin films.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In some implementations, where a thin film including a plurality of sub-thin films is connected through a heat conduction member disposed in a predetermined pattern, heat may be conducted from the induction-heated sub-thin films to the heat conduction member, and as a magnetic field influences a target heating object through the predetermined pattern, it may be possible to allow induction heating of the target heating object.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">In some implementations, where a plurality of sub-thin films constituting a thin film and forming a closed loop and a heat conduction member are used, it may be possible<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> to expand a heating area by heating a target heating object with heat transferred from the sub-thin films being induction heated.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In some implementations, an induced current may be limited or prevented from flowing to the heat conduction member, and a closed loop of currents may not be formed through the heat conduction member.</p>

<p id="p0031" num="0031">Hereinafter, one or more examples of an induction heating type cooktop will be described.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an induction heating type cooktop.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an induction heating type cooktop 10 may include a case 25, a cover plate 20, working coils WC1 and WC2 (that is, first and second working coils), and thin films TL1 and TL2 (that is, first and second thin films).</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The working coils WC1 and WC2 may be installed in the case 25.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In some implementations, a variety of devices related to driving of a working coil other than the working coils WC1 and WC2 may be installed in the case 25. For example, the devices relating to driving of a working coil may include a power part for providing alternating current power, a rectifying part for rectifying alternating current power from the power part to direct current power, an inverter part for inverting the direct power rectified by the rectifying part to a resonance current through a switching operation, a control part for controlling operations of various devices in the induction heating type cooktop 10, a relay or a semi-conductor switch for turning on and off a working coil, and the like. Regarding this, a detailed description will be herein omitted.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The cover plate 20 may be coupled to a top of the case 25, and may include an upper plate 15 for placing a target object to be heated on the top.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">For example, the cover plate 20 may include the upper plate 15 for placing a target object to be heated, such as a cooking vessel.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In some examples, the upper plate 15 may be made of a glass material (e.g., ceramic glass).</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In some implementations, an input interface may be provided in the upper plate 15 to receive an input from a user and transfer the input to a control part that serves as an input interface. The input interface may be provided at a position other than the upper plate 15.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">The input interface may be configured to allow a user to input a desired heat intensity or an operation time of the induction heating type cooktop 10. The input interface may be implemented in various forms, such as a mechanical button or a touch<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> panel. The input interface may include, for example, a power button, a lock button, a power control button (+, -), a timer control button (+, -), a charging mode button, and the like. The input interface may transfer an input provided by a user to a control part for the input interface, and the control part for the input interface may transfer the input to the aforementioned control part (that is, a control part for an inverter). The aforementioned control part may control operations of various devices (e.g., a working coil) based on an input (that is, a user input) provided from the control part for the input interface, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. In some examples, the control part may be a controller, a processor, or an electric circuit.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">The upper plate 15 may visually display whether the working coils WC1 and WC2 are being driven or not and intensity of heating (that is, thermal power). For example, a fire hole shape may be displayed in the upper plate 15 by an indicator that includes a plurality of light emitting devices (e.g., light emitting diodes (LEDs)) provided in the case 25.</p>

<p id="p0057" num="0057">Since elements disposed in the surroundings of a first working coil WC1 are identical to elements disposed in the surroundings of a second working coil WC2 (the working coil in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), the elements (e.g., the first thin film TL1, the insulator 35, the shield plate 45, the support member 50, and the cooling fan 55) in the surroundings of the first working coil WC1 will be hereinafter described for convenience of explanation.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">The insulator 35 may be provided between a bottom surface of the upper plate 15 and the first working coil WC1.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Specifically, the insulator 35 may be mounted to the cover plate 20, that is, the bottom of the upper plate 15. The first working coil WC1 may be disposed below the insulator 35.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The insulator 35 may block heat, which is generated when the first thin film TL1 or a target heating object HO is heated upon driving of the first working coil WC1, from being transferred to the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">That is, when the first thin film TL1 or the target heating object HO is heated by electromagnetic induction of the first working coil WC1, heat of the first thin film TL1 or the target heating object HO may be transferred to the upper plate 15 and the heat transferred to the upper plate 15 may be transferred to the first working coil WC1, thereby possibly causing damage to the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">By blocking the heat from being transferred to the first working coil WC1, the insulator 35 may prevent damage of the first working coil WC1 caused by the heat and furthermore prevent degradation of heating performance of the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">A spacer, which is not an essential constituent element, may be installed between the first working coil WC1 and the insulator 35.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Specifically, the spacer may be inserted between the first working coil WC1 and the insulator 35, so that the first working coil WC1 and the insulator 35 do not directly contact each other. Accordingly, the spacer may block heat, which is generated when the first thin film TL1 and the target heating object HO are heated upon driving of the first working coil WC1, from being transferred to the first working coil WC1 through the insulator 35.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">That is, since the spacer may share the role of the insulator 35, it may be possible to minimize a thickness of the insulator 35 and accordingly minimize a gap between the target heating object HO and the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">In addition, a plurality of spacers may be provided, and the plurality of spaces may be disposed to be spaced apart from each other in the gap between the first working coil WC1 and the insulator 35.

<p id="p0067" num="0067">That is, the spacer may guide air, introduced into the case 25 by the cooling fan 55, to be properly transferred to the first working coil WC1, thereby improving cooling efficiency of the first working coil WC1.</p>

<p id="p0072" num="0072">As a result, it may be possible to maintain a constant gap between the first working coil WC1 and the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The support member 50 may include, for example, an elastic object (e.g., a spring) to support the shield plate 45 upwardly, but aspects of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. In addition, the support member 50 is not an essential element and thus it may be omitted from the induction heating type cooktop 10.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">The cooling fan 55 may be installed inside the case 25 to cool the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">Specifically, driving of the cooling fan 55 may be controlled by the aforementioned control part and the cooling fan 55 may be installed at a side wall of the case 25. The cooling fan 55 may be installed at a position other than the side wall of the case 25. In an implementation, for convenience of explanation, an example in which the cooling fan 55 is installed at the side wall of the case 25 will be described.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">The cooling fan 55 may suction outdoor air from the outside of the case 25, as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, and transfer the suctioned air to the first working coil WC1. The cooling fan 55 may suction indoor air (e.g., heated air) of the case 25 and discharge the suctioned air to the outside of the case 25.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">In doing so, it may be possible to efficiently cool internal elements (e.g., first working coil WC1) of the case 25.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">In some examples, the outdoor air transferred from the outside of the case 25 to the first working coil WC1 by the cooling fan may be guided to the first working coil WC1 by the spacer. Accordingly, it may be possible to directly and efficiently cool the first working coil WC1, thereby improving endurance of the first working coil WC1. That is, it may be possible to improve the endurance by preventing thermal damage.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">In some examples, the induction heating type cooktop 10 may include one or more of the above-described features and configurations. Hereinafter, features and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> configurations of the aforementioned thin film will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080"><figref idref="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0004">4</figref> are diagrams illustrating a relation between a thickness and a skin depth of a thin film. <figref idref="f0005">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are diagrams illustrating a variation of impedance between a thin film and a target heating object depending on a type of the target heating object.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">The first thin film TL1 and the second thin film TL2 have the same technical features, and the thin film TL1 and TL2 may be coated on the top surface or the bottom surface of the upper plate 15. Hereinafter, for convenience of explanation, the first thin film TL1 coated on the top surface of the upper plate 15 will be described as an example.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">The first thin film TL1 has the following features.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">In some implementations, the first thin film TL1 may include a material having a low relative permeability.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">For example, since the first thin film TL1 has a low relative permeability, the skin depth of the first thin film TL1 may be deep. The skin depth may refer to a depth by which a current can penetrate a material surface, and the relative permeability may be disproportional to the skin depth. Accordingly, the lower the relative permeability of the first thin film TL1, the deeper the skin depth of the first thin film TL1.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">In some examples, the skin depth of the first thin film TL1 may have a value greater than a value corresponding to a thickness of the first thin film TL1. That is, since the first thin film TL1 has a thin thickness (e.g., a thickness of 0.1 µm~1,000 µm) and a skin depth of the first thin film TL1 is greater than the thickness of the first thin film TL1, a magnetic field occurring by the first working coil WC1 may pass through the first thin film TL1 and be then transferred to the target heating object HO. As a result, an eddy current may be induced to the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, when the skin depth of the first thin film TL1 is narrower than the thickness of the first thin film TL1, it is difficult for the magnetic field occurring by the first working coil WC1 to reach the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">In some implementations, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, when the skin depth of the first skin depth TL1 is deeper than the thickness of the first thin film TL1, most of the magnetic field generated by the first working coil WC1 may be transferred to the target heating object HO. That is, since the skin depth of the first thin film TL1 is deeper than the thickness of the first thin film TL1, the magnetic field generated by the first working coil WC1 may pass through the first thin film TL1 and most of the magnetic field energy<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> may be dissipated in the target heating object HO. In doing so, the target heating object HO may be heated primarily.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">Since the first thin film TL1 has a thin thickness as described above, the thin film TL1 may have a resistance value that allows the first thin film TL1 to be heated by the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Specifically, the thickness of the first thin film TL1 may be disproportional to the resistance value of the first thin film TL1 (that is, a sheet resistance value). That is, the thinner the thickness of the first thin film TL1 coated on the upper plate 15, the greater the resistance value (that is, the sheet resistance) of the first thin film TL1. As thinly coated on the upper plate 15, the first thin film TL1 may change in property to a load resistance at which heating may be possible.</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">The first thin film TL1 may have a thickness of, for example, 0.1 µm to 1,000 µm, but not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">The first thin film TL1 having the above-described characteristic is present to heat a nonmagnetic object., and thus, an impedance property between the first thin film TL1 and the target heating object HO may vary according to whether the target heating object HO positioned on the top of the upper plate 15 is a magnetic object or a nonmagnetic object.</p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">One or more examples, where the target heating object is a magnetic object, will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0005">5</figref>, when the first working coil WC1 is driven while a magnetic target heating object HO is positioned on the top of the upper plate 15, a resistance component R1 and an inductor component L1 of the magnetic target heating object HO may form an equivalent circuit to that of a resistance component R2 and an inductor component L2 of the first thin film TL1.</p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">In this case, in the equivalent circuit, an impedance (that is, an impedance of R1 and L1) of the magnetic target heating object HO may be smaller than an impedance (that is, an impedance of R2 and L2) of the first thin film TL1.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">Accordingly, when the aforementioned equivalent circuit is formed, the magnitude of an eddy current I1 applied to the magnetic target heating object HO may be greater than the magnitude of an eddy current I2 applied to the first thin film TL1. More specifically, most of eddy currents may be applied to the target heating object HO, thereby heating the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">That is, when the target heating object HO is a magnetic object, the aforementioned equivalent circuit may be formed and most of eddy currents may be<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> applied to the target heating object HO. Accordingly, the first working coil WC1 may directly heat the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">Since some of eddy currents is applied even to the first thin film TL1, the first thin film TL1 may be heated slightly. Accordingly, the target heating object HO may be indirectly heated to a certain degree by the thin film TL1. However, , a degree to which the target heating object HO is heated indirectly by the first thin film TL1 may not be considered significant, as compared with a degree to which the target heating object HO is heated directly by the first working coil WC1 .</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">One or more examples, where a target heating object is a nonmagnetic object, will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0005">6</figref>, when the working coil WC1 is driven while a nonmagnetic target heating object HO is positioned on the top of the upper plate 15, an impedance may not exist in the nonmagnetic target heating object HO but exists in the first thin film TL1. That is, a resistance component R and an inductor component L may exist only in the first thin film TL1.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">Accordingly, an eddy current I may be applied only to the first thin film TL1 and may not be applied to the nonmagnetic target heating object HO. More specifically, the eddy current I may be applied only to the first thin film TL1, thereby heating the first thin film TL1.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">That is, when the target heating object HO is a nonmagnetic object, the eddy current I may be applied to the first thin film TL1, thereby heating the first thin film TL1. Accordingly, the nonmagnetic target heating object HO may be indirectly heated by the first thin film TL1 that is heated by the first working coil WC1.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">To put it briefly, regardless of whether the target heating object HO is a magnetic object or a nonmagnetic object, the target heating object HO may be heated directly or indirectly by a single heating source which is the first working coil WC1. That is, when the target heating object HO is a magnetic object, the first working coil WC1 may directly heat the target heating object HO, and, when the target heating object HO is a nonmagnetic object, the first thin film TL1 heated by the first working coil WC1 may indirectly heat the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">As described above, the induction heating type cooktop 10 may be capable of heating both a magnetic object and a nonmagnetic object. Thus, the induction heating type cooktop 10 may be capable of heating a target heating object regardless of a position and a type of the target heating object. Accordingly, without determining whether the target heating object is a magnetic object or a nonmagnetic object, a user is allowed to<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> place the target heating object in any heating region on the top plate, and therefore, convenience of use may improve.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">In addition, the induction heating type cooktop 10 may directly or indirectly heat a target heating object using the same heating source, and therefore, a heat plate or a radiant heater is not necessary. Accordingly, it may be possible to increase heating efficiency and cut down a material cost.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">Hereinafter, an induction heating type cooktop will be described.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106"><figref idref="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an induction heating type cooktop. <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating example elements provided inside a case of the induction heating type cooktop shown in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a target heating object positioned at the induction heating type cooktop shown in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">An induction heating type cooktop 2 is identical to the induction heating type cooktop 10 shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, except for some elements and effects. Hence, a difference compared to the induction heating type cooktop 10 will be focused and described.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 8</figref> and <figref idref="f0008">9</figref>, the induction heating type cooktop 2 may be a zone-free cooktop.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">Specifically, the induction heating type cooktop 2 may include a case 25, a cover plate 20, a plurality of thin films TLGs, an insulator 35, a plurality of working coils WCGs, a shield plate 45, a support member 50, a cooling fan, a spacer and a control part.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">Here, the plurality of thin films TLGs and the plurality of WCGs may overlap in a traverse direction and may be disposed to correspond to each other in a one-to-one relationship. The plurality of thin films TLGs and the plurality of thin films WCGs may be in a many-to-many relationship rather than the one-to-one relationship. In some implementations, for example, the plurality of thin films TLGs and the plurality of working coils WCGs may be arranged in a one-to-one relationship.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">For instance, the induction heating type cooktop 2 may be a zone-free cooktop including the plurality of thin films TLGs and the plurality of working coils WCGs, and therefore, it may be possible to heat a single target heating object HO by using some or all of the plurality of working coils WCGs at the same time or by using some or all of the plurality of thin films TLGs at the same time. In some examples, it may be possible to heat the target heating object HO by using both some or all of the plurality of working coils WCG and some or all of the plurality of thin films TLGs.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9</figref>, in a region where the plurality of working coils WCG (see <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>) and the plurality of thin films TLG are present (e.g., a region of the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> upper plate 15), it may be possible to heat target heating objects H01 and H02, regardless of sizes, positions, and types of the target heating objects H01 and H02.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113"><figref idref="f0009">FIG.10</figref> illustrates various forms of a thin film disposed at an upper plate of a cooktop. In some implementations, a thin film may be heated by an induction heating method, and a container (that is, a target heating object HO) disposed at the upper plate 15 is made of a non-magnetic material. Thus, when an induction heated thin film TL is used as the main source of heating to heat the target heating object HO, the thin film TL has a sufficient thickness to secure sufficient inverter control performance. In addition, the heating of the target heating object HO by the induction heated thin film TL is due to heat transfer from the thin film TL. Thus, the wider the area where the thin film TL and the target heating object HO contact each other, the higher efficiency of the target heating object HO. Referring to <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>, heat may be more efficiently conducted from a thin film to a target heating object HO in a thin film shape 1010 having a large area, compared to thin film shapes 1020, 1030, and 1040 each having a smaller area than that of the thin film shape 1010.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In some cases, where the target heating object HO is made of a magnetic material and capable of being directly induction heated, if a thin film TL is in the thin film shape 1010 having a large area, the thin film TL may be at a higher proportion to be induction heated and therefore a temperature increase rate of the thin film TL may increase. When it is detected that a temperature of the thin film TL is heated to or above the limit temperature, the output of the working coil WC may be reduced to maintain stability. If a target heating object HO made of a magnetic material is heated, the temperature of the thin film TL may reach the limit temperature rapidly and hence a process for reducing the output of the working coil WC may be performed. As a result, the heating efficiency of the target heating object HO made of a magnetic material may be undermined. Therefore, in order to improve the heating efficiency of the target heating object HO made of a magnetic material, the thin film TL may have a small area. For example, a small-area thin film shape 1020 in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 10</figref> has a higher efficiency of the object made of a magnetic material than a large-area thin film shape 1020. In the other words, in order to achieve both the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO made of a non-magnetic material and the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO made of a magnetic material, an appropriate width of the thin film TL should be determined. In addition, it is necessary to optimize a heating mechanism for each material of a target heating object HO based on a shape and a pattern design of the thin film TL.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">As an example of a thin film shape for improving heating efficiency, a shape in which a gap is formed between a plurality of thin films TL forming a closed loop (for example, a reference numeral 1030 in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>) may be used, and accordingly, a heating area of a target heating object HO may be reduced. When the plurality of thin films TL forms the closed loop, the plurality of thin films TL may be coupled with a magnetic field from the working coil WC. Therefore, a large coupling force can be achieved using the plurality of thin films TL each having a narrow width and forming the closed loop. However, since the strength of the magnetic field is not uniform, heat of high temperature may occur in some of the plurality of thin films TL. In addition, as the heating area decreases, the size of a resistance component of an equivalent circuit decreases and the size of an inductance component increases. Further, the absence of heat conduction in a portion where a thin film TL is not present undermines the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO made of a non-magnetic material.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">As another example of a thin film shape for improving heating efficiency, a shape (for example, reference numeral 1040 in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>) in which a closed loop of a current induced in a thin film TL does not to include the central portion of the working coil WC may be used. This shape has a weak coupling force with a magnetic field. Thus, in the case where a thin film TL is formed in the aforementioned shape and a target heating object HO is made of a magnetic material, induction heating of the thin film TL may be induction heated to a degree relatively larger, compared to other thin film shapes 1010, 1020, and 1030. Accordingly, the heating efficiency of the target heating object HO made of the magnetic material may be relatively high for a heating area of the target heating object HO. However, the resistance component of the equivalent circuit formed by a thin film TL may have a small size, and the driving frequency of the working coil WC may tend to become relatively very low compared to the driving frequency of the target heating object HO made of a magnetic material. Accordingly, it may be difficult to perform an appropriate output control.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">As such, the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO may be different according to a shape of a thin film TL. The present disclosure proposes an optimal shape of a thin film TL to provide a shape of the thin film TL for increasing the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO made of various materials.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118"><figref idref="f0010">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram of an example of an induction heating type cooktop.</p>

For example, a comb pattern may include a body portion (e.g., the sub-thin film 1320) and a plurality of straight or linear patterns (radial connections or extensions; e.g., the heat conduction member 1330) that are spaced apart from another and extend radially outward from the body portion (e.g., sub-thin film 1320). In some examples, a comb pattern may include a body portion (e.g., the sub-thin film 1520) and a plurality of curved patterns (radial connections or extensions; e.g., the heat conduction member 1530) that are spaced apart from another and extend radially outward from the body portion (e.g., sub-thin film 1520).</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 13</figref>, the heat conduction member 1330 may be arranged in a gap between the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 forming the closed loop. In <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 13</figref>, the heat conduction member 1330 is illustrated as in contact with all the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320. However, the heat conduction member 1330 may contact at least one of the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320, and accordingly, heat<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> may be conducted from the at least one of the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 that are induction heated. In some implementations, the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 and the heat conduction member 1330 may be made of the same material.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">For example, the heat conduction member 1330 may include a plurality of radial connections arranged in a circumferential direction and spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction, where each of the plurality radial connections extends in a radial direction between the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320. In some examples, each of the plurality of radial connections may connect to the plurality of sub-thin films in the radial direction and directly contact at least one of the plurality of sub-thin films. In some cases, each of the plurality of radial connections may have a linear shape parallel to the radial direction. In some cases, each of the plurality of radial connections has a curved shape (e.g., spiral shape) extending in the circumferential direction and the radial direction between the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">In some examples, a radial length of each of the plurality of radial connections may be less than or equal to a distance between the plurality of sub-thin films.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">In some implementations, the heat conduction member 1330 may be arranged at a position where a magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold. In some implementations, the magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 may vary in size in a radial direction.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">The cooktop 1100 may operate the working coil 1150 to induction heat a magnetic object HO placed at the upper plate 1110. In addition, even in the case where a non-magnetic object HO is placed at the upper plate 1110, the cooktop 1100 may indirectly heat the non-magnetic object HO as the thin film 1120 is capable of being induction heated. That is, the thin film 1120 may be made of a predetermined material that can be induction heated, and accordingly, the thin film 1120 may be induction heated in the process of induction heating of a target heating object HO placed at the upper plate 1110. Here, the target heating object HO to be indirectly heated through the induction heated thin film 1120 may be heated faster as the thin film 1120 is larger in area and smaller in thickness. A heating area of the target heating object HO may correspond to the entire area in which a physical configuration constituting the thin film 1120 faces the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">In the thin film 1220 capable of being induction heated, a heat distribution of a portion to be heated may be determined according to a shape of the thin film 1220. For example, when the thin film 1120 has a ring shape that forms a loop, the heat distribution of the thin film 1120 may change in a circumferential direction CD and a radial direction<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> RD of the loop. In particular, in an induction heated thin film 1120 having a ring shape, portions to be heated to the highest temperature and the lowest temperature may exist within a predetermined radius range. The difference in temperature of the thin film 1120 may cause thermal deformation of a single component included in the thin film 1120.</p>
<p id="p0136" num="0136">The reason why the heat distribution of the thin film 1120 is not uniform is that there is a portion in which a magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 is concentrated. In some implementations, the magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 may be concentrated vertically above the central portion of the working coil 1150 in the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">As described above with reference to <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>, if a thin film is formed as a ringshaped single film like the thin film 1010, a non-uniform magnetic field may be generated. In this case, the central portion of the thin film in a radial direction may be induction heated to the highest temperature and other portions adjacent to the inner boundary or the outer boundary may be heated to a relatively low temperature. In some implementations, in order to prevent thermal deformation caused by a difference in heating temperature of the thin film 1220, the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may be disposed at a portion where the magnetic field is less than a predetermined threshold. In some implementations, the heat conduction member 1330 may be disposed at a portion where the magnetic field is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold. As described above, as the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 is disposed at a portion other than the portion where the magnetic field is concentrated, the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may not be rapidly induction heated at a certain portion but heat may be distributed relatively uniformly. In addition, the heat from the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 an 1320 may be conducted to the heat conduction member 1330.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">In some implementations, the plurality of sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may be spaced apart from each other with a gap of a predetermined threshold distance or more in the radial direction. In some implementations, the predetermined threshold distance may be a distance that is set to perform heating adaptively to both a target heating object HO made of a magnetic material and a target heating object HO made of a non-magnetic material. Using the predetermined threshold distance, it is possible to improve the heating efficiency of a target heating object HO made of various materials.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">In some implementations, the predetermined threshold distance may be predetermined as a value of an absolute distance. In some implementations, the predetermined threshold distance may be predetermined as a relative ratio to widths of the sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 in the radial direction. In some implementations, the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> widths of the sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may be 1.3 cm and 3 cm, and a gap between the sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may be 2.2 cm. In some implementations, an inner sub-thin film 1320 among the sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 may include a hollow portion, and the hollow portion may have a diameter of 7 cm. In some implementations, the predetermined threshold distance may be predetermined as the absolute value or relative ratio described above. However, the numerical values in the above-described implementations are merely examples for convenience of explanation, and the numerical values may be changed within an appropriate range according to a specific shape of the thin film 1300.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140"><figref idref="f0012">FIGS. 14A</figref> and <figref idref="f0013">14B</figref> illustrate an example case where that a current induced in a sub-thin film 1122 may be limited or may not flow through a heat conduction member 1124 to another sub-thin film 1122 due to a width of the heat conduction member 1124.</p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">In some implementations, the heat conduction member 1124 may have a width equal to or less than a predetermined threshold width, so that the magnitude of a current flowing in the heat conduction member 1124 by a current induced in the plurality of sub-thin films 1122 becomes equal to or less than a predetermined threshold current level. Even if the heat conduction member 1124 is made of a material through which electricity can flow, the degree to which the current induced in the sub-thin films 1122 is transmitted to the heat conduction member 1124 may vary according to a width of the heat conduction member 1124.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">In some implementations, the thin film 1120 may have a width equal to or less than a predetermined threshold width. The predetermined threshold width may be designed such that a current induced from the sub-thin films 1122 can be limited from flowing to the heat conduction member 1124 or a current equal to or greater than a predetermined magnitude can flow to the heat conduction member 1124. In some examples, a width of the heat conduction member 1124 may be included in a range of 1 mm to 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">Referring to <figref idref="f0012">FIG. 14A</figref>, the thin film 1120 may include sub-thin films 1410 and 1420 and a heat conduction member 1430. In some implementations, an induced current 1412 may flow in the sub-thin films 1410 and 1420 by a magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150. In some implementations, when the heat conduction member 1430 has a width 1434 exceeding a predetermined threshold width, a leakage current 1432 from the induced current 1412 flowing in the sub-thin films 1410 and 1420 may flow to the heat conduction member 1430 and the leakage current 1432 may have a magnitude exceeding a predetermined threshold current level.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">In some cases, when the leakage current 1432 exceeding the predetermined threshold current level flows in the heat conduction member 1430, a closed loop may be formed by the leakage current 1432 flowing in the heat conduction member 1430, and the closed loop may affect the magnetic field passing through the thin film 1120. In some implementations, the closed loop formed by the leakage current 1432 may prevent the magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 from reaching a target heating object HO, thereby undermining the heating efficiency of induction heating of the target heating object HO.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">In <figref idref="f0013">FIG. 14B</figref>, in some implementations, an induced current 1452 may flow in sub-thin films 1450 and 1460 by a magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150. For example, when the heat conduction member 1470 has a width 1474 equal to or less than a predetermined threshold width, the induced current 1452 flowing in the sub-thin films 1450 and 1460 may not flow in the heat conduction member 1470 or only a leakage current 1432 equal to or less than a predetermined threshold current level may flow in the heat conduction member 1470. When the leakage current 1432 does not flow in the heat conduction member 1470 or when the leakage current 1432 equal to or less than the predetermined threshold current level flows in the heat conduction member 1470, a closed loop may not be formed by the leakage current 1432 or may be weakly formed.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">In some examples, a magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 may affect a target heating object HO very slightly. That is, by controlling the magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 not to flow in a portion where the heat conduction member 1430 is present or by controlling only a current equal to or less than the predetermined threshold current level to flow in the aforementioned portion, it is possible to allow the magnetic field generated by the working coil 1150 to reach the target heating object HO by passing through the portion where the sub-thin films 1450 and 1460 are not present. Accordingly, the heating efficiency of induction heating of a magnetic object HO may be relatively higher than that of the example in <figref idref="f0012">FIG. 14A</figref>.</p>

In some implementations, the heat conduction member 1530 may contact the sub-thin films 1510 and 1520 with a width that is set such that an induced current equal to or less than a predetermined threshold current level flows from the sub-thin films 1510 and 1520.</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">In some implementations, the heat conduction member 1530 may be able to heat a target heating object HO with heat conducted from the sub-thin films 1510 and 1520. In order to increase an area to contact the target heating object HO, the heat conduction member 1530 may be arranged in various patterns. For example, in the case where each heat conduction member 1124 has a line shape, the area where the heat conduction member 1530 and a target heating object HO contact each other may be large when the heat conduction member 1530 is arranged obliquely to the sub-thin films 1510 and 1520 as shown in <figref idref="f0014">FIG. 15A</figref>, compared to when the heat conduction member 1330 is disposed to vertically contact the sub-thin films 1310 and 1320 as shown in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 13</figref>. Accordingly, even a portion of the target heating object HO, which is in contact with a region where the sub-thin films 1510 and 1520 are not present, may be heated relatively uniformly.</p>

For example, when the thickness of the thin film 1120 is 1 µm, the resistance component may tend to decrease as the temperature of the thin film 1120<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> increases. As another example, when the thickness of the thin film 1120 is 10 µm, the resistance component may tend to increase as the temperature of the thin film 1120 increases. In some examples, when the thickness of the thin film 1120 is 6 µm, the resistance component may tend to increase and then decrease as the temperature of the thin film 1120 increases.</p>

In some implementations, the memory 1130 may store information on correlations corresponding to various form factors in advance. A microcontroller unit (MCU) 1140 may obtain information representing the form factor of the induction heating type cooktop 1100, select information on a correlation corresponding to the form factor of the induction heating type cooktop 1100, and use the selected information in the process of estimating a temperature.
