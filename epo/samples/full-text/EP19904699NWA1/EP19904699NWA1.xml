<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, and in particular to a compound as an IRAK inhibitor, a method for preparing the same and use of the same in preparing a medicament.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family are intracellular serine-threonine kinases, including: IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1), IRAK2 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-2), IRAK-M (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M) and IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4). A common feature of these four members is the typical N-terminal death domain that mediates the interaction between the MyD88 family adapter and the central kinase domain. In the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, IRAK4 is a key factor downstream of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. When the binding of ligand to a pathogen-specific molecule (e.g., lipopolysaccharide, polypeptide and viral DNA, etc.) recognized by the extracellular portion of TLR, the intracellular portion recruits MyD88 and other factors to form complexes and initiate IRAK1 autophosphorylation, thereby activating downstream serine-threonine kinase TAK1, promoting NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, producing proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and destructive enzymes, and ultimately leading to inflammatory responses that mediate innate immunity. IL-1R is involved in host defense and hematopoiesis and serves as a bridge connecting the innate immunity and acquired immunity. (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Flannery, et. al, Biochem. Pharmacol., 2010, 80 (12):1981-1991</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease prominently characterized by non-suppurative inflammation in joints and joint tissues. RA is mainly manifested by synovitis of joints, which eventually causes damage to various tissues (such as cartilages of joints, ligaments and tendons) and multiple organs. Studies have shown that a variety of immune cells participate and mediate the autoimmune inflammation in RA patients, including T/B lymphocytes,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> macrophages, neutrophils, and others. Meanwhile, a large number of researches have demonstrated the direct association between cytokines and RA, such as interleukins (IL-1/IL-6 and the like) and TNF-α.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Studies have shown that IRAK4 inhibitors can effectively block the production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in LPS or CpG-induced human leukocytes; in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, IRAK4 inhibitors can significantly inhibit the release of TNF, thereby controlling disease progression; in a mouse model of MyD88-dependent inflammatory gout, IRAK4 inhibitors are able to dose-dependently block leukocyte infiltration (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Priscilla N, et. al., J. Exp. Med., 2015, 13 (212):2189-2201</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, it is believed that the excessive activation of IRAK4-dependent TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway is closely related to the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. It has been confirmed in various studies that IRAK4 activation is closely related to the onset and progression of diseases such as tumors, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and allergy (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Chaudhary D, et. al., J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58 (1):96-110</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art to develop a novel kinase cytokine inhibitor to improve the efficacy of treating the related diseases.</p>

<p id="p0408" num="0408">The overnight bacterial cultures were prepared from a stock of the strains. 80 µL of the stock was added to 20 mL of broth. For strains TA98 and TA100, 62.5 µL of ampicillin at a concentration of 0.8% were added per 10 mL of broth #2. The inoculated broth was then incubated on a thermostatic shaker overnight at 37 °C with a rotation speed of 160±10 rpm. The overnight cultures over the target absorbance were stored at 2-8 °C before use. The overnight cultures were used for genotyping and mutation tests.</p>

The Mini-Ames assay was developed from a standard Ames assay. It consumes a relatively smaller amount of test substance while evaluating the mutagenic potential.</p>

No dose-dependent increase in the average number of revertant colonies was observed. The results of the test compounds MY-004-069, MY-004-126-2 and MY-004-127-1 were all <u>negative.</u></p>

<heading id="h0183">Example 48. Inhibition of five major CYP450 enzyme subtypes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes by the compounds according to the present disclosure</heading>
<p id="p0414" num="0414">This study was intended to investigate the inhibitory effect of the test compounds on five major CYP450 enzyme subtypes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes. The mixed human liver microsomes used in this assay were purchased from Corning (USA). The test compounds were co-incubated at 7 concentrations with human liver microsomes and five probe substrates (phenacetin for CYP1a2, diclofenac for CYP2C9, mephenytoin for CYP2C19, dextromethorphan for CYP2D6, midazolam for CYP3A4-M, mixed). See the table below. The reaction was initiated by adding coenzyme NADPH, and terminated by adding acetonitrile containing internal standard. After the proteins were precipitated, the supernatant was centrifuged. The characteristic metabolites in the supernatant (acetaminophen for CYP1A2, 4-hydroxydiclofenac for CYP2C9, 4-hydroxymephenytoin for CYP2C19, dextrorphan for CYP2D6, 1-hydroxymidazolam for CYP3A4-M) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The influence of the test compounds on production of the characteristic metabolites was finally analyzed on the basis of the data obtained. A selective inhibitor (ketoconazole for CYP3A4-M) was used as positive control. All samples were tested in duplicate.
