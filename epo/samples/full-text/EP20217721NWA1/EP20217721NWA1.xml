<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to the technical field of circuit protection, in particular to an automatic disconnection mechanism for switches.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Photovoltaic, short for solar photovoltaic power generation system, is a new type of power generation system that uses the photovoltaic effect of solar cell semiconductor materials to directly convert solar radiation energy into electrical energy, which has two modes of independent operation and grid-connected operation. With the extensive construction of photovoltaic systems, the safety of photovoltaic systems has gradually attracted the attention of the general public and has become a hot issue in the industry in recent years. The photovoltaic DC switch in the photovoltaic system is used in the inverter to control the working status of multiple core components. The reliability of photovoltaic DC switches is not only related to the good operation of the entire photovoltaic system, but also related to the stable development of the photovoltaic industry.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Looking back on the development history of the photovoltaic industry in the past few years, the industry has gradually formulated standards for the use of photovoltaic switches. Major manufacturers have also been studying to enhance the arc extinguishing capability and breaking speed of the switch contacts. However, the knob-type photovoltaic switches currently used in the market are basically manually operated, and the operator needs to manually disconnect the photovoltaic switch after a fault is found, which undoubtedly increases the safety risk of the operator. At the same time, it cannot realize the automatic disconnection when encountering problems, which will easily cause the inverter to burn out and fire, and seriously threaten the safe operation of the photovoltaic power station. Therefore, when a problem occurs in the circuit, how to quickly cut off the DC switch has become an urgent problem for those skilled in the photovoltaic system technology field.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>

<p id="p0039" num="0039">When the invention is specifically implemented: when the switch knob is switched from the OFF position to the ON position for the first time, the mechanism main shaft controls the spring through the shaft sleeve, so that the spring is turned from a releases state to a working state, which enables the energy storage of the spring to be completed when the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> switch is closed for the first time. At the end of the rotation, the rotating shaft sleeve linked with the mechanism main shaft is fixed and locked by the locking mechanism to prevent it from rotating and releasing energy under the huge torque of the spring.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">After the energy storage of the spring is completed, the rotating shaft sleeve is jammed by the locking mechanism and fixed in the energy storage position. At this time, the switch main shaft can still rotate inside the shaft sleeve, that is, the switch can be switched on and off manually. When an overload or short circuit occurs in the inverter, the control center can send a signal to the magnetic flux converter or electromagnet or motor of the DC switch, and the magnetic flux converter or electromagnet immediately produces a hit action and hits the locking mechanism after energized, which enables it to move or rotate away from the rotating shaft sleeve and finally to leave the shaft sleeve. The shaft sleeve lacks the restriction of the locking mechanism and rotates counterclockwise under the drive of the spring force. The stored energy torque of the spring is greater than the operating torque of the switch main shaft, so the switch knob can be driven to switch from the ON position to the OFF position to complete the disconnection operation of the DC switch. After the disconnection operation is completed, the shaft sleeve clamps the mechanism main shaft in the disconnection position.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">When the power supply is restored after troubleshooting, the switch knob should be forcibly turned from the OFF position to the ON position; this process is a process of re-energizing for the switch, and a process of storing energy for the automatic disconnection mechanism. The operator can be reminded that when the knob needs to be turned forcibly, some kind of malfunction must have occurred.</p>
