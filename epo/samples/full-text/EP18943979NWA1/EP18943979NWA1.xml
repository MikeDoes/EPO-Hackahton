<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The mobile terminal industry is developing faster and faster. Accordingly, mobile terminals are no longer limited for making calls; rather, they can be used by people for listening to music, watching videos, browsing web pages and playing games.

<p id="p0003" num="0003">At present, the terminals are mainly charged by means of cables.

<heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In order to comprehensively understand the features and technical contents of the embodiments of the present disclosure, the implementation of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below in conjunction with the drawings. The attached drawings are only for the purpose of reference and explanation, and should not be regarded as limiting the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Wireless charging technology originates from wireless power transmission technology. In the light of different principles of wireless charging, there are mainly three wireless charging methods, i.e., electromagnetic induction (or magnetic coupling) type, radio wave type and electromagnetic resonance type wireless charging. And at present, the prevailing standards for wireless charging include Qi standard, Power Matters Alliance (PMA) standard, Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) standard, and the like. Among them, both the Qi standard and the PMA standard direct at the electromagnetic induction type wireless charging, and the A4WP standard directs at the electromagnetic resonance type wireless charging. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the electromagnetic induction type wireless charging technology is adopted for the device to-be-charged, and energy is transmitted between a wireless charging device (such as a wireless charging dock) and the device to-be-charged through a magnetic field. That is, the battery of the device to-be-charged can be charged without a charging cable between the wireless charging device and the device to-be-charged, which makes the charging more convenient.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Understandably, the device to-be-charged may refer to a terminal, and the terminal may include, but is not limited to, a device that receives and sends communication signals via a wired line (for example, via Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), a digital cable or direct cable connection, and/or via another data connection/network) and/or via a wireless interface (for example, a wireless interface for cellular network, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), digital TV network such as Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) network, satellite network, or Amplitude Modulation-Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) broadcast transmitter, and/or a wireless interface of another communication terminal). Among them, the terminal that communicates via a wireless interface may be referred to as a "wireless communication terminal", a "wireless terminal" and/or a "mobile terminal". The mobile terminal mentioned here includes, but is not limited to, a mobile terminal device such as a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a notebook computer, a palmtop, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a Portable Media Player (PMP) and a navigation device, and may also include a fixed terminal device such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> digital TV and a desktop computer. In addition, the device to-be-charged involved in the embodiments of the present disclosure may also include a portable power source, which can store the received charging energy to provide energy to other electronic devices. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, this is not specifically limited.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The wireless charging method provided by the related technical solutions will be introduced below in conjunction with <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic diagram of the structural composition of a wireless charging system 10 provided by the related technical solutions is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the wireless charging system 10 includes a power supply device 110, a wireless charging device 120 and a device to-be-charged 130. The wireless charging device 120 includes a wireless charging transmission unit 121. The device to-be-charged 130 includes a wireless charging receiver unit 131, a charging management unit 132 and a battery 133. Here, the wireless charging device 120 may be for example a wireless charging dock, and the device to-be-charged 130 may be for example a terminal.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">After the power supply device 110 is connected with the wireless charging device 120, an output voltage and an output current of the power supply device 110 are transmitted to the wireless charging device 120.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The wireless charging device 120 may convert, by the internal wireless charging transmission unit 121, the output voltage and the output current of the power supply device 110 into a wireless charging signal (an electromagnetic signal) for transmission. For example, the wireless charging transmission unit 121 may convert the output current of the power supply device 110 into an alternating current, and convert, by a transmitting coil or a transmitting antenna, the alternating current into a wireless charging signal.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The device to-be-charged 130 may receive, by the wireless charging receiver unit 131, the wireless charging signal transmitted by the wireless charging transmission unit 121, and convert the wireless charging signal into an output voltage and an output current of the wireless charging receiver unit 131. For example, the wireless charging receiver unit 131 may convert, by a receiving coil or a receiving antenna, the wireless charging signal transmitted by the wireless charging transmission unit 121 into an alternating current, and perform operations such as rectification and/or filtering on the alternating current to convert it into the output voltage and output current of the wireless charging unit 131.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In some implementations, before the wireless charging, the wireless charging device 120 may pre-negotiate, with the device to-be-charged 130, a transmit power of the wireless charging transmission unit 121. Assuming that the transmit power negotiated by the wireless charging device 120 and the device to-be-charged 130 is 5W, the output voltage and the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit 131 are generally 5V and 1A, respectively. Assuming that the transmit power negotiated by the wireless charging device 120 and the device to-be-charged 130 is 10.8W, the output voltage and the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit 131 are generally 9V and 1.2A, respectively.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">If the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit 131 is not suitable for being directly applied to the two ends of the battery 133, the charging management unit 132 needs to perform constant<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> voltage and/or constant current control to obtain a charging voltage and/or charging current desired by the battery 133 of the device to-be-charged 130.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The charging management unit 132 may be configured to convert the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit 131, thereby making the output voltage and/or output current of the charging management unit 132 meet the charging voltage and/or charging current desired by the battery 133. In some implementations, the charging management unit 132 may be, for example, a charging integrated circuit (IC), a buck-boost conversion circuit, or a low dropout regulator (LDO).</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The charging management unit 132 is confined to a low power conversion efficiency (which is also referred to as energy conversion efficiency, or circuit conversion efficiency), which causes the unconverted electric energy to be lost in the form of heat. This heat will be gathered inside the device to-be-charged 130. However, both the design space and heat dissipation space of the device to-be-charged 130 are small (for example, the mobile terminal used by the user tends to getting lighter and thinner in terms of the physical size thereof, meanwhile, a large number of electronic components are densely arranged in the mobile terminal to improve the performance of the mobile terminal). This not only increases the design difficulty of the charging management unit 132, but also makes it difficult to remove the heat gathered in the device to-be-charged 130 in time, which in turn causes abnormality of the device to-be-charged 130.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In order to reduce the heat generated by the charging management unit 132, the wireless charging device 120 may output the charging power at a low voltage and high current, for example, a charging power of 5V/4A may be adopted. As a possible implementation, the wireless charging transmission unit 121 may generate the wireless charging signal based on 5V/4A. Accordingly, the wireless charging receiver unit 131 may convert the wireless charging signal into an output voltage/output current of 5V/4A. However, the large charging current of 4A will cause the transmitting coil of the wireless charging transmission unit 121 and the receiving coil of the wireless charging receiver unit 131 to generate a large amount of heat during power transmission. The heat generated during charging would affect the charging speed and the life of the product, and would further reduce the reliability of the product.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">As can be seen, how to reduce the heat generated during wireless charging has become an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In some related technologies, a low charging power is adopted for reducing the heat generated by the coils during the wireless charging process. For example, the wireless charging device 120 outputs a charging power of up to 7.5W to charge the device to-be-charged 130. In this way, the charging speed is slow, and it needs to take a long time to fully charge the device to-be-charged 130.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In some other related technologies, different from adopting a low charging power, the wireless charging device 120 increases the charging power (for example, the charging power is increased from 7.5W to 10W) for wireless charging, in order to increase the charging speed. However, this charging method fails to reduce the charging duration to an expected duration (for example, less than 100 minutes). As described above, in the case where a high power is adopted for the wireless charging, it is inevitable to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> cause the coils or the charging management unit 132 to generate heat. In a wireless charging system adopting the magnetic coupling technology, the distance between the wireless charging device 120 and the device to-be-charged 130 is usually short, and thus the heat generated by the coil of the wireless charging device 120 is transferred to the device to-be-charged 130. As for the device to-be-charged 130 itself, the heat generated by the coil and the charging management unit would be transferred to the battery to a certain extent, and heat is also generated by the battery itself during the charging process. All of them would cause the temperature of the battery to easily exceed the safe charging range. Once the safe range is exceeded due to the heat generated by the coil, the heat generated by the charging management unit and the heat generated by the battery, it has to charge with a low charging power (for example, 7.5W) or suspend the charging, so as to ensure safety of the charging. Therefore, in this related technology, although the maximum charging power of the wireless charging is increased, the duration in which the maximum charging power is adopted is short, that is, high-power wireless charging is enabled only for a short time period, which cannot shorten the charging duration to the expected duration.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">In addition, for reducing the heat generation, some related technologies adopt heat dissipation means, such as graphene or a heat dissipation plate, to dissipate the heat during the charging process. However, such heat dissipation means fail to provide an ideal heat dissipation effect, and instead increase the cost of the product, occupy the internal space of the product, and affect the appearance of the product.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a wireless charging system. The wireless charging system may include a wireless charging signal transmitting device (for example, the above-mentioned wireless charging device) and a wireless charging signal receiving device (for example, the above-mentioned device to-be-charged). Here, wireless communication can be performed between the wireless charging device and the device to-be-charged, and the transmit power of the wireless charging device can be adjusted according to a control instruction sent by the device to-be-charged, thereby making the transmit power of the wireless charging device match a charging voltage and/or charging current currently required by the battery. As a result, the wireless charging power can be increased based on the charging requirements of the device to-be-charged, and the charging speed can be improved accordingly.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In addition, in order to avoid a too large output current of the wireless charging receiver unit, the device to-be-charged can also detect the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit. Accordingly, the wireless charging device can adjust the transmit power according to the control instruction sent by the device to-be-charged, thereby making the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit meet a preset condition.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">By controlling the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit through the wireless charging device, the heat generated by the wireless charging transmission unit (which includes a transmitting coil) and the heat generated by the wireless charging receiver unit (which includes a receiving coil) can be controlled to reduce the heat generated during the charging process. As a result, compared with related technologies, the duration during which the wireless charging is performed with a high power can be prolonged, the charging speed can be increased, and the total charging duration can be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> shortened.</p>

<p id="p0051" num="0051">It should be noted that the power supply device 210 may be a common adapter or a voltage regulation adapter (that is, the adapter itself can adjust the magnitude of the output voltage), or may even be a mobile power supply and the like. In the case where the power supply device 210 is a voltage regulation adapter, the first conversion unit 221 may be omitted from the wireless charging device 220. Here, the first conversion unit 221 is configured for direct current/direct current (DC/DC) voltage conversion, and is mainly configured to adjust the output voltage of the power supply device 101 to a fixed voltage value and provide it to the wireless charging transmission unit 222.</p>

The inverter unit may include a plurality of switches, and the transmit power can be adjusted by controlling the on time (that is, the duty ratio) of the switches. The resonant unit is configured to transmit the electric energy. For example, the resonant unit may include a capacitor and a transmitting coil. By adjusting the operating frequency of the resonance unit, the transmit power of the wireless charging transmission unit 222 can also be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In some implementations, the wireless charging device 220 may be a wireless charging dock, a device with an energy storage function, or the like. In the case where the wireless charging device 220 is a device with an energy storage function, it further includes an energy storage module (for example, a lithium battery 235) which can obtain the electric energy from the external power supply device 210 and store it. In this way, the energy storage module may provide the electric energy to the wireless charging transmission unit 222. Those skilled in the art can understand that the wireless charging device 220 may obtain the electric energy from the external power supply device 210 in a wired or wireless manner. For the wired manner, the wireless charging device is connected for example through a charging interface (for example, a Type-C interface or a USB interface) to the power supply device 210 to obtain the electric energy. For the wireless manner, for example, the wireless charging device 220 may further include a wireless charging receiver unit 231 which can obtain the electric energy wirelessly from a device having a wireless charging function.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The second control unit 223 is configured to control the wireless charging process.

In the case where the battery 235 includes multiple cells, the multiple cells are connected in series. As a result, the charging voltage that the battery 235 can withstand is the sum of the charging voltages that the multiple cells can withstand, which enables the charging speed to be increased and the heat generated during the charging to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">In some implementations, the first charging channel 236 may be a wire. The charging management unit 232 may be provided on the first charging channel 236.</p>

The voltage conversion unit may be a boost conversion circuit, a buck conversion circuit, a buck-boost conversion circuit or the LDO; or it may also be a charge pump circuit, or even a direct charging circuit and the like, which is not specifically limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">The detection unit 234 is configured to detect the voltage value and/or current value on the first charging channel 236. The voltage value and/or current value of the first charging channel 236 may refer to the voltage value and/or current value between the wireless charging receiver unit 231 and the charging management unit 232, that is, the output voltage value and/or output current value of the wireless<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> charging receiver unit 231.

<p id="p0069" num="0069">It should be noted that, "matching the charging voltage value and/or current value required by the battery 235" means that the voltage value and/or current value of the direct current output by the first charging channel 236 is equal to the charging voltage value and/or current value required by the battery 235, or fluctuates within a preset range (for example, the voltage value fluctuates up and down by 100 mV to 200 mV).</p>

<p id="p0071" num="0071">Based on the wireless charging system 20 shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a charging control method. In the method, a battery voltage and a battery current of the battery as well as an output current of the wireless charging receiver unit are first detected. According to the detected battery voltage, the detected battery current and the detected output current, a control instruction is sent to the wireless charging device, where the control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust the transmit power thereof. Based on the response made by the wireless charging device to the control instruction, the wireless charging receiver unit outputs an adjusted output voltage and an adjusted output current, such that the battery is charged according to the adjusted output voltage and the adjusted output current. In this way, during the process of charging the device<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> to-be-charged, not only can the heat generated during charging the device to-be-charged be effectively reduced, but the charging efficiency can also be improved. Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, a charging control method provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. The method is applied to a device to-be-charged. The method may include operations as follows.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">At block S301, a battery voltage and a battery current of a battery of the device to-be-charged, as well as an output current of a wireless charging receiver unit of the device to-be-charged are detected.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">At block S302, a control instruction is sent to a wireless charging device according to the detected battery voltage, the detected battery current and the detected output current, the control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust a transmit power thereof, thereby making the transmit power of the wireless charging device meet a charging power required by the battery, and making the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit in a preset current required range.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">At block S303, an adjusted wireless charging signal sent from the wireless charging device is received by the wireless charging receiver unit, to charge the battery.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">It should be noted that, as for "the response made by the wireless charging device to the control instruction", it may mean that the wireless charging device first determines, according to the control instruction, a target transmit power value for the adjustment, and determines the corresponding target voltage value and target current value based on the target transmit power value, where the product of the target voltage value and the target current value is equal to the target transmit power value. Accordingly, the device to-be-charged receives the adjusted transmit power. In this way, the transmit power of the wireless charging device is enabled to meet the charging power required by the battery of the device to-be-charged, and the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit of the device is enabled to be in the preset current required range.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">In some implementations, the sending, according to the detected battery voltage, the detected battery current and the detected output current, a control instruction to a wireless charging device includes:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>determining, according to the detected battery voltage and the detected battery current, whether a received charging power from the wireless charging device meets the charging power required by the battery;</li>
<li>determining, according to the detected output current, whether the output current is in the preset current required range; and</li>
<li>sending the control instruction to the wireless charging device, upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current is not in the preset current required range.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">Further, in some implementations, the determining, according to the detected battery voltage and the detected battery current, whether the received charging power meets the charging power required by<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the battery includes:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>when the battery is in a constant current charging stage, determining whether the battery current is in a preset constant current range, and determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery upon determining the battery current is not in the preset constant current range; and</li>
<li>when the battery is in a constant voltage charging stage, determining whether the battery voltage is in a preset constant voltage range, and determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery upon determining the battery voltage is not in the preset constant voltage range.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">It should be noted that the charging power required by the battery of the device to-be-charged changes during the process of charging the device to-be-charged. For example, in the constant current (CC) charging stage, the charging power required by the battery increases as the battery voltage increases; and after entering the constant voltage (CV) charging stage, the charging power required by the battery gradually decreases. That is, for different charging stages, the charging current and charging voltage required by the battery are different. Accordingly, the charging power required by the battery is different for different charging stages. Thus, before the wireless charging is performed on the device to-be-charged, the charging current and/or charging voltage required by the battery for each charging stage may be preset, or even a preset range corresponding thereto may be preset (since the voltage value or current value is fluctuating, i.e., it is not a constant value). For example, taking a battery having a single cell and a capacity of 4000mA as an example, in a pre-charging stage, the charging current is 0.03C, and the charging voltage does not exceed 3.6V; in the constant current charging stage, the charging current may be preset to be any value between 1.2C and 1.5C, and the charging voltage is between 3.6V and 4.3V; and in the constant voltage charging stage, the cut-off value of the charging current is 0.01C, and the charging voltage may be preset to be any value between 4.3V and 4.38V In practice, both the preset charging current and/or charging voltage and the respective preset range (such as a preset constant current range and a preset constant voltage range) may be set as required, which is not specifically limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">In addition, the preset current required range indicates a preset range of the output current output by the wireless charging receiver unit of the device to-be-charged. For example, the preset current required range may be 0.95A to 1.05A. In practice, the preset current required range may be set as required, for example, both the maximum preset value (such as 1.05A) and the minimum preset value (such as 0.95A) may be set, or only the maximum preset value (such as 1.05A) may be set. The embodiments of the disclosure do not make specific limitation thereto.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">It should also be noted that the device to-be-charged may also include a detection unit (such as the detection unit 234 shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>), for the detection of the battery voltage and battery current as well as the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit. The detection unit is generally connected in series in the detected circuit, to measure the voltage and the current flowing in the detected circuit. In the embodiments of the disclosure, the detection unit may be resistive (such as a current-sensing resistor), or<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> may be a magnetic device (such as a current transformer, a Rogowski coil or a Hall sensor), or may also be a transistor (such as on-resistance between a drain and a source (RDS(ON)), ratiometric), which is not specifically limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">In some implementations, before the battery voltage and battery current of the battery as well as the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit are detected, the method further includes:
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>receiving a wireless charging signal transmitted by the wireless charging device, and converting, by the wireless charging receiver unit, the wireless charging signal to obtain an output voltage and output current output by the wireless charging receiver unit;</li>
<li>performing, by the charging management unit, voltage converting processing on the output voltage and output current of the wireless charging receiver unit, to obtain a first charging voltage and a first charging current; and</li>
<li>applying the first charging voltage and the first charging current to the battery, thereby charging the battery.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">It should be noted that the wireless charging transmission unit of the wireless charging device includes a transmitting coil, the wireless charging receiver unit of the device to-be-charged includes a receiving coil, and energy is transmitted between the transmitting coil and the receiving coil through electromagnetic induction. In this manner, the wireless charging receiver unit receives and converts the wireless charging signal, and outputs the corresponding output voltage and output current obtained after conversion. Thereafter, the charging management unit performs voltage converting processing on the output voltage and output current to obtain the first charging voltage and the first charging current, and the first charging voltage and the first charging current are applied to the battery of the device to-be-charged for charging.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">However, in the above charging process, in order to reduce the heat generation and improve the charging efficiency, it also detects in real time the battery voltage and battery current corresponding to the battery, as well as the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit. In this way, since wireless communication is enabled between the wireless charging device and the device to-be-charged, the transmit power of the wireless charging device can be adjusted according to the control instruction sent from the device to-be-charged, so as to make the transmit power of the wireless charging device match the charging voltage and/or charging current currently required by the battery. In addition, by adjusting the transmit power, the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit is enabled to meet a preset condition. Moreover, by controlling the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit by means of the wireless charging device, it is possible to control the heat generated by the wireless charging transmission unit (which includes the transmitting coil) and the heat generated by the wireless charging receiver unit (which includes the receiving coil), thereby further reducing the heat generated during the charging process.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">Furthermore, in order to make the received charging power meet the charging power required by the battery, and make the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit in the preset current required range, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, control instructions may be simultaneously<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> sent to the wireless charging device through two control feedback loops (for example, one control feedback loop provided based on the detected battery voltage and battery current, and the other control feedback loop provided based on the detected output voltage and/or output current of the wireless charging receiver unit). Based on the simultaneous control of the two feedback loops, the transmit power of the wireless charging device may be adjusted. According to the adjusted transmit power, not only can the transmit power of the wireless charging device be made to match the charging voltage and/or charging current currently required by the battery, but the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit can also be made to meet the preset condition. Therefore, the heat generated during the charging process is reduced and the charging efficiency is improved. The following will elaborate on the case where the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit is not in the preset current required range.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">Understandably, in order to improve the charging power and the charging speed, the wireless charging device may adjust the transmit power thereof by adjusting operating parameters such as the duty ratio of the at least one switch, the operating frequency and the transmit voltage, thereby making the received charging power meet the charging power required by the battery. In this regard, three ways are included as follows.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">Optionally, the sending the control instruction to the wireless charging device, upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current is not in the preset current required range, includes:<br/>
sending, via wireless communication between the device to-be-charged and the wireless charging device, a first control instruction to the wireless charging device upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery, where the first control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust the duty ratio of the at least one switch so as to adjust the transmit power.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">Optionally, the sending the control instruction to the wireless charging device, upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current is not in the preset current required range, includes:<br/>
sending, via wireless communication between the device to-be-charged and the wireless charging device, a second control instruction to the wireless charging device upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery, where the second control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust the operating frequency so as to adjust the transmit power.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Optionally, the sending the control instruction to the wireless charging device, upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current is not in the preset current required range, includes:<br/>
sending, via wireless communication between the device to-be-charged and the wireless charging device, a third control instruction to the wireless charging device upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery, where the third control instruction is<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust the transmit voltage so as to adjust the transmit power.</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">It should also be noted that, when the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery, generally, a variable-frequency operating mode is first selected for the wireless charging. If the variable-frequency operating mode still cannot make the received charging power meet the charging power required by the battery, at that time, a fixed-frequency operating mode may be selected for the wireless charging.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">Specifically, when the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery, and it is assumed that the wireless charging is performed in the variable-frequency operating mode, at that time, the transmit voltage of the wireless charging device remains unchanged, and the transmit power of the wireless charging device may be adjusted by adjusting the duty ratio of the at least one switch or the operating frequency, thereby adjusting the charging power received by the wireless charging receiver unit. In addition, the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit needs to be in the preset current required range, so as to control the heat generated by the coil. In other words, by adjusting the duty ratio of the at least one switch or the operating frequency, the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit can be adjusted. However, since the ratio of the transmitting coil and the receiving coil is generally set as 1:1, in the way of adjusting the duty ratio of the at least one switch or the operating frequency, the adjusted output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit would not exceed the transmit voltage of the wireless charging device. Thus, if the wireless charging receiver unit requires a higher output voltage, the wireless charging device may work in the fixed-frequency operating mode. As such, the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit can be changed by adjusting the transmit voltage of the wireless charging device, to enable the wireless charging receiver unit to have a higher output voltage. In short, by adjusting the duty ratio of the at least one switch of the wireless charging device or the operating frequency of the wireless charging device, or even adjusting the transmit voltage of the wireless charging device, the charging power received by the wireless charging receiver unit of the device to-be-charged as well as the output voltage and output current of the wireless charging receiver unit can be adjusted. In practice, this may be set as required, and the embodiments of the present disclosure do not make specific limitation thereto.</p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">Understandably, in order to control the heat generated by the coil, the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit may be detected based on the charging process of the device to-be-charged, in addition to the battery voltage and battery current, and it is determined whether the detected output current is in the preset current required range. Specifically, the wireless charging device may also adjust the transmit power by adjusting operating parameters such as the duty ratio of the at least one switch, the operating frequency and the transmit voltage, thereby making the output current in the preset current required range. In this regard, three ways are included as follows.</p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Optionally, the sending the control instruction to the wireless charging device, upon determining the received charging power does not meet the charging power required by the battery and/or the output current is not in the preset current required range, includes:<br/>

<p id="p0100" num="0100">Here it is illustrated by taking the charge pump as an example. The charge pump is composed of multiple switching devices. The amount of heat generated by the current flowing through the switching devices is small, which is almost equivalent to a case where the current directly flows through a wire. By utilizing the charge pump to perform the voltage converting processing on the adjusted output voltage and the adjusted output voltage, not only can an effect of reducing the voltage be achieved, but the amount of the generated heat is low. In addition, it is better for a voltage difference between the adjusted output voltage and the charging voltage obtained after the voltage converting processing to be as small as possible. In the embodiments of the preset application, by adjusting the transmit power of the wireless charging device, the voltage difference between the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit and the battery voltage can be controlled, the heat generated during the process of charging the device to-be-charged is further reduced, and the charging efficiency is further improved.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, a schematic diagram of the structural composition of a device to-be-charged according to the embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the device to-be-charged 230 may further include a second conversion unit 237 and a second charging channel 238. The second charging channel 238 may be a wire. The second conversion unit 237 may be provided on the second charging channel 238, to perform voltage control on the direct current output by the wireless charging receiver unit 231, so as to obtain an output voltage and an output current of the second charging channel 238 to charge the battery 235.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">In some implementations, the second conversion unit 237 may include a step-down circuit, and is configured to output constant current and/or constant voltage electric energy.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">In the case where the second charging channel 238 is used to charge the battery 235, the wireless charging transmission unit 222 may adopt a constant transmit power. After the wireless charging signal is received by the wireless charging receiver unit 231, it is processed by the second conversion unit 237 to obtain a voltage and a current meeting the charging demands of the battery 235, for output to and charging the battery 235. Those skilled in the art can understand that, in some implementations, the constant transmit power does not necessarily mean that the transmit power remains unchanged, and it rather can vary within a certain range. For example, the transmit power may be 7.5W, and it may fluctuate up and down by 0.5W.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">In this embodiment, the first control circuit 233 is further configured to compare the detected output voltage value of a rectifier circuit of the wireless charging receiver unit 231 and a preset target value (for example, it may be set as the value of a maximum voltage to be output by the rectifier circuit),<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> to determine an error value, and send to the second control unit 223 the error value in the form of a data packet.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">In some implementations, in the case where the battery 235 is charged through the second charging channel 238, the wireless charging device 220 and the device to-be-charged 230 may perform the wireless charging according to the Qi standard. Therefore, by means of signal modulation, a data signal including the error value may be coupled to the coil of the wireless charging receiver unit 231, so as to be sent to the coil of the wireless charging transmission unit 222, and then transmitted to the second control unit 223. The second control unit 223 may adjust, according to the error information of the data packet, the transmission parameters of the wireless charging transmission unit 121 such as the operating frequency of the transmitting coil of the wireless charging transmission unit 121.</p>

The second control unit 223 determines a difference value based on the current value of the transmitting coil currently adopted and the error information of the data packet, and sets a new operating frequency based on the difference value to adjust the transmit power of the wireless charging transmission unit 222.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, a charging mode in which the battery 235 is charged through the first charging channel 236 is referred to as a first charging mode, and a charging mode in which the battery 235 is charged through the second charging channel 238 is referred to as a second charging mode. The wireless charging device 220 and the device to-be-charged 230 may determine, based on a handshake, whether the first charging mode or the second charging mode is to be adopted for charging the battery 235.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, on the side of the wireless charging device 220, the maximum transmit power of the wireless charging transmission unit 220 may be a first transmit power value when the device to-be-charged 230 is charged in the first charging mode, and the maximum transmit power of the wireless charging transmission unit 222 may be a second transmit power value when the device to-be-charged 230 is charged in the second charging mode. The first transmit power value is greater than the second transmit power value, and thus the charging speed of charging the device to-be-charged in the first charging mode is greater than that in the second charging mode.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">On the side of the device to-be-charged 230, the first control unit 233 controls, according to the charging mode, the switching between the first charging channel 236 and the second charging channel 238.

<p id="p0113" num="0113">It should be noted that, in conjunction with the device to-be-charged shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the device to-be-charged 230 includes the first charging channel 236 and the second charging channel 238, and the charging speed of the first charging channel 236 is faster than that of the second charging channel 238. In this way, by detecting the battery temperature of the battery 235, the first control unit 233 may control, based on the battery temperature, the switching between the first charging channel 236 and the second charging channel 238. In addition, the device to-be-charged 230 and the wireless charging device 220 may also determine, based on the handshake, whether the first charging channel 236 or the second charging channel 238 is to be adopted for charging the battery 235. When the handshake is successfully established, the first control unit 233 may control the first charging channel 236 to work; otherwise, the first control unit 233 may control the second charging channel 238 to work.

<p id="p0117" num="0117">Here, the second wireless charging mode may be referred to as a common wireless charging mode, for example, it may be a conventional wireless charging mode based on the QI standard, the PMA standard, or the A4WP standard. The first wireless charging mode may be a fast wireless charging mode. The common wireless charging mode may refer to a wireless charging mode in which the transmit power of the wireless charging device 220 is small (which is usually less than 15W, and the commonly used transmit power is 5W or 10W). In the common wireless charging mode, several hours would be taken to fully charge a large-capacity battery (for example, a battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh). In the fast wireless charging mode, the transmit power of the wireless charging device 220 is relatively large (which is usually greater than or equal to 15W). Compared with the common wireless charging mode, the wireless charging device 220 takes a shorter time to fully charge the battery with the same capacity in the fast wireless charging mode, that is, the charging speed thereof is faster.</p>

<p id="p0121" num="0121">It should be noted that the battery 235 provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure may include one cell, or may include N cells connected in series (N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2). Taking N=2 as an example, the battery 235 may include a first cell and a second cell which are connected in series with each other. Here, it is illustrated by taking a case where the charging power is equal to 20W and the charging voltage of each cell is equal to 5V as an example. In order to meet the charging voltage requirements of the two series-connected cells, the output voltage/output current of the first charging channel 236 needs to be maintained at 10V/2A. In this way, the wireless charging transmission unit 222 generates the wireless charging signal based on 10V/2A. Accordingly, the wireless charging receiver unit 231 converts the wireless charging signal into an output voltage/output current of 10V/2A. Since the current is reduced from 4A to 2A, the heat generated during the power transmission would be reduced accordingly. Therefore, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, multiple cells connected in series may also be used to reduce the heat generated by the wireless charging transmission unit 222 and the wireless charging receiver unit 231.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">In the above description, it is illustrated by taking N=2 as an example. In practice, the value of N may be 3 or a positive integer greater than 3. The more the cells connected in series with each other, the smaller the amount of heat generated by the electric energy passing through the wireless charging transmission unit 222 and the wireless charging receiver unit 231.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">It should also be noted that, the embodiments of the present disclosure further modify the structure of the battery of the device to-be-charged 230, in order to ensure the charging speed and further alleviate the heating problem of the device to-be-charged 230. In particular, multiple cells connected in series are introduced. Compared with the solution adopting a single cell, the charging current required by the multiple cells is 1/N of the charging current required by the single cell (N is the number of the cells connected in series in the device to-be-charged 230) for achieving a same charging speed. In other words, under the premise of ensuring the same charging speed, the embodiments of the present disclosure can greatly reduce the magnitude of the charging current, thereby further reducing the heat generated by the device to-be-charged 230 during the charging process.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the multiple cells may have the same or similar specifications and parameters, which is convenient for unified management and is beneficial to improve the overall performance and service life of the multiple cells.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">During the charging process, the electric energy output by the first charging channel or the second charging channel is used to charge the multiple series-connected cells. In a process of supplying<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> power, the voltage of the multiple cells may be reduced by the charging management unit or the second conversion unit, and then is used to power the device to-be-charged 230. Alternatively, one of the multiple cells may also be used to power the device to-be-charged.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">In order to keep the power of the multiple cells balanced, power balance processing may be performed on the multiple cells by a balance circuit, during the charging and discharging processes. The balance circuit may be implemented in many ways. For example, a load may be connected at both ends of a cell to consume the power of the cell, so as to keep the power of the cell consistent with the power of other cells, and thus make the voltages of the various cells consistent with each other. Alternatively, it is possible to charge a cell having a low power with a cell having a high power until the voltages of the various cells are the same.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">As mentioned above, the charging process of the battery may include one or more of a trickle charging stage, a constant current charging phase and a constant voltage charging phase. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to further increase the charging speed, the charging duration of the constant voltage charging stage may be shortened or the constant voltage charging stage may be eliminated, by controlling the charging voltage and the charging current. In this way, the charging speed can be greatly improved compared with the charging processes in the related art.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">In some implementations, a preset limit voltage Vn higher than a preset cut-off voltage of the battery may be provided, and a plurality of preset charging currents [I1, I2, I3,..., In] may be provided, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and I1≥I2≥I3......≥In. It should be understood that the preset limit voltage Vn is related to the battery system and materials used therefor. In some implementations, if the preset cut-off voltage (which may be the standard cut-off voltage of the battery) is V0, Vn may be set as V0+ΔV For example, ΔV may be a value between 0.05V and 0.1V. The values of the charging current I1, I2,..., In are also related to the battery system and the materials used therefor.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">After the battery system is determined, the battery capacity is determined. According to the relationship among the charging voltage, charging current, charging duration and battery capacity, the preset charging current at different phases may be determined when the charging voltage is equal to the preset limit voltage Vn. In some implementations, the difference between two adjacent preset charging currents I1, I2, I3,..., In may be set as ΔI, for example, ΔI may be a value between 100mA and 1A.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">In some implementations, no matter whether the first charging channel or the second charging channel mentioned above is used, once the battery voltage reaches the preset cut-off voltage, constant current charging is performed on the battery with the preset charging current I1 until the battery voltage reaches the preset limit voltage Vn. After the constant current charging performed on the battery with the preset charging current I1 is stopped, the voltage would drop at some extent. Therefore, the constant current charging is further performed on the battery with the preset charging current I2, until the battery voltage reaches the preset limit voltage Vn. The above operations are repeated until the preset limit voltage Vn is reached by performing the constant current charging with the last preset charging current In, and then the charging may be stopped. In this way, by setting the preset limit voltage Vn and the preset charging current at various phrases, the constant voltage charging stage in the related technology can be<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> eliminated, and the charging duration can be greatly shortened.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">In other implementations, no matter whether the first charging channel or the second charging channel mentioned above is used, once the battery voltage reaches the preset cut-off voltage, constant current charging is performed on the battery with the preset charging current I1 until the battery voltage reaches the preset limit voltage Vn. Thereafter, the constant current charging is further performed on the battery with the preset charging current I2, until the battery voltage reaches the preset limit voltage Vn. The above operations are repeated until the preset limit voltage Vn is reached by performing the constant current charging with the last preset charging current In. Then, constant voltage charging is performed by using Vn as the charging voltage, for a preset time period or until the charging current decreases to a preset value. Thereafter, the charging may be stopped. Different from the elimination of the constant voltage charging stage in the above implementation, in this implementation, the duration in which the constant voltage charging is performed is reduced due to the increased charging cut-off voltage; and therefore, the charging duration can also be greatly shortened compared with the related technology.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">In the case where the battery has multiple cells, in the above method, it is necessary to monitor whether the voltage of each cell reaches the preset cut-off voltage and the preset limit voltage. Once the voltage of any cell reaches the preset cut-off voltage or the preset limit voltage, the charging current used for the constant current charging is changed. Alternatively, in some implementations, a charging circuit of the cell(s) whose voltage has reached the preset cut-off voltage or the preset limit voltage may be disconnected, and other cells whose voltage has not reached the preset cut-off voltage or the preset limit voltage may continue to be charged. That is, each cell may be independently charged according to the above-mentioned charging process.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">The foregoing embodiments provide a charging control method, which is applied to a device to-be-charged.

Then, an adjusted wireless charging signal sent from the wireless charging device is received by the wireless charging receiver unit to charge the battery. The control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust a transmit power thereof, thereby making the transmit power of the wireless charging device meet a charging power required by the battery, and making the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit in a preset current required range.

According to the detected battery voltage and current as well as the detected output current, a control instruction is sent to a wireless charging device. The control instruction is configured to instruct the wireless charging device to adjust a transmit power thereof, thereby making the transmit power of the wireless charging device meet a charging power required by the battery of the device to-be-charged, and making the output current of the wireless charging receiver unit in a preset current required range. As such, not only can the charging efficiency of charging the device to-be-charged be improved, but a voltage difference between the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver unit and the battery voltage can be effectively controlled. Accordingly, an adjusted wireless charging signal sent from the wireless charging device is received by the wireless charging receiver unit to charge the battery. In this way, during the process of charging the device to-be-charged, not only can the heat generated by charging the device to-be-charged be reduced, but the charging efficiency can be improved at the same time.</p>
