<p id="p0148" num="0148">After the light emitting elements LD are aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel, the first electrode REL1 may function as a first driving electrode for driving the light emitting elements LD.</p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">The first electrode REL1 may be electrically connected to the first terminal SE or the second terminal DE of the driving transistor T1 (T) through the first contact hole CH1 of the passivation layer PSV. For the sake of explanation, although the first electrode REL1 is illustrated as being connected to the second terminal DE of the driving transistor T1 (T), the first electrode REL1 may be connected to the first terminal SE of the driving transistor T1 (T) in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">Because the first electrode REL1 is connected to<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> the second terminal DE of the driving transistor T1 (T), a signal applied to the second terminal DE of the driving transistor T1 (T) may be transmitted to the first electrode REL1.

<p id="p0151" num="0151">The first insulating layer INS1 may be provided on the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE. The first insulating layer INS1 may be formed of any one insulating layer of an inorganic insulating layer including inorganic material or an organic insulating layer including organic material.</p>
<p id="p0152" num="0152">The first insulating layer INS1 may prevent exposure of one area of the first electrode REL1, e.g., an area other than an area coupled (or brought into contact) with the first end portion EP1 of each of the light emitting elements LD, to the outside, thus protecting the first electrode REL1. Furthermore, the first insulating layer INS1 may cover one area of the contact electrode CNE, e.g., an area other than an area coupled with the second electrode REL2, and prevent exposure of the one area of the contact electrode CNE to the outside, thus protecting the contact electrode CNE.</p>
<p id="p0153" num="0153">The second electrode REL2 may extend in the second direction DR2 and overlap with the contact electrode CNE, in a<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> plan view. The second electrode REL2 may be electrically and/or physically connected with the contact electrode CNE that is not covered with the first insulating layer INS1, in a sectional view. Hence, the voltage of the second driving power supply VSS that is applied to the connection line CNL may be transmitted to the second electrode REL2 through the contact electrode CNE.</p>
<p id="p0154" num="0154">The second electrode REL2 may overlap with the light emitting elements LD and be coupled (or brought into contact) with any one end portion of the opposite end portions EP1 and EP2 of each light emitting element LD, e.g., the second end portion EP. Hence, the voltage of the second driving power supply VSS applied to the second electrode REL2 may be transmitted to the second end portion EP2 of each of the light emitting elements LD. As described above, because the second electrode REL2 applies a predetermined voltage, e.g., the second driving voltage VSS, to the second end portion EP2 of each of the light emitting elements LD, the second electrode REL2 along with the first electrode REL1 may function as a driving electrode for driving the light emitting elements LD.</p>
<p id="p0155" num="0155">The second electrode REL2 may be formed of transparent conductive material to allow light emitted from each of the light emitting elements LD and reflected by the first electrode REL1 in the frontal direction of the display device (or in the direction in which an image is displayed) to<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> travel in the frontal direction without loss. The transparent conductive material may include, e.g., ITO, IZO, ITZO, etc., but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

Furthermore, the second electrode REL2 may overlap with the partition wall PW. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the second electrode REL2 may be provided and/or formed over the first electrode REL1 with the light emitting elements LD interposed therebetween. In other words, the first electrode REL1 may be provided and/or formed on the first end portion EP1 (or 'lower end portion') of each of the light emitting elements LD, and the second electrode REL2 may be provided and/or formed on the second end portion EP2 (or 'upper end portion') of each of the light emitting elements LD.</p>

Each of the light emitting elements LD may further include an insulating film 14 which encloses a portion of the outer circumferential surface (or the surface) of the light emitting pattern 10 having a core-shell structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --></p>
<p id="p0161" num="0161">Each of the light emitting elements LD may have a first end portion EP1 and a second end portion EP2 each of which has a shape protruding outward in the longitudinal direction (L). In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 may be disposed on the first end portion EP1 of each light emitting element LD, and the electrode layer 15 or the second conductive semiconductor layer 13 may be disposed on the second end portion EP2 thereof. The present disclosure is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the electrode layer 15 or the second conductive semiconductor layer 13 may be disposed on the first end portion EP1 of each light emitting element LD, and the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 may be disposed on the second end portion EP2 thereof. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, at least a portion of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11, e.g., a lower surface thereof, may be directly coupled (or come into contact) with the first electrode REL1. At least a portion of the electrode layer 15, e.g., an upper surface thereof, may be directly coupled (or come into contact) with the second electrode REL2.</p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">The first end portion EP1 and the second end portion EP2 of each of the light emitting elements LD may have different shapes protruding outward in the longitudinal direction (L) of each light emitting element LD. Particularly, each of the light emitting elements LD may have a shape corresponding to<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> the shape of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, opposite end portions of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 may have shapes protruding in the longitudinal direction (L) of each light emitting element LD. Disposed at an upper position with respect to the longitudinal direction (L), a first end portion of the opposite end portions of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 may have a conical shape the width of which is reduced upward to form one apex, and a second end portion thereof disposed at a lower position with respect to the longitudinal direction (L) may have a square pillar shape with a constant width.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">As described above, in the case where the first end portion of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 has a hexagonal pyramid shape, and the second end portion thereof has a square pillar shape, one end portion of the opposite end portions EP1 and EP2 of each of the light emitting elements LD may have a hexagonal pyramid shape, and the other end portion thereof may have a square pillar shape. For example, the first end portion EP1 of each of the light emitting elements LD may have a square pillar shape, and the second end portion EP2 may have a conical shape, which forms an apex with respect to the longitudinal direction (L). In an embodiment, the first end portion EP1 of each light emitting element LD may have a polygonal pillar shape the width of which is reduced downward<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> with respect to the longitudinal direction (L) of each light emitting element LD or, on the contrary, may have a polygonal pillar shape the width of which is reduced upward.

<p id="p0164" num="0164">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the electrode layer 15 that is not covered with the insulating film 14 may be provided on the second end portion EP2 of each of the light emitting elements LD. In other words, at least a portion of the electrode layer 15 of each of the light emitting elements LD may not be covered with the insulating film 14. The electrode layer 15 may be directly coupled (or brought into contact) with the second electrode REL2 rather than being covered with the insulating film 14, and thus be electrically and/or physically coupled with the second electrode REL2. During a process of forming the display element layer DPL of each sub-pixel, at least a portion of the electrode layer 15 may be exposed by removing a portion of the insulating film 14. Detailed description of this process will be provided below with reference to <figref idref="f0021">FIG. 20i</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0165" num="0165">A portion of the light emitting element LD, other than the lower surface of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 that is directly coupled (or brought into direct contact) with the first electrode REL1 and at least a portion<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> of the electrode layer 15 that is directly coupled (or brought into contact) with the second electrode REL2, may be covered with the insulating film 14. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the active layer 13 in each light emitting element LD may be covered with the insulating film 14.</p>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, in each light emitting element LD, the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 disposed at a lower position with respect to the longitudinal direction (L) is directly coupled (or brought into direct contact) with the first electrode REL1, and the electrode layer 15 disposed thereover is directly coupled (or brought into direct contact) with the second electrode REL2. Hence, each of the light emitting elements LD in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel may be disposed between the first electrode REL1 and the second electrode REL2 with respect to the longitudinal direction L. In other words, each of the light emitting elements LD may be aligned (or disposed) in the vertical direction in a sectional view, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">A predetermined voltage may be applied to the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 disposed on the first end portion EP1 of each of the light emitting elements LD through the first electrode REL1. A predetermined voltage may be applied to the electrode layer 15 disposed on the second end<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> portion EP2 through the second electrode REL2. Hence, each of the light emitting elements LD may emit light by coupling of electron-hole pairs in the active layer 12 of each of the light emitting elements LD.</p>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, because the active layer 12 of each of the light emitting elements LD may be provided in the form of enclosing the outer circumferential surface (or the surface) of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11, light may be emitted from each of the light emitting elements LD along an area in which the active layer 12 is disposed. In other words, each of the light emitting elements LD may emit light from all areas in which the active layer 12 is disposed. Consequently, because each of the light emitting elements LD includes the light emitting pattern 10 having a core-shell including the active layer 12 that encloses the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 disposed in a central area, a surface area with which light is emitted from each light emitting element LD may be further increased.</p>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">In the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel, the light emitting elements LD may be aligned (or disposed) in the opening OPN of the partition wall PW and be enclosed by the partition wall PW. Hence, each of the light emitting elements LD may be enclosed by the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE that are provided on the partition wall PW. Light<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> emitted from each of the light emitting elements LD may be reflected by the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE and travel in the frontal direction of the display device (or the direction in which an image is displayed).</p>
<p id="p0170" num="0170">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, because each of the light emitting elements LD is aligned (or disposed) in the longitudinal direction (L) of the light emitting element LD (or in the vertical direction in a sectional view), and the active layer 12 is provided in the form of enclosing the outer circumferential surface of the first conductive semiconductor layer 11, each light emitting element LD may emit light from all areas in which the active layer 12 is disposed. Particularly, because each of the light emitting elements LD is aligned (or disposed) in the longitudinal direction (L) (or in the vertical direction in a sectional view), the active layer 12 of each light emitting element LD may be enclosed by a structure for absorbing light and, e.g., may be spaced apart from the pixel circuit layer PCL by a predetermined distance and enclosed by the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE. Hence, light emitted from the active layer 12 of each of the light emitting elements LD may travel in the frontal direction of the display device by the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE rather than traveling to the pixel circuit layer PCL.</p>
<p id="p0171" num="0171">Light emitted from the active layer 12 disposed on<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> the second end portion EP2 of each light emitting element LD may directly travel in the frontal direction of the display device after passing through the second electrode REL2.

<p id="p0172" num="0172">In the case where the light emitting elements LD are aligned (or disposed) in one direction (or a horizontal direction in a sectional view) intersecting with the longitudinal direction (L) of the light emitting element LD, at least one area of the active layer 12 that is provided in the form of enclosing the first conductive semiconductor layer 11 may closely face the pixel circuit layer PCL. In this case, some of the light emitted from the active layer 12 may travel to the pixel circuit layer PCL, e.g., the passivation layer PSV, and be absorbed by the passivation layer PSV and not be reflected by the first electrode REL1 and the contact electrode CNE, thus not traveling in the frontal direction of the display device. Hence, in the case where the light emitting elements LD are aligned (or disposed) in one direction (or in the horizontal direction in a sectional view) intersecting with the<!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --> longitudinal direction (L) of the light emitting element LD, the efficiency of light emitted from each light emitting element LD may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">Given this, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the light emitting elements LD are aligned in the longitudinal direction (L) (or the vertical direction in a sectional view) so that light emitted from each light emitting element LD can travel in the frontal direction of the display device without loss, whereby the light output efficiency of each light emitting element LD can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">The above-mentioned light emitting elements LD may be stably fixed by the intermediate layer CTL in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel.

For example, the first color conversion layer CCL1 may be disposed over the first sub-pixel SP1, and the second color conversion layer CCL2 may be disposed over the second sub-pixel SP2. Consequently, the display device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure may display a full-color image.</p>
<p id="p0307" num="0307">In an embodiment, the first color conversion layer CCL1 may be disposed on one surface of the second substrate SUB2 to face the first sub-pixel SP1 and include first color conversion particles which convert the color of light emitted from light emitting elements LD provided on the corresponding sub-pixel to a first color of light. For example, in the case<!-- EPO <DP n="113"> --> where the first sub-pixel SP1 is a red sub-pixel, the first color conversion layer CCL1 may include red quantum dots QDr which convert blue light emitted from the light emitting elements LD aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of the first sub-pixel SP1 to red light. If blue light is drawn into the first color conversion layer CCL1 including the red quantum dots QDr, the first color conversion layer CCL1 may absorb the blue light, shift the wavelength of the light by an energy transition, and emit red light having a wavelength in a range from approximately 620 nm to approximately 680 nm.</p>
<p id="p0308" num="0308">In an embodiment, the second color conversion layer CCL2 may be disposed on one surface of the second substrate SUB2 to face the second sub-pixel SP2 and include second color conversion particles which convert the color of light emitted from light emitting elements LD provided on the corresponding sub-pixel to a second color of light. For example, in the case where the second sub-pixel SP2 is a green sub-pixel, the second color conversion layer CCL2 may include green quantum dots QDg which convert blue light emitted from the light emitting elements LD aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of the second sub-pixel SP2 to green light. If blue light is drawn into the second color conversion layer CCL2 including the green quantum dots QDg, the second color conversion layer CCL2 may absorb the blue light, shift the wavelength of the light by an energy transition, and emit green light having a<!-- EPO <DP n="114"> --> wavelength in a range from approximately 500 nm to approximately 560 nm.</p>
<p id="p0309" num="0309">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the red quantum dots QDr and the green quantum dots QDg may be selected from among a group IIIV compound, a group IV-VI compound, a group IV element, a group IV compound, and a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p0310" num="0310">The light scattering layer LSL may be disposed on one surface of the second substrate SUB2 to face the third sub-pixel SP3. For example, the light scattering layer LSL may be disposed between the third sub-pixel SP3 and the third color filter CF3.</p>
<p id="p0311" num="0311">The first color filter CF1 may be disposed between the first color conversion layer CCL1 and the second substrate SUB2 and include color filter material which allows the first color of light converted by the first color conversion layer CCL1 to selectively pass therethrough. For example, the first color filter CF1 may be a red color filter.</p>
<p id="p0312" num="0312">The second color filter CF2 may be disposed between the second color conversion layer CCL2 and the second substrate SUB2 and include color filter material which allows the second color of light converted by the second color conversion layer CCL2 to selectively pass therethrough. For example, the second color filter CF2 may be a green color filter.</p>
<p id="p0313" num="0313">The third color filter CF3 may be disposed on one surface of the second substrate SUB2 to face the third sub-pixel<!-- EPO <DP n="115"> --> SP3 and include color filter material which allows the light emitted from the light emitting elements LD aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of the corresponding sub-pixel to selectively pass therethrough. For example, the third color filter CF3 may be a blue color filter.</p>
<p id="p0314" num="0314">A black matrix BM may be disposed each between the first color filter CF1 and the second color filter CF2 and between the second color filter CF2 and the third color filter CF3. For example, the black matrix BM may be disposed on the second substrate SUB2 to overlap with the bank BNK on the first substrate SUB1.</p>
<p id="p0315" num="0315">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, when blue light having a comparatively short wavelength in a visible ray area is incident on each of the red and green quantum dots QDr and QDg, the absorption coefficient of the red and green quantum dots QDr and QDg may be increased. Thereby, eventually, the efficiency of light emitted from each of the first sub-pixel SP1 and the second sub-pixel SP2 may be enhanced, and satisfactory color reproducibility may be secured.</p>
<p id="p0316" num="0316">Furthermore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, each pixel PXL using the light emitting elements LD for emitting the same color light and the display device including the same may be easily manufactured. Because the color conversion layer CCL is disposed on at least some sub-pixels, a display device including full-color pixels PXL may<!-- EPO <DP n="116"> --> be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p0317" num="0317">Each of the light emitting elements LD aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel may have opposite end portions EP1 and EP2 each having a shape protruding in the longitudinal direction (L). Each of the light emitting elements LD may be aligned (or disposed) in the longitudinal direction (L) (e.g., in the vertical direction in a sectional view) in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel. Particularly, each of the light emitting elements LD may be aligned (or disposed) between the first electrode REL1 and the second electrode REL2 in the opening OPN included in the partition wall PW. In each of the light emitting elements LD, the first end portion EP1 disposed at a lower side in the longitudinal direction (L) may be brought into direct contact with (or directly coupled with) the first electrode REL1, and the second end portion EP2 disposed at an upper side may be brought into direct contact with (or directly coupled with) the second electrode REL2.</p>
<p id="p0318" num="0318">The light emitting elements LD may be stably fixed in the longitudinal direction (L) (or in the vertical direction in a sectional view) by the intermediate layer CTL provided in the form of being charged into the opening OPN of the partition wall PW. In the case where each of the light emitting elements LD is aligned in the vertical direction, light emitted from all areas in which the active layer 12 of each light emitting<!-- EPO <DP n="117"> --> element LD is disposed may travel in the frontal direction of the display device (e.g., in the direction in which an image is displayed) without being absorbed or lost by a light absorption structure such as the pixel circuit layer PCL. Hence, the light output efficiency of the light emitting elements LD aligned (or disposed) in the emission area EMA of each sub-pixel may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p0319" num="0319">While various embodiments have been described above, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.</p>
