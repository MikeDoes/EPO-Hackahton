<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a method of manufacturing a fabricated object.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, an additive manufacturing method for obtaining a three-dimensional object by layering and fabricating metal is used as a method of manufacturing various metal products. For example, in an additive manufacturing method using a powder bed method, a three-dimensional object is formed by repeatedly welding and solidifying through irradiating a metal powder layered with an energy beam such as a light beam or an electron beam (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1).</p>

<p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6405028B"><text>6405028</text></patcit></p>
<heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading>
<heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, in the additive manufacturing method using a powder bed method, after the fabricated object is formed, metal powder remaining in the hollow internal space of the fabricated object is discharged to the outside of the fabricated object from an opening portion that communicates with the internal space. When leaving the opening portion is disadvantageous during use of the fabricated object, it is necessary to close the opening portion after the metal powder is discharged.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in a case where the opening portion is closed by, for example, TIG welding, it is difficult to ensure the flatness of the surface on which the closed portion faces the internal space. In addition, in a case where the opening portion is closed by TIG welding, heat input to the fabricated object tends to be relatively large, and there is a concern that the heat causes deformation of the fabricated object.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, it is also conceivable that the opening portion is closed by the fabricating method using, for example, a laser metal deposition (LMD) method, by suppressing the amount of heat input and blowing the welded metal powder to the wall that forms the opening portion. In this case, it is possible to expect suppression of deformation due to heat compared to TIG welding, but in the additive manufacturing method using an LMD method, it is difficult to close the bottomless opening portion.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above-described circumstances, it is an object of at least one embodiment of the present disclosure to facilitate closing the opening portion that communicates with the hollow internal space.</p>

<p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an overall configuration of a three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1, which is an apparatus capable of applying a method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 is an apparatus for manufacturing a three-dimensional fabricated object 15 by performing additive manufacturing involving irradiating a metal powder, which is a raw material powder laid down in layers, with an energy beam. The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 can perform additive manufacturing using a powder bed method.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> can, for example, form a rotor blade or a stator vane of a turbine, such as a gas turbine or a steam turbine, or a component, such as a combustor basket, a transition piece, or a nozzle of a combustor.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a storage portion 31 for a metal powder 30. The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a powder bed forming portion 5 including a base plate 2 on which a powder bed 8 is formed by the metal powder 30 supplied from the storage portion 31. The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a light beam irradiation unit 9 capable of irradiating the powder bed 8 with a light beam 9a.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The base plate 2 is a base on which the fabricated object 15 is fabricated. The base plate 2 is arranged such that base plate 2 can be lifted and lowered by a drive cylinder 2a on the inside of a substantially tube-shaped cylinder 4 having a central axis along the vertical direction. The powder bed 8 formed on the base plate 2 is newly formed by powder being spread out on the top layer side of the base plate 2 each time the base plate 2 descends in each cycle as indicated by the arrow a in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> during the fabricating work.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a case where the three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 is irradiated with the light beam as an energy beam, but other forms of an energy beam such as an electron beam may be used.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1 illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a powder laying unit 10 for laying down the metal powder 30 on the base plate 2 to form the powder bed 8. The powder laying unit 10 forms the layered powder bed 8 having a substantially uniform thickness across the entire upper surface of the base plate 2 by supplying the metal powder 30 from the storage portion 31 to the top surface side of the base plate 2 and flattening the surface. The powder bed 8 formed in each cycle is selectively solidified by being irradiated with the light beam 9a from the light beam irradiation unit 9. In the following cycle, the metal powder 30 is laid down again on the top layer side by the powder laying unit 10, and a new powder bed 8 is formed such that a plurality of powder beds 8 are stacked in layers.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> In additive manufacturing using the powder bed method, in a case where a hollow internal space 17 exists inside the fabricated object 15, the metal powder 30 remains in the internal space 17 after the fabricated object 15 is formed. Thus, discharging the remaining metal powder (a residual powder 33) to the outside of the fabricated object 15 is preferable.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">For example, in a case where an opening portion 20 that communicates with the internal space 17 is required when the fabricated object 15 is in use, and a necessary opening portion 21 to be described below is provided in the fabricated object 15, the residual powder 33 can be discharged from the necessary opening portion 21.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In a case where the necessary opening portion 21 is not provided in the fabricated object 15, or in a case where the discharge of the residual powder 33 is insufficient from the necessary opening portion 21 even when the necessary opening portion 21 is provided, a powder removal opening portion 23, which is the opening portion 20 that communicates with the internal space 17, is required for discharging the residual powder 33. The residual powder can be discharged when the powder removal opening portion 23 has a diameter of, for example, approximately 2 mm or greater.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">However, when leaving the powder removal opening portion 23 is disadvantageous during use of the fabricated object 15, it is necessary to close the powder removal opening portion 23 after discharging the residual powder 33. For example, in a case where the internal space 17 that communicates with the powder removal opening portion 23 is a fluid flow path formed within the fabricated object 15 as described below and fluid leakage from anywhere other than the flow path inlet and the flow path outlet of the flow path is not allowed, the powder removal opening portion 23 must be closed. Note that the flow path inlet and the flow path outlet correspond to the necessary opening portion 21.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, from the viewpoint of suppressing pressure loss of the fluid that flows through the flow path, it is desirable that recesses and projections that have a non-negligible effect on pressure loss at the portion where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed (the closed portion) are not generated facing the flow path. In other words, there is a case where it is desirable that the surface on the internal space 17 side of the closed portion is smooth. However, it is often difficult to process the surface on the internal space 17 side of the closed portion retroactively, and it may be difficult to observe the surface on the internal space 17 side of the closed portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">However, in a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed by, for example, tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, it is difficult to ensure the flatness of the surface on the internal space 17 side of the closed portion. In addition, in a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed by TIG welding, heat input to the fabricated object 15 tends to be relatively large, leading to a concern that this heat deforms the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Further, for example, when the fabricated object 15 is a component used in a high-temperature environment, from the viewpoint of heat resistance, it is desirable that the material used to close the powder removal opening portion 23 is the same material as that of the fabricated object 15. In other words, there is a case where it is desirable that the material used to close the powder removal opening portion 23 be the same material as that of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">However, in a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed by TIG welding, for example, the material of a filler such as a wire used for closing the powder removal opening portion 23 is limited, and thus, it may not be possible to close the opening portion with the same material as that of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">It is also conceivable to close the powder removal opening portion 23 by suppressing the amount of heat input and blowing the welded metal powder toward the wall surface that forms the powder removal opening portion 23, by using the fabricating method using a laser metal deposition (LMD) method, for example. In this case, it is possible to expect suppression of deformation due to heat compared to TIG welding. However, in an additive manufacturing method using an LMD method, it is difficult to close the bottomless opening portion.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Therefore, in the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the above-described inconvenience is eliminated by manufacturing the fabricated object as described below.

<p id="p0038" num="0038">In the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>, for example, the fabricated object 15 including the internal space 17 and the powder removal opening portion 23 that communicates with the internal space 17 is formed. The residual powder 33 remains in the internal space 17 of the fabricated object 15 obtained by executing the step S1 of forming the fabricated object.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The shape of the powder removal opening portion 23 when the powder removal opening portion 23 is viewed from the outside to the inside of the fabricated object 15 may be, for example, circular may be elliptical, or may be rectangular. In other words, the shape of the powder removal opening portion 23 when the powder removal opening portion 23 is viewed from the outside to the inside of the fabricated object 15 is not particularly limited.</p>

<heading id="h0014">Step S3 of Forming Plug</heading>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The step S3 of forming the plug is a step of forming a plug 40 by layering the metal powder 30 using, for example, the above-described three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1. In addition, the plug 40 is a plug used for closing the powder removal opening portion 23 as described below.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In the step S3 of forming the plug, the plug 40 may be formed under the same conditions as the fabrication conditions of the fabricated object 15. The fabrication conditions include, for example, the output of the light beam 9a, the scanning speed of the light beam 9a, the beam diameter of the light beam 9a, the layering thickness of the metal powder 30 when the metal powder 30 is uniformly laid down on the powder bed 8 (descending amount of the base plate 2), and the like.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Further, in the step S3 of forming the plug, the plug 40 may be formed at the same time as the formation of the fabricated object 15. In other words, in the step S3 of forming the plug, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, by forming the plug 40 within the same powder bed 8 as the powder bed 8 in which the fabricated object 15 is formed, the plug 40 may be formed at the same time as the fabricated object 15.</p>

<heading id="h0017">Step S9 of Welding Plug to Fabricated Object</heading>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object is a step of welding the plug 40 mounted in the opening portion 20 (powder removal opening portion 23) to the fabricated object 15.</p>

<p id="p0056" num="0056">In the step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object, the plug 40 and the fabricated object 15 are integrated by welding the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15 by using an energy beam such as the light beam 90. The portion where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed in this manner is referred to as a closed portion 19. In addition, in <figref idref="f0004">FIGS. 3D</figref> and <figref idref="f0006">4D</figref>, a position corresponding to the inner circumferential wall of the powder removal opening portion 23 is indicated by a two-dot chain line.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">As described above, according to the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments, by welding the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15, it is possible to easily close the powder removal opening portion 23 that communicates with the hollow internal space 17.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">In other words, by welding the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15, a surface (inner surface) 19a on the internal space 17 side of the closed portion 19 can be smoothed compared to that in a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed by, for example, TIG welding.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, by welding the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15, it is possible to suppress heat input to the fabricated object 15 and suppress deformation of the fabricated object 15 due to heat compared to a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is closed by, for example, TIG welding.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">When the material of the plug 40 is the same material as that of the fabricated object 15 and the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 is welded to the fabricated object 15 by using an energy beam such as a light beam, it is possible to close the powder removal opening portion 23 with the same material as that of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">As described above, according to the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments, the step S5 of discharging residual powder is provided, and thus, it is possible to discharge the residual<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> powder 33 that remains in the internal space 17 from the powder removal opening portion 23 to the outside of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">As described above, according to the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments, since the step S3 of forming the plug is provided, it is possible to form the plug 40 with the metal powder 30 used to form the fabricated object 15. Accordingly, the material of the plug 40 and the material of the fabricated object 15 can be the same. Therefore, similar to a case where the fabricated object 15 is, for example, a component used in a high-temperature environment, the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to the above-described some embodiments is appropriate when it is desirable for the material used to close the powder removal opening portion 23 be the same material as that of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As described above, in the step S3 of forming the plug, the plug 40 may be formed under the same conditions as the fabrication conditions of the fabricated object 15. Accordingly, quality, for example, surface roughness, dimensional tolerances, and the like can be kept equivalent between the fabricated object 15 and the plug 40.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">In a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is not formed in the fabricated object 15 in the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, it is necessary to form the powder removal opening portion 23 in the fabricated object 15 after the fabricated object 15 is formed. In this case, when the fabricated object 15 is a high-strength member such as a heat-resistant alloy, it is difficult to form the powder removal opening portion 23 in the fabricated object 15 by using a typical cutting process. Therefore, when the fabricated object 15 is a high-strength member such as a heat-resistant alloy, the powder removal opening portion 23 is formed in the fabricated object 15 by, for example, electric discharge machining.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">However, the electrode for processing wears down during electric discharge machining, and thus it is necessary to appropriately modify the position of the electrode during processing. Therefore, in a case of forming the powder removal opening portion 23 in the fabricated object 15 by electric discharge machining, it is conceivable that the dimensions of the powder removal opening portion 23 differ slightly depending on the time of execution of the electric discharge machining. Therefore, there is a concern that inconveniences may occur in which the plug 40 cannot be mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23, or a gap between the powder removal<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> opening portion 23 and the plug 40 is so large that it is difficult to retain the plug 40 in the powder removal opening portion 23 and the plug 40 easily falls out.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">In addition, even in a case of forming the fabricated object 15 and the plug 40 by additive manufacturing, for example, there is a concern that the focal point of the light beam shifts over time, and when the formation timing of the fabricated object 15 and the plug 40 differ in units of a week or a month, for example, there is also a concern that the dimensional accuracy of the powder removal opening portion 23 and the dimensional accuracy of the plug 40 are not kept equivalent.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">According to the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments, in the step S3 of forming the plug, by forming the plug 40 at the same time as the fabricated object 15, that is, by forming the plug 40 in the same powder bed 8 as the powder bed 8 on which the fabricated object 15 is formed, the quality of surface roughness, dimensional tolerances, and the like can be kept equivalent between the fabricated object 15 and the plug 40. Therefore, the dimensional accuracy of the powder removal opening portion 23 and the dimensional accuracy of the plug 40 can be equivalent. Accordingly, even when a process for adjusting dimensions is not performed after the formation of the powder removal opening portion 23 or the plug 40, inconveniences are unlikely to occur in which the plug 40 cannot be mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 because the dimensional accuracy of the powder removal opening portion 23 and the dimensional accuracy of the plug 40 are not equivalent, or a gap between the powder removal opening portion 23 and the plug 40 is so large that it is difficult to retain the plug 40 in the powder removal opening portion 23 and the plug 40 easily falls off.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">In addition, the dimensions and tolerance of the powder removal opening portion 23 and the dimensions and tolerance of the plug 40 are appropriately determined by the operator taking into consideration design requirements, materials, fitting methods (such as the presence or absence of tapers described below), or the processing accuracy of the three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus 1, but once the value can be set to an appropriate value, the need to reset each value is relatively low.</p>
<heading id="h0018">Another Embodiment in Step S1 of Forming Fabricated Object</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> -->

<p id="p0070" num="0070">In the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 4E</figref>, the opening portion 20 (powder removal opening portion 23) may be formed to gradually decrease in size toward the inner side along the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15. In other words, the powder removal opening portion 23 may have a so-called tapered cross-sectional shape along the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">In a case where the cross-sectional shape of the powder removal opening portion 23 along the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15 is a tapered shape, the cross-sectional shape of the plug 40 may also be a tapered shape.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">Accordingly, compared to a case where the size of the powder removal opening portion 23 does not change regardless of the position of the fabricated object 15 in the thickness direction, even when the dimensional accuracy of the powder removal opening portion 23 or the plug 40 decreases, a problem is unlikely to occur when the plug 40 is mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23.</p>
<heading id="h0019">Yet another Embodiment in Step S1 of Forming Fabricated Object</heading>

<p id="p0074" num="0074">In the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, the fabricated object 15 may be formed to include a recessed portion 25 and the opening portion 20 (powder removal opening portion 23), which has a smaller dimension than that of a bottom surface 25a of the recessed portion 25 and is provided in the bottom surface 25a.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">As a result of diligent research by the present inventors, when the thickness of the fabricated object 15 in the vicinity of the powder removal opening portion 23 is relatively thick, and in a case where the powder removal opening portion 23 is provided without providing the recessed portion 25, when the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 is to be welded to the fabricated object 15, the heat capacity of the portion that surrounds the plug 40 in the fabricated object 15 is extremely large compared to the heat capacity of the plug 40. Therefore, the present inventors found that there is a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> concern that the temperature of the plug increases too much before welding the portion that surrounds the plug 40 at the time of welding and the plug melts down.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">By providing the recessed portion 25 in the fabricated object 15 and forming the powder removal opening portion 23 in the bottom surface 25a of the recessed portion 25 as described above, it is possible to reduce the heat capacity of the portion that surrounds the plug 40 in the fabricated object 15 compared to a case where the recessed portion 25 is not provided. Accordingly, even when the thickness of the fabricated object 15 in the vicinity of the powder removal opening portion 23 is relatively thick, it is possible to weld the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">Now, each of the steps of the method of manufacturing a fabricated object will be described for a case where the recessed portion 25 is formed as described above.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">In the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 5A</figref>, the fabricated object 15 is formed to have the recessed portion 25 and the powder removal opening portion 23 provided in the bottom surface 25a. In addition, in the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, the powder removal opening portion 23 is formed such that the dimensions of the powder removal opening portion 23 when the recessed portion 25 is viewed from the outside to the inside of the fabricated object 15 are smaller than the dimensions of the bottom surface 25a.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">In the step S3 of forming the plug, similar to the above-described embodiment, the plug 40 may be formed under the same conditions as the fabrication conditions of the fabricated object 15. In addition, in the step S3 of forming the plug, similar to the above-described embodiment, the plug 40 may be formed at the same time as the fabricated object 15 by forming the plug 40 in the same powder bed 8 as the powder bed 8 on which the fabricated object 15 is formed.</p>

In addition, in the step S7 of mounting the plug, a plug 40 formed, for example, by casting or the like may be mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 rather than the plug 40 formed in the above-described step S3 of forming the plug.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">In the step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 5C</figref>, by welding the plug 40 mounted in the powder removal opening portion 23 to the fabricated object 15 by using an energy beam such as the light beam 90, the plug 40 and the fabricated object 15 are integrated as illustrated in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 5D</figref>. In addition, in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 5D</figref>, a position corresponding to the inner circumferential wall of the powder removal opening portion 23 is indicated by a two-dot chain line.</p>

<p id="p0084" num="0084">Here, in a case where the recessed portion 25 is formed, the method of manufacturing a fabricated object according to some embodiments may further include the step S11 of filling the recessed portion with the filler after the step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">In the step S11 of filling the recessed portion with the filler, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 5E</figref>, the recessed portion 25 is filled with the filler 45. In the step S11 of filling the recessed portion with the filler, the powder removal opening portion 23 is already closed in the step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object, and thus, the opening portion 20 is in a state of being not present in the bottom surface 25a. Therefore, in the step S11 of filling the recessed portion with the filler, the recessed portion 25 may be filled with the filler 45 by, for example, TIG welding, or the recessed portion 25 may be filled with the filler 45 by the fabricating method using, for example, an LMD method.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">Accordingly, the recessed portion 25 can be filled with the filler 45 to make the surface (outer surface) 15b of the fabricated object 15 smooth.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>

<heading id="h0020">Relationship between Dimension of Powder Removal Opening Portion 23 and Dimension of Plug 40</heading>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">In some embodiments, the maximum dimension of the powder removal opening portion 23 is preferably 105% or greater and 110% or less of the maximum dimension of the plug 40. More specifically, the maximum dimension of the powder removal opening portion 23 when viewed from the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15 with respect to the powder removal opening portion 23 is preferably 105% or greater and 110% or less of the maximum dimension of the plug 40 when viewed from the thickness direction.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">For example, when the shape of the powder removal opening portion 23 when viewed from the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15 with respect to the powder removal opening portion 23 is circular, the diameter of the powder removal opening portion 23 may be 105% or greater and 110% or less of the diameter of the plug 40.</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">For example, when the shape of the powder removal opening portion 23 when viewed from the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15 with respect to the powder removal opening portion 23 is elliptical, the length of the long axis of the powder removal opening portion 23 may be 105% or greater and 110% or less of the length of the long axis of the plug 40.</p>

<p id="p0092" num="0092">In other words, in some embodiments, in the step S1 of forming the fabricated object, the opening portion 20 (powder removal opening portion 23) may be formed to have a maximum dimension of 105% or greater and 110% or less of the maximum dimension of the plug 40.</p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Accordingly, the plug 40 can be easily inserted into the powder removal opening portion 23 while the gap between the powder removal opening portion 23 and the plug 40 is not extremely large.</p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> In some embodiments, the dimension of the powder removal opening portion 23 along the thickness direction of the fabricated object 15 with respect to the powder removal opening portion 23 may be substantially the same as the dimension of the plug 40 along the thickness direction. Accordingly, it is possible to substantially eliminate the difference in dimensions of the plug 40 at the inner opening end 23a and the outer opening end 23b. In addition, in a case where the closed portion 19 is recessed more than the portion surrounding the closed portion 19 on the outer surface 15b of the fabricated object 15 after executing the step S9 of welding the plug to the fabricated object, the surface on the outer side (outer surface) 19b of the closed portion 19 may be built up, and may match the height of the surrounding portion of the closed portion 19.</p>

<p id="p0097" num="0097">In particular, when the internal space 17 is a fluid flow path formed in the fabricated object 15, by making the heat-affected region 18 smooth, it is possible to suppress the pressure loss of the fluid that flows through the flow path.</p>

<p id="p0106" num="0106">For example, in the hot part 80 illustrated in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 7</figref>, the cooling flow path 81 is formed as a zigzag flow path.

<p id="p0109" num="0109">Accordingly, it is possible to discharge the residual powder 33 in the cooling flow path 81 to the outside from the powder removal opening portion 23.</p>
