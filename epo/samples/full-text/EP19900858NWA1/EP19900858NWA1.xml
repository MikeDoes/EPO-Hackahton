<heading id="h0002"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present application relates to novel indole compounds, and specifically discloses a compound of formula (II), an isomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and use of the same as an estrogen receptor antagonist in preparing a medicament for treating estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">According to WHO statistics, breast cancer ranks the second among cancers in global population and the first in women in incidence. After years of research, the role of the estrogen-estrogen receptor signaling pathway in the development of breast cancer has been determined; estrogen receptor (ER) has become the most important biomarker of breast cancer. Based on estrogen receptor expression, breast cancers can be classified into estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Among them, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer accounts for more than 70% in breast cancer patients.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Endocrine therapy (ET) for the estrogen-estrogen receptor signaling pathway in breast cancer cells has become the first choice for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer due to its minimal harm and remarkable efficacy. Generally, the first-line endocrine therapy is aromatase inhibitor (AI). Although letrozole, anaromatase inhibitor, has demonstrated good efficacy in treating estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, with the marketing of two drugs of the kind,, the resistance problem of estrogen recepor positive breast cancer to AIs is becoming prominent. A large number of studies suggest that for AIs, the estrogen receptor gene may mutate, mainly in Y537X, producing a estrogen receptor mutant that may keep an excited conformation in the absence of estrogen and continue to function as a receptor to promote breast cancer cell proliferation. As the only marketed selective estrogen receptor down-regulator, fulvestrant has demonstrated good results in treating hormone-resistant breast cancer. However, fulvestrant has many problems for the treatment of AI-resistant ER mutant breast cancer. Due to its poor pharmacokinetics (PK), fulvestrant features zero bioavailability via oral administration, while having a high blood clearance rate. For the above two reasons, this drug can only be administered by intramuscular injection. However, because of its strong lipophilicity, fulvestrant administered by intramuscular injection also has serious problems in tissue distribution, resulting in a clinical response rate of about 50% in breast cancer patients. Also due to the poor PK properties, the current approved dosage of fluvistran cannot cause complete degradation of ER, especially mutant ER, at tissue concentration. Therefore, the therapy is far from optimal for AI-resistant ER-mutant breast cancer. Therefore, the development of medications targeting ER-mutant breast cancer with better PK remains an unmet medical need.</p>

For example, a proton tautomer, also known as a prototropic tautomer, includes the interconversion by proton transfer, such as keto-enol isomerization and imine-enamine isomerization. A valence isomer includes the interconversion by recombination of some bonding electrons. A specific example of the keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion between two tautomers pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one.</p>

If one enantiomer of a certain compound disclosed herein is to be obtained, the desired pure enantiomer can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis or derivatization using a chiral auxiliary, wherein the resulting diastereoisomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group is cleaved. Alternatively, when the molecule contains a basic functional group (such as amino) or an acidic functional group (such as carboxyl), the compound reacts with an appropriate optically active acid or base to form a salt of the diastereoisomer, which is then subjected to diastereoisomeric resolution through conventional methods<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> in the art to get the pure enantiomer. Furthermore, the enantiomer and the diastereoisomer are generally isolated through chromatography using a chiral stationary phase, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (<i>e.g.</i>, carbamate generated from amines). The compound of the present application may contain an unnatural proportion of atomic isotope at one or more of the atoms that constitute the compound. For example, the compound may be labeled with a radioisotope, such as tritium (<sup>3</sup>H), iodine-125 (<sup>125</sup>I), or C-14 (<sup>14</sup>C). For another example, hydrogen can be substituted by deuterium to form a deuterated drug, and the bond formed by deuterium and carbon is firmer than that formed by common hydrogen and carbon. Compared with an un-deuterated drug, the deuterated drug has the advantages of reduced toxic side effect, increased stability, enhanced efficacy, prolonged biological half-life and the like. All isotopic variations of the compound of the present application, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present application.

<p id="p0186" num="0186">The term "substituted" means that one or more hydrogen atoms on a specific atom are substituted by substituents which may include deuterium and hydrogen variants, as long as the valence of the specific atom is normal and the substituted compound is stable. When the substituent is an oxygen (<i>i.e</i>., =O), it means that two hydrogen atoms are substituted. Substitution by oxygen does not occur on aromatic groups. The term "optionally substituted" means that an atom can be substituted by a substituent or not. Unless otherwise specified, the type and number of the substituent may be arbitrary as long as being chemically achievable. When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than once in the constitution or structure of a compound, the variable is independently defined in each case. Thus, for example, if a group is substituted by 0-2 R, the group can be optionally substituted by two R at most, and the definition of R in each case is independent. Furthermore, a combination of a substituent and/or a variant thereof is permissible only if the combination can result in a stable compound.</p>

Three days before the xenograft, the mice were inoculated with 0.36 mg of 60-day sustained-release estrogen tablets subcutaneously on the left shoulder. In the logarithmic growth phase, the cells were collected and counted. The cell density was adjusted to 10×10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL, added with an equal volume of Matrigel and mixed for inoculation. Each mouse was xenografted subcutaneously with 0.2 mL of MCF-7 tumor cell suspension (10×10<sup>6</sup>) on the right shoulder. On the 14th day after tumor cell xenograft, the mice were grouped and administered the drugs once a day, with an average tumor volume of 200 mm<sup>3</sup> and a body weight of 22.0-23.0 g. Tumor volume and body weight were measured twice a week after grouping. The tumor growth rate (T/C) and tumor growth inhibition rate (TGI) were calculated for the last tumor measurement data on the 27th day after grouping, and the anti-tumor efficacy of the compound was evaluated by TGI (%) or relative tumor proliferation rate T/C (%). TGI (%), reflects the tumor growth inhibition rate. TGI (%) = [(1-(average tumor volume at the end of treatment in a treatment group - average tumor volume at the start of treatment in the treatment group))/(average tumor volume at the end of treatment in the solvent control group - average tumor volume at the start of treatment in the solvent control group)] × 100%, relative tumor proliferation rate T/C (%) = T<sub>RTV</sub>/C<sub>RTV</sub> × 100% (T<sub>RTV</sub>: average RTV in the treatment group; C<sub>RTV</sub>: average RTV in the negative control group). Relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated based on the results of tumor measurement. The<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> formula is RTV = V<sub>t</sub>/V<sub>0</sub>, wherein V<sub>0</sub> is the tumor volume measured when grouping and administering (i.e., D<sub>0</sub>), and V<sub>t</sub> is the tumor volume at a certain measurement, the data of T<sub>RTV</sub> and C<sub>RTV</sub> should be measured on the same day.
