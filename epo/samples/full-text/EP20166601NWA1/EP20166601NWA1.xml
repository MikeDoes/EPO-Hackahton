<heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples of different light illumination systems and/or light emitting diode ("LED") implementations will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. These examples are not mutually exclusive, and features found in one example may be combined with features found in one or more other examples to achieve additional implementations. Accordingly, it will be understood that the examples shown in the accompanying drawings are provided for illustrative purposes only and they are not intended to limit the disclosure in any way. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element may be termed a second element and a second element may be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term "and/or" may include any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region, or substrate is referred to as being "on" or extending "onto" another element, it may be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being "directly on" or extending "directly onto" another element, there may be no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being "connected" or "coupled" to another element, it may be directly connected or coupled to the other element and/or connected or coupled to the other element via one or more intervening elements. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being "directly connected" or "directly coupled" to another element, there are no intervening elements present between the element and the other element. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the element in addition to any orientation depicted in the figures.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Relative terms such as "below," "above," "upper,", "lower," "horizontal" or "vertical" may be used herein to describe a relationship of one element, layer, or region to another element, layer, or region as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, whether the LEDs, LED arrays, electrical components and/or electronic components are housed on one, two or more electronics boards may also depend on design constraints and/or application.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Semiconductor light emitting devices (LEDs) or optical power emitting devices, such as devices that emit ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) optical power, are among the most efficient light sources currently available. These devices (hereinafter "LEDs"), may include light emitting diodes, resonant cavity light emitting diodes, vertical cavity laser diodes, edge emitting lasers, or the like. Due to their compact size and lower power requirements, for example, LEDs may be attractive candidates for many different applications. For example, they may be used as light sources (e.g., flash lights and camera flashes) for hand-held battery-powered devices, such as cameras and cell phones. They may also be used, for example, for automotive lighting, heads up display (HUD) lighting, horticultural lighting, street lighting, torch for video, general illumination (e.g., home, shop, office and studio lighting, theater/stage lighting and architectural lighting), augmented reality (AR) lighting, virtual reality (VR) lighting, as back lights for displays, and IR spectroscopy. A single LED may provide light that is less bright than an incandescent light source, and, therefore, multi-junction devices or arrays of LEDs (such as monolithic LED arrays, micro LED arrays, etc.) may be used for applications where more brightness is desired or required.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view of an example LED array 102. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the LED array 102 is an array of emitters 120. LED arrays may be used for any application, such as those requiring precision control of LED array emitters. Emitters 120 in the LED array 102 may be individually addressable or may be addressable in groups/subsets.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">An exploded view of a 3x3 portion of the LED array 102 is also shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in the 3x3 portion exploded view, the LED array 102 may include emitters 120 that each have a width w<sub>1</sub>. In embodiments, the width w<sub>1</sub> may be approximately 100µm or less (e.g., 30 µm). Lanes 122 between the emitters 120 may be a width, w<sub>2</sub>, wide. In embodiments, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> width w<sub>2</sub> may be approximately 20µm or less (e.g., 5µm). The lanes 122 may provide an air gap between adjacent emitters or may contain other material. A distance di from the center of one emitter 120 to the center of an adjacent emitter 120 may be approximately 120µm or less (e.g., 30 µm). It will be understood that the widths and distances provided herein are examples only and that actual widths and/or dimensions may vary.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">It will be understood that, although rectangular emitters arranged in a symmetric matrix are shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, emitters of any shape and arrangement may be applied to the embodiments described herein. For example, the LED array 102 of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> may include over 20,000 emitters in any applicable arrangement, such as a 200x100 matrix, a symmetric matrix, a non-symmetric matrix, or the like. It will also be understood that multiple sets of emitters, matrixes, and/or boards may be arranged in any applicable format to implement the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">As mentioned above, LED arrays, such as the LED array 102, may include emitters that have fine pitch and line spacing. An LED array such as this may be referred to as a micro LED array or simply a micro LED. A micro LED may include an array of individual emitters provided on a substrate or may be a single silicon wafer or die divided into segments that form the emitters. The latter type of micro LED may be referred to as a monolithic LED. Additionally, such arrays may require significant power to power them, such as 60 watts or more, and, therefore, may emit significant heat duration operation. Accordingly, for such arrays, a circuit board is needed that can accommodate the fine line space and provide sufficient heat dissipation.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Embodiments described herein may provide for a circuit board, an LED lighting system incorporating the circuit board and methods of manufacture that may support an LED array with a fine line space and may provide sufficient heat dissipation to meet the heat requirements of such an LED array. Such LED arrays and LED lighting systems may be used in various applications, including, for example, camera flash and vehicle lighting system applications.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view of a circuit board 200. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the circuit board 200 includes a ceramic carrier 202. The ceramic carrier 202 may have a top surface 218 and a bottom surface 214. A body 212 is disposed on the top surface 218 of the ceramic carrier 202. The body 212 has a top surface 220 and a bottom surface 216, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> bottom surface 216 is disposed on the top surface 218 of the ceramic carrier 202. The body 212 may be formed from layers 204 of a dielectric material. A number vias 206 are formed through the layers 204 of the dielectric material. In embodiments, the vias are formed completely through a thickness (ti) of the layers 204 of the dielectric material. The vias 206 may be filled and/or plated with a metal material. Where the vias are formed completely through the entire thickness of the layers 204 of the dielectric material, the metal in the vias 206 contacts the ceramic carrier 202. A metal pad 208 may be disposed on a surface of each of the vias 206 opposite the ceramic carrier 202.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The vias 206 may be arranged in pairs to enable contacting LED devices or emitters that each may include a pair of metal contacts. In embodiments, the vias 206 may be micro-vias or slots and may have a width w<sub>3</sub>, and a space between adjacent pairs of vias may have a width w<sub>4</sub>. In embodiments w<sub>3</sub> may be in a range of 50 µm to 200 µm, and w<sub>4</sub> may be in a range of 20 µm to 200 µm. The small widths of the vias 206 and the small spacing between pairs of the vias 206 may enable use of the circuit board 200 with an LED array, such as the LED array 100 of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, with fine line spacing.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The vias 206 may be filled and/or plated with a metal material that has good thermal conductivity. In embodiments, the metal material may be a copper, silver or nickel material. The ceramic carrier 202 may be formed from a material with high thermal conductivity and high electrical resistivity. In embodiments, the ceramic carrier 202 may be formed from Aluminum Nitride (AlN), Zirconia (ZrO<sub>2)</sub> or Aluminum Oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The use of such a material for the ceramic carrier 202 enables the vias 206 to be used both to make electrical connections to the conductive pads 208 and also to dissipate heat from any LED array or semiconductor device mounted on the conductive pads 208. In other words, when the vias 206 are formed through the entire thickness of the layers 204 of the dielectric material, the vias 206 may dissipate heat from an LED array or other semiconductor device mounted on the metal pads 208 to the ceramic carrier 202, which may quickly dissipate the heat into the environment due to its high thermal conductivity. Further, because the ceramic carrier 202 has good electrical resistivity, it may prevent shorting of the vias 206 to each other.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">As mentioned above, the body 212 may have a thickness ti. In embodiments, the thickness ti may be in a range 20 µm to 50 µm. Thus, the thickness ti may be kept relatively thin to minimize the insulation contributed by the circuit board.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view of an LED lighting system 300 that includes the circuit board 202 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> with an array of light-emitting diode (LED) devices 304 mounted thereon. While the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> includes an array of individual LED devices 304, the embodiments described herein are applicable to any type of LED array, such as the LED array 102 of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, which may be an array of individual LED devices or a monolithic LED array that includes a single silicon wafer or die divided into segments that form the emitters. When a monolithic LED array is used, each of the emitters in the array may have a pair of metal contacts that may be electrically coupled to corresponding pairs of metal pads on the circuit board (e.g., via solder).</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the LED devices 304 includes a semiconductor structure 308, a wavelength converting layer 306 over the semiconductor structure 308 and two metal contacts 310a and 310b. The semiconductor structure may be any type of semiconductor structure that emits light when excited and may include one or more p-type regions, n-type regions and active, light-emitting regions. In embodiments, the two contacts 310a and 310b may be a p-type electrode and an n-type electrode, respectively. The wavelength converting layer 306 may be remote from, proximal to, or directly above the semiconductor structure 308. The active layer in the semiconductor structure 308 emits light into the wavelength converting layer 306 when turned on, and the wavelength converting layer 306 acts to further modify the wavelength of the light emitted by the active layer. The wavelength converting layer 306 may include any luminescent material, such as, for example, phosphor particles in a transparent or translucent binder or matrix, or a ceramic phosphor element, which absorbs light of one wavelength and emits light of a different wavelength.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the pairs of contacts 310a and 310b of each of the LED devices 304 is electrically coupled (e.g., via solder) to a corresponding pair of the metal pads 208 on the circuit board 200. A soldermask layer 302 is provided on the top surface 220 of the circuit board 200 in areas that are not occupied by metal pads 208. In embodiments, the soldermask layer 302 may be any layer or type of material that protects the circuit board and/or reflects light.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">As mentioned above, an LED lighting system, such as illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, may be used in a number of different applications, and may be particularly useful in vehicle headlamp systems and flash applications where closely packed LED arrays and/or individually addressable<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> LED devices or emitters may be desirable. <figref idref="f0003">FIGs. 4</figref>, <figref idref="f0004">5</figref>, <figref idref="f0005">6</figref> and <figref idref="f0006">7</figref> are diagrams of example application systems that may incorporate LED lighting systems, such as the LED lighting system 300 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idref="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram of an example vehicle headlamp system 400 that may incorporate an LED lighting system, such as the LED lighting system 300 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. The example vehicle headlamp system 400 illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> includes power lines 402, a data bus 404, an input filter and protection module 406, a bus transceiver 408, a sensor module 410, an LED direct current to direct current (DC/DC) module 412, a logic low-dropout (LDO) module 414, a micro-controller 416 and an active head lamp 418. In embodiments, the active head lamp 418 may include an LED lighting system, such as the LED lighting system 300 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The power lines 402 may have inputs that receive power from a vehicle, and the data bus 404 may have inputs/outputs over which data may be exchanged between the vehicle and the vehicle headlamp system 400. For example, the vehicle headlamp system 400 may receive instructions from other locations in the vehicle, such as instructions to turn on turn signaling or turn on headlamps, and may send feedback to other locations in the vehicle if desired. The sensor module 410 may be communicatively coupled to the data bus 404 and may provide additional data to the vehicle headlamp system 400 or other locations in the vehicle related to, for example, environmental conditions (e.g., time of day, rain, fog, or ambient light levels), vehicle state (e.g., parked, in-motion, speed of motion, or direction of motion), and presence/position of other objects (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). A headlamp controller that is separate from any vehicle controller communicatively coupled to the vehicle data bus may also be included in the vehicle headlamp system 400. In <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the headlamp controller may be a micro-controller, such as micro-controller (µc) 416. The micro-controller 416 may be communicatively coupled to the data bus 404.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The input filter and protection module 406 may be electrically coupled to the power lines 402 and may, for example, support various filters to reduce conducted emissions and provide power immunity. Additionally, the input filter and protection module 406 may provide electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, load-dump protection, alternator field decay protection, and/or reverse polarity protection.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The LED DC/DC module 412 may be coupled between the filter and protection module 406 and the active headlamp 418 to receive filtered power and provide a drive current to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> power LEDs in the LED array in the active headlamp 418. The LED DC/DC module 412 may have an input voltage between 7 and 18 volts with a nominal voltage of approximately 13.2 volts and an output voltage that may be slightly higher (e.g., 0.3 volts) than a maximum voltage for the LED array (e.g., as determined by factor or local calibration and operating condition adjustments due to load, temperature or other factors).</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The logic LDO module 414 may be coupled to the the input filter and protection module 406 to receive the filtered power. The logic LDO module 414 may also be coupled to the micro-controller 414 and the active headlamp 418 to provide power to the micro-controller 464 and/or the silicon backplane (e.g., CMOS logic) in the active headlamp 418.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The bus transceiver 408 may have, for example, a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) or serial peripheral interface (SPI) interface and may be coupled to the micro-controller 416. The micro-controller 416 may translate vehicle input based on, or including, data from the sensor module 410.

In embodiments, a high density interconnect buildup process with finer geometries is used to build up dielectric layers on the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> ceramic carrier. Various dielectric materials may be used, such as, for example, organic materials, or, more specifically, a Bismaleimide Triazine (BT) resin. The ceramic carrier (e.g., AlN carrier) may be used as the backbone for the buildup process.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In the example method 800 of <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, first metal pads are formed on a ceramic carrier (802), such as an AlN carrier, as described above. <figref idref="f0008">FIGs. 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D</figref>, <figref idref="f0009">9E, 9F and 9G</figref> provide example structures at various points in the formation of first metal pads.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In embodiments, the method may be used to simultaneously manufacture multiple circuit boards. For example, as shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9A</figref>, two ceramic carriers 902a and 902b may be attached to one another using, for example, an adhesive 904 to form a structure 900A. In embodiments, the adhesive may be a tape or a temporary glue. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9A</figref>, the adhesive 904 is disposed between a first ceramic carrier 902a and a second ceramic carrier 902b. While the examples in <figref idref="f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012">FIGs. 9A-9Q</figref> illustrate simultaneous manufacture of multiple circuit boards, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a similar method may be used to manufacture a single circuit board (e.g., by not bonding two carriers and not performing processing on both carriers).</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9B</figref>, a layer of a metal material 906a and 906b may be formed on outer surfaces (e.g., the surfaces that are not bonded together) of the first and second carriers 902a and 902b. In embodiments, the metal layer may be formed by sputtering. For example, copper sputtering may be performed on the structure 900A to form a thin film of copper on the outer surfaces of the carriers 902a and 902b. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand, however, that other methods and materials may be used to form the metal layer on the surfaces of the first and second carriers 902a and 902b.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9C</figref>, a film 908a and 908b may be formed on each of the metal layers 906a and 906b to form a structure 900C. In embodiments, the film may be a dry film, such as a photoresist, formed using dry film lamination. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand, however, that other methods, such as spin coating, may be used to form the film 908a and 908b on the surfaces of the metal layers 906a and 906b.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 9D</figref>, the structure 900C may undergo an imaging or photolithography process to remove portions of the film 908a and 908b to form openings in the film and form a structure 900D. In embodiments, this may be performed by placing a pattern 910a and 910b, such as a glass pattern, over the structure 900C and exposing the structure 900C<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> to light (e.g., ultraviolet (UV) light) emitted through the pattern. This may result in the UV light impinging on portions of the film 908a and 908b that are desired to be removed or, alternatively, on portions of the film 908a and 908b that are not to be removed.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown in 9E, desired portions of the film 908a and 908b may be removed, for example, by applying a developer to the structure 900D. Different types of developers may be used.

Exposure of the structure 900D to the developer may result in the structure 900E with openings 911a and 911b formed in the film 908a and 908b. The openings 911a and 911b may form a portion of the vias 206 in the circuit board 200 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>

In embodiments, the openings extend through the entirety of the film 908a and 908b and leave corresponding regions of the ceramic carriers 902a and 902b exposed. The openings 911a and 911b may be plated and/or otherwise filled with a metal material (e.g., copper) to form metal-plated and/or filled openings 912a and 912b.</p>

This may be performed, for example, by stripping away the remaining portions of the film 908a and 908b and then performing copper or other metal etching on the portions of the metal layer 906a and 906b underneath. The resulting panel may then be ready for further build up processes.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, a layer of a dielectric material may be formed over the first metal pads (804). <figref idref="f0010">FIG. 9H</figref> provides an example structure 900H showing the layers of the dielectric material 914a and 914b formed over the first metal pads 912a and 912b.

In embodiments, the vias 916a and 916b may be micro-vias or slots and may be formed, for example, using laser ablation or drilling, although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other methods may be used. The vias 916a and 916b may form another part of the vias 206 in the circuit board 200 of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. Combined, the openings 911a and 911b and the vias 916a and 916b may form the vias 206 formed through the entire thickness ti of the dielectric layers 204 in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">The vias may be filled with a metal material (808). <figref idref="f0010">FIG. 9J</figref> illustrates an example structure 900J showing the vias 916a and 916b filled with a metal material 918a and 918b. In embodiments, the vias may be filled using copper plating, which may leave a layer of the metal material 918a and 918b on the outer-most surfaces of the dielectric material 914a and 914b and the vias 916a and 916b, as shown. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand, however, that other techniques may be used to fill the vias 916a and 916b.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">A second metal pad may be formed on each of the vias (810) to form, for example, metal pads on the outer-most surface of the circuit board. <figref idref="f0011">FIGs. 9K, 9L, 9M</figref>, <figref idref="f0012">9N, 9O, 9P and 9Q</figref> provide example structures at various points in the formation of the second metal pads.</p>

<p id="p0052" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 9L</figref>, the structure 900K may undergo an imaging or photolithography process to remove portions of the film 920a and 920b in regions between the vias 916a and 916b to form a structure 900L. In embodiments, this may be performed by placing a pattern 922a and 922b, such as a glass pattern, over the structure 900K and exposing the structure 900K to light (e.g., ultraviolet (UV) light) emitted through the pattern. This may result in the UV light impinging on portions of the film 920a and 920b that are desired to be removed or, alternatively, on portions of the film 920a and 920b that are not to be removed.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 9M</figref>, desired portions of the film 920a and 920b may be removed, for example, by applying a developer to the structure 900L.

In embodiments, the portions of the film 920a and 920b that were exposed to the light in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 9L</figref> may become soluble to the developer or the portions of the film 920a and 920b that were not exposed to the light in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 9L</figref> may become soluble to the developer. Exposure of the structure 900L to the developer may result in the structure 900M with portions of the film 920a and 920b remaining over the vias 916a and 916b.</p>
