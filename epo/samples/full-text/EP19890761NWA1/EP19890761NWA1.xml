<heading id="h0001"><b>Technical Field</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of low-voltage appliances, and more particularly, to a circuit breaker.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Since a test mechanism of a circuit breaker is limited by a space of a housing, a single breakpoint structure is usually used in a test loop of the test mechanism. However, when the circuit breaker is switched off, if a test button of the test mechanism is pressed, a voltage to ground may appear at an outlet end of the circuit breaker due to the conduction of the test loop, which leads to a risk of electric shock during use, and is also failed to meet safety regulations of specific areas, thus having certain limitations. Therefore, some circuit breakers change the test loop of the test mechanism into a double breakpoint structure, one of the double breakpoints is controlled by a handle, and the test loop can only be conducted by pressing the test button when the handle is switched on. However, speeds of conduction and disconnection of the breakpoint are affected by speeds of switching on and switching off of the handle. If the handle is reset slowly, then the breakpoint is disconnected slowly, and if the circuit breaker is connected reversely at the moment, the test loop may be disconnected slowly when the test button is pressed, leading to heating up and burning up of a coil of the circuit breaker, and failure of the circuit breaker, thus seriously affecting the reliability of the circuit breaker.</p>

<p id="p0020" num="0020">The specific implementations of a circuit breaker of the present invention are further described hereinafter with reference to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIG. 1 to FIG. 27</figref>. The circuit breaker of the present invention is not limited to the descriptions in the following embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002">FIG. 1 to FIG. 4</figref>, and <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 9 to FIG. 10</figref>, a circuit breaker of the present invention includes a housing, and a circuit breaker phase pole 1 and a leakage protection pole 2 arranged on two sides of the housing side by side. A partition plate 32 is arranged between the circuit breaker phase pole 1 and the leakage protection pole 2. The circuit breaker phase pole 1 includes a static contact 111 and a moving contact 112 arranged oppositely and connected to a circuit respectively, and the moving contact 112 is installed on the phase pole operating mechanism 14 to swing and match with the static contact 111. The leakage protection pole 2 includes a zero-sequence current transformer 21, a leakage operating mechanism 22, and a leakage testing mechanism 25. A major loop of the circuit breaker phase pole 1 passes through the zero-sequence current transformer 21, and the zero-sequence current transformer 21 is capable of unlocking the phase pole operating mechanism 14 through the leakage operating mechanism 22 to drive the moving contact 112 to be separated from the static contact 111 when leakage current occurs in the major loop.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The leakage testing mechanism 25 includes an elastic member 26, a test button 29, and a first contact member 27 and a second contact member 28 respectively connected to the major loop of the circuit breaker phase pole 1.

When the first contact portion 261 and the second contact portion 262 contact with the first contact member 27 and the second contact member 28 respectively, the test loop is capable of being conducted to generate a leakage test signal in the major loop.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the circuit breaker of the present invention, the testing mechanism 25 forms the test loop with double breakpoints through two contact points of the first contact portion 261 and the second contact portion 262 on the elastic member 26, which can not only ensure that the test loop is conducted by pressing the test button 29 when the circuit breaker phase pole 1 is switched off, and improve a reliability of the circuit breaker, but also increase an action speed of the leakage operating mechanism 22 or the phase pole operating mechanism 14 by matching between the first contact portion 261 and the leakage operating mechanism 22 or the phase pole operating mechanism 14, especially when overload or leakage current occurs in the circuit, the leakage operating mechanism 22 may be helped to trip the circuit beaker faster to cut off the circuit.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idref="f0003">FIG. 10</figref> shows an implementation of the phase pole operating mechanism 14.

The other end of the connecting rod 144 is hinged with a circuit breaker handle 31 extending out of the housing. When the jump buckle 142 and the lock catch 143 are clasped with each other, the phase pole operating mechanism 14 keeps balance, the circuit breaker handle 31 is capable of driving the phase pole operating mechanism 14, and then the moving contact 112 is driven to contact with the static contact 111 to conduct the major loop and separate from the static contact to disconnect the major loop, so as to switch on and off the circuit breaker. Moreover, energy is stored for the circuit breaker energy storage member during switching on.</p>
