<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a solanaceous plant resistant to a virus of genus <i>Begomovirus</i> causing tomato yellow leaf curl symptoms, a solanaceous plant cell, and a method for producing the solanaceous plant.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus; hereinafter, may be abbreviated to "TYLCV"), a representative virus causing tomato yellow leaf curl disease, is one of a relatively new plant virus found in Israel in 1964. TYLCV and other viruses of genus <i>Begomovirus</i> (the genus where TYLCV belongs) are found worldwide and are causing damages to various plants and farm products mainly in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. Begomoviruses can be either a single-segmented type or a double-segmented type (i.e., monopartite or bipartite, respectively), and TYLCV is a monopartite virus. Distribution of TYLCV-related viruses is diverse and occurrence of the viruses are found worldwide. For example, tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus), a related species of TYLCV, is found only in Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, TYLCV is prevailing worldwide mainly in tomato-producing areas (see NPL 1).</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In Japan, tomato yellow leaf curl disease caused by TYLCV were found simultaneously in Nagasaki, Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures in 1996 and, thereafter,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> occurrence of the disease is spreading rapidly in green house tomato producing areas. Especially from year 2000 onwards, occurrence of the disease is enormous in Kyushu area which is a major production area for raw eating tomatoes, and there is a continuous increase in number of farmers in which all of their cultivated tomatoes suffer from TYLCV damage. Each prefecture is giving strict alerts to the farmers and conducting thorough TYLCV prevention by pesticide spray, etc., but the occurrence of TYLCV damage is still continuing and spreading throughout the country. Even in 2016, TYLCV was a disease causing largest financial damage in tomato production.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Symptoms of the tomato yellow leaf curl disease start with yellowing of tomato leaves and, then, edges of the leaves gradually curl downwards and end in deformation (see, for example, <figref idref="f0003">Figure 3(b)</figref>). When the symptoms become severe, a whole plant looks as if it has been permed. Although fruits show no symptoms, when a tomato plant gets infected with TYLCV at an early stage of cultivation, only up to about 2 rows of fruits develop in each fruit cluster and this results in a very large damage of 70 to 80% loss of harvested fruit yield.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Tomato yellow leaf curl disease is transmitted by silverleaf whitefly (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i> (<i>Gennadius</i>)), an insect vector for TYLCV, which spreads the disease permanently.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, there is no effective anti-viral drug against the plant viruses <i>per se.</i> Central methods used so far for preventing plant viruses in general are spraying of an insecticide against an insect vector transmitting the viruses, use of insect proof nets or insect repellent materials for physically avoiding an entrance of the insect vector, soil disinfestation, removal of infected plants, sterilization of cultivation and management instruments, use of barrier crops, and cultivation of virus resistant crops.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The same applies to the prevention of TYLCV. Major countermeasure is breakage of TYLCV infection cycle by, for example, control of silverleaf whitefly which is, an insect vector for TYLCV, and early removal of infected plants.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">An insect proof net with a mesh size of 0.4 mm or less is effective for preventing the entrance of silverleaf whitefly, but use of such an insect proof net for prevention may cause a temperature elevation inside a cultivation facility. Therefore, actual use of the insect proof net is difficult at the cultivation spots.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, in major tomato production areas, such as Kyushu area, tomatoes of various cultivation types with different cultivation seasons are being cultivated and, therefore, tomatoes are being cultivated somewhere throughout the year. Silverleaf whitefly carrying TYLCV moves between fields and cultivation facilities while adapting to different cultivation types of tomatoes and does not perish even during cold winter. Such lack of breakage in the TYLCV infection cycle makes TYLCV prevention difficult.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Recently, an insecticide resistant silverleaf whitefly, <i>Bemisia tabaci-Biotype</i> Q, is beginning to prevail and the prevention by insecticides is facing a limit.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">In connection with a TYLCV resistant tomato, genes such as Ty-1, Ty-2, and Ty-3 which are so-called resistance genes have been found in wild type tomato. However, presence of these genes suppress disease symptoms, but cannot prevent TYLCV infection <i>per se.</i></p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Tomato varieties carrying TYLCV resistance genes, which have been incorporated therein by breeding, are already available in the market. However, due to the properties of such genes, all varieties are known to be infected by TYLCV and the virus is known to proliferate in vivo in tomatoes. Accordingly, failure to control silverleaf whitefly during the cultivation of the tomatoes carrying an introduced TYLCV resistance gene results in the tomatoes carrying TYLCV. Such tomatoes will be a source of infection even when the disease symptoms are suppressed in the tomatoes, and cause surrounding TYLCV sensitive tomato varieties to be exposed to the danger of infection (see, for example, NPLs 2 to 4).</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The above-mentioned problems are not peculiar to TYLCV, and are common to all viruses of the genus <i>Begomovirus</i> which are transmitted by silverleaf whitefly cause tomato<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> yellow leaf curl symptoms.</p>

<heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Satisfactory prevention of the prevalence of viruses belonging to the genus <i>Begomovirus</i> which cause tomato yellow leaf curl symptom, such as TYLCV, was difficult by conventional methods for preventing plant viruses. Further, even when the symptoms of TYLCV infection are suppressed in solanaceous plant varieties by the introduced TYLCV resistance genes, TYLCV still proliferates in the plant body and, therefore, the TYLCV infection cycle could not be broken completely.</p>

In the present embodiment, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plant is a plant having the properties of inhibiting the infection by TYLCV, suppressing the proliferation of TYLCV when infected, and/or suppressing the expression of TYLCV infection symptoms. The TYLCV resistant solanaceous plant is preferably a plant having a property of inhibiting the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> TYLCV infection, or when infected, inhibiting the proliferation of TYLCV.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In the present embodiment, the "tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)" refers to viruses classified under the family Geminiviridae <i>(Geminiviridae)</i> and genus <i>Begomovirus</i> (Begomoviruses), which have a circular single DNA as a monopartite genome and a diplococcal morphology in which two spherical virions, each having a diameter of about 20 nm, are linked together.</p>

<heading id="h0012">(eIF4E gene)</heading>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The eIF4E gene is a gene encoding "eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 4E," that is the translation initiation factor 4E of eukaryotes. The eIF4E is one type of translation<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> initiation factors in eukaryotes, and has an important role in initiating protein synthesis. eIF4E, together with eIF(iso)4E, constitutes eIF4E family. Solanaceous plants may have plurality of isoforms of eIF4E. For example, in tomatoes, eIF4E is known to have two isoforms which exist on chromosome 2 and chromosome 3, respectively. Further, one type of eIF(iso)4E is known to exist in tomatoes and is on chromosome 9.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Genes homologous to the tomato eIF4E are known to exist in other solanaceous plants too. For example, in hot peppers, genes pvr1 and pvr2 on chromosome 4 are known as genes homologous to the tomato eIF4E (furthermore, pvr1 and pvr2 are in a relation of an allele). In addition, pvr6 on chromosome 3 is known as a gene homologous to the tomato IF(iso)4E.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">All of the members constituting the eIF4E family (such as the above-mentioned eIF4E isoforms) and other eIF4E homologous genes known from other solanaceous plants are the homologous genes of the eIF4E gene which are used in the present invention.</p>

Herein, the "cDNA sequence" is a DNA sequence synthesized by reverse transcription from an mRNA transcribed from a gene, and is a DNA sequence without introns found in the gene and consisting only of protein coding regions.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In addition, in the present embodiment, the "gene homologous to the eIF4E gene" is preferably a gene having a cDNA sequence which either comprises a nucleotide sequence having sequence homology to the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, or consists of a nucleotide sequence having sequence homology to the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. There is no particular limitation on the degree of sequence homology with the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, but the sequence homology is preferably at least 85% and less than 100%. Minimum sequence homology<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> may be any value, such as at least 87%, at least 90%, at least 93%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, and at least 99.5%. Homology between the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 and the cDNA sequence of the homologous gene may be determined by conventional methods. For example, homology between nucleotide sequences may be determined using conventional homology search programs, such as BLAST.</p>
<heading id="h0013">(RLK gene)</heading>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The RLK gene is a tomato gene encoding "Receptor-Like Kinase," that is a kinase resembling a receptor. RLK is called BAM1 (Barely Any Meristem 1) in Arabidopsis and the gene encodes CLAVATA1 related receptor-like kinase protein necessary for meristematic functions of shoots and flowers which are related to the formation of leaves and gametes. Further, in Arabidopsis, presence of BAM2 which is highly homologous to BAM1 has been recognized, and from recent studies, presence of a highly homologous homologue in tomato is beginning to be understood. When the RLK used in the present embodiment is the "RLK1" (Solyc02g091840 on chromosome 2), such a homologue is a protein known as "RLK2." Regarding BAM1 of Arabidopsis, although relationship with C4 protein of a close relative to TYLCV and involvement in replication of a closely related virus have been suggested, till now, there is no report on a relationship between tomato RLK and TYLCV.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In the present embodiment, the "RLK gene" is preferably a gene having a cDNA sequence which either comprises the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:4, or consists of the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:4.</p>

For example, homology between nucleotide sequences may be determined using conventional homology search programs, such as BLAST.</p>
<heading id="h0014">(deltaCOP gene)</heading>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The deltaCOP gene is a gene encoding a component of coatomer complex COPI. Although details on exact role of COPI are unknown, relations with golgi bodies and with vesicle transport to the golgi bodies are known. In the studies on Arabidopsis, the vesicle transport is related to the transport of a movement protein in a virus of genus <i>Geminivirus</i> and, therefore, relation between the COPI and virus infection has been suggested.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In tomatoes, presence of 2 types of deltaCOP genes, one on chromosome 1 and the other on chromosome 10 (Solyc01g103480, Solyc10g038120) have been recognized.

<p id="p0044" num="0044">The NSI gene is considered a gene for a nuclear shuttle protein interactor. In the studies on Arabidopsis, the NSI gene has been shown to interact with a movement protein (NSP; nuclear shuttle protein) of Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) belonging to the genus <i>Begomovirus.</i> Therefore, the NSI gene is suspected to participate in virus infection and replication of the CaLCuV. In tomatoes, the NSI gene is present on chromosome 10 as acetyltransferase-like protein gene (Solyc10g074910).

<heading id="h0016">(TYLCV resistance gene)</heading>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the present embodiment, the solanaceous plants have a mutation in at least one gene selected from the group consisting of the translation initiation factor eIF4E gene and a gene homologous thereto, the receptor-like kinase RLK gene and a gene homologous thereto, the coatomer complex deltaCOP gene and a gene homologous thereto, and the nuclear shuttle protein interactor NSI gene and a gene homologous thereto (hereinafter, a gene having a mutation is also referred to as a "TYLCV resistance gene"). The mutation either inhibits the expression of the mutated gene or makes a protein encoded by the mutated gene to be non-functional for TYLCV. The protein which is non-functional for TYLCV refers to either a protein which cannot be used by TYLCV during its infection and replication, or a protein which reduces the infection and replication of TYLCV. In one aspect, the TYLCV resistance gene may be a gene which has be mutated to no longer encode a protein.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Although not bound by any theory, during plant infection, TYLCV is considered to<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> use a specific eIF4E isoform among the plurality of eIF4E isoforms present in a solanaceous plant. When a gene encoding the specific isoform used by TYLCV (i.e., eIF4E functional for TYLCV) has a mutation, and the mutation either prevents the production of the specific eIF4E protein used by the TYLCV or causes the produced eIF4E protein to be non-functional for TYLCV, progression of translation of proteins necessary for virus infection and proliferation which are encoded by the viral genome is likely to be blocked. Alternatively, the infection and proliferation of TYLCV may be inhibited due to incomplete function of a TYLCV protein which needs an interaction with the eIF4E protein. Solanaceous plants are considered to acquire TYLCV resistance in these manner.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">On the other hand, even when one of the plurality of eIF4E homologues present in the solanaceous plant becomes mutated, either the plant itself is capable of using other homologues. Alternatively, the plant itself is capable of using the eIF4E protein non-functional for TYLCV. Accordingly, TYLCV resistance can be given to the plant without causing adverse effects on the growth of host solanaceous plant.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">Regarding RLK, as explained above, the presence of RLK2 highly homologous to RLK1 (Solyc02g091840 on chromosome 2) is known, and the two RLKs are considered to exist in plants while assisting each other.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">As explained above, two types of homologues exist for the deltaCOP gene, and the two homologues are considered to exist while assisting each other.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">In addition, the NSI gene is understood to be an acetyltransferase-like gene, and there are 2 types of such genes in tomato.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">As explained above, the solanaceous plants having the TYLCV resistance gene acquire TYLCV resistance. For example, a plant may be judged as having the "TYLCV resistance" when the amount of accumulated TYLCV in a plant body is the same or less than the amount in a plant without TYLCV inoculation on day 20 or more post TYLCV inoculation, and/or when symptoms of TYLCV infection cannot be observed visually on day<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> 20 or more post TYLCV inoculation. Specifically, as shown in the below-mentioned Examples, TYLCV resistance of plants may be judged by: infecting plants with TYLCV using a routine procedure, and determining the amount of accumulated TYLCV in plant bodies by conventional methods, such as ELISA, PCR, and the like. In addition, TYLCV resistance of plants may be judged by determining the presence or absence of TYLCV infection symptoms (mosaic pattern and yellowing of leaves, fern leaves, dwarfing, necrosis, etc.) in the TYLCV infected plants.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">As long as the solanaceous plants have the above-mentioned TYLCV resistance, the gene mutation may be present in at least one gene selected from a group consisting of the translation initiation factor eIF4E gene and a gene homologous thereto, the receptor-like kinase RLK gene and a gene homologous thereto, the coatomer complex deltaCOP gene and a gene homologous thereto, and the nuclear shuttle protein interactor NSI gene and a gene homologous thereto. Therefore, the present embodiment includes: solanaceous plants having a mutation in the translation initiation factor eIF4E gene and and/or the gene homologous thereto; solanaceous plants having a mutation in the receptor-like kinase RLK gene and/or the gene homologous thereto; solanaceous plants having a mutation in the coatomer complex deltaCOP gene and/or the gene homologous thereto; solanaceous plants having a mutation in the nuclear shuttle protein interactor NSI gene and/or the gene homologous thereto; and solanaceous plants having mutations in at least two genes selected from a group consisting of the translation initiation factor eIF4E gene or the gene homologous thereto, the receptor-like kinase RLK gene or the gene homologous thereto, the coatomer complex deltaCOP gene or the gene homologous thereto, and the nuclear shuttle protein interactor NSI gene or the gene homologous thereto.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Further, when the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants of the present embodiment have a mutation in the eIF4E gene, the plants may have mutations in all of the genes each encoding the eIF4E protein which is functional for TYLCV. For example, in the case of<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> diploid plants, such as amphidiploid plants, each of the plurality of genes encoding the eIF4E protein functional for TYLCV preferably has a mutation therein. As long as the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants have a mutation in a gene encoding the eIF4E protein functional for TYLCV, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants may have other normal eIF4E gene(s). Further, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants may be plants in which endogenous gene(s) encoding the eIF4E protein functional for TYLCV have been made non-functional due to complete loss, damage or the like, but instead, containing an introduced exogenous eIF4E gene.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">The same applies to the case where a TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants have the mutation in the RLK gene, deltaCOP gene, and/or NSI gene. In other words, all of the genes encoding any one of the proteins which are functional for TYLCV may have the mutation and, preferably, all of the genes encoding the proteins functional for TYLCV have the mutation. As long as such TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants have a mutation in a gene encoding any one of the proteins which are functional for TYLCV, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants may have other normal gene(s). Further, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants may be plants in which the endogenous gene(s) encoding the protein functional for TYLCV have been made unfunctional due to complete loss, damage or the like, but instead, containing an introduced exogenous homologous gene(s).</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">In one aspect of the present embodiment, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants have a mutation in their genomic gene. Specific examples of such a gene mutation include mutations (a) to (d) below:

<li>(b) The nonsense mutation is a mutation where a codon intrinsically encoding an amino acid is changed to a termination codon, and due to this change, the mutated gene becomes a TYLCV resistance gene.</li>
<li>(c) The loss of continuous or non-continuous 3n nucleotides (wherein n = 1 to 7, preferably n = 1 to 3, for example, the 3n nucleotides are 3, 6 or 9 nucleotides) results in a change in the amino acid sequence encoded downstream of this lost region. Due to the occurrence of such a change, the mutated gene becomes a TYLCV resistance gene.</li>
<li>(d) The replacement, deletion, addition, and/or insertion of 1 or more nucleotides results in a change in a reading frame of an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence downstream of the mutated region. The change in the reading frame results in a change in intrinsically encoded amino acid sequence, and this causes a conformational change and the like of the encoded protein and the mutated gene becomes a TYLCV resistance gene. In one aspect, this mutation is preferably a mutation of a nucleotide other than the 3rd nucleotide of a codon. There is no particular limitation on the number of replaced, deleted, added, and/or inserted nucleotides as long as the TYLCV resistance gene is obtained.

</ul></p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">Firstly, a target gene for introducing a mutation is selected. At least one gene is selected from the group consisting of the translation initiation factor eIF4E gene and a gene homologous thereto, the receptor-like kinase RLK gene and a gene homologous thereto, the coatomer complex deltaCOP gene and a gene homologous thereto, and the nuclear shuttle protein interactor NSI gene and a gene homologous thereto. The selected gene may be single gene or a combination of two or more genes. Details of the genes are the same as those explained above in connection with the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants.</p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Secondly, a mutation is introduced into the selected gene. Methods for introducing a mutation into a genomic gene can be broadly classified into two methods<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> exemplified below.
<ol id="ol0007" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(1) Direct genome editing: A method in which a plant carrying a TYLCV resistance gene is produced by directly editing a plant genome carrying the eIF4E, RLK, deltaCOP or NSI gene functional for TYLCV to introduce a mutation into a desired site at a pin point.</li>
<li>(2) Introduction of mutated gene: A method which combines the following steps (A) and (B): (A) TYLCV resistance gene is produced, and introduced into a plant by using an appropriate promotor; and (B) among endogenous genes of a plant which correspond to the TYLCV resistance gene produced in step (A) above, a gene functional for TYLCV is changed into a gene non-functional for TYLCV.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">Each method is explained below.</p>
<heading id="h0021">(1) Direct genome editing</heading>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">Direct genome editing can be performed using conventional genome editing techniques which use a site specific nuclease, such as CRISPR, TALEN or the like. When a double strand cleavage is introduced using a restriction enzyme capable of cleaving a specific site in a genome, various mutations are introduced at the time of repair due to a repair error. As a result, a mutation is introduced into a target gene (in the present embodiment, a gene encoding eIF4E, RLK, deltaCOP or NSI functional for TYLCV).</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">Preferably a CRISPR system, and more preferably a CRISPR/Cas9 system is used since these systems are capable of introducing mutation at high specificity and high efficiency. In the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a guide RNA (sgRNA) which has a sequence of about 20 nucleotides long and which is homologous to the target gene recognizes the target and Cas9 protein cleaves the double strand. During the repair of the resultant cleavage by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair cycle, a mutation is introduced into the target site due to a repair error.</p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">Delivery of the Cas protein and sgRNA to a plant may be performed via a vector encoding the same by using methods well-known to those skilled in the art, such as an<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> agrobacterium method, a standard transfection, electroporation, particle bombardment and the like.</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">Briefly, as explained in Examples hereinbelow, the Cas protein and sgRNA are delivered to plants by constructing a binary vector with incorporated Cas gene and sgRNA, and transforming agrobacterium with the constructed vector, followed by transformation of plants with the agrobacterium (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="b"><text>Friedrich Fuser et al., "The Plant Journal," 2014, 79: 348-359</text></nplcit>; and <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="b"><text>Ryo Oosawa and Hiroshi Ezura, "Atarashii Shokubutu Ikushu Gijyutu wo Rikaisiyou - NBT (New plant breeding techniques) (Understanding New Plant Breeding Techniques - NBT (New plant breeding techniques))", International Academic Publishing Co., Ltd., 2013</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">There is no particular limitation on the form of the plants being transformed with the agrobacterium, as long as the plant is capable of reproducing a plant body. Examples of such plant forms include a suspension culture, protoplast, leaf section, callus and the like. After removing the agrobacterium, the transfected plants can be cultured in a medium containing a drug selected in accordance with the vector used, and a selection culture of a plant (section) having an incorporated desired gene may be performed based on drug resistance.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">The guide RNA may be designed to enable a highly efficient introduction of a mutation into a target site. In general, a site 3 nucleotides upstream of a 3-nucleotide sequence called a PAM sequence (which is NGG for the most popular Cas9 derived from S. pyogenes) is basically cleaved in a CRISPR system. Since the PAM sequence must exist immediately after the target sequence, the guide RNA may be designed so that the target sequence is located upstream of the PAM sequence.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">When designing the guide RNA, GC content is preferably taken into consideration because higher the GC content, the higher is the the cleavage efficiency. Further, the system may be designed to minimize non-specific cleavage by an off-target effect. In one aspect,<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> when the plant is tomato, the guide RNA is preferably designed to have a nucleotide sequence which targets a specific sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3) in exon 2 of chromosome 3 and/or a specific sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:6) in exon 1 of chromosome 2.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">For example, in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> which illustrates the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) of the eIF4E gene present on chromosome 3 of a tomato, the guide RNA may be designed so that the PAM sequence is the boxed portion in exon 2 (underlined portion of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>; SEQ ID NO:2) and the target is generally 20 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:3) located upstream of the boxed 3 nucleotides. The direct genome editing of other solanaceous plants can be performed in the same manner as in tomatoes, by selecting a target from a region in a gene homologous to the eIF4E gene which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:3 and, then, selecting the PAM sequence and designing the guide RNA. Plants having TYLCV resistant eIF4E gene can be produced by introducing a mutation to the target site into the above-mentioned manner.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">In <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> which illustrates the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) of the RLK gene present on chromosome 2 of a tomato, the guide RNA may be designed so that the PAM sequence is the boxed portion in exon 1 (underlined portion of <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>; SEQ ID NO:5) and the target is generally 20 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:6) located upstream of the boxed 3 nucleotides.

Plants having TYLCV resistant RLK gene can be produced by introducing a mutation into the target site in the above-mentioned manner.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">In <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 13</figref> which illustrates the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:33) of the deltaCOP gene present on chromosome 1 (i.e., delta01 gene) of a tomato, the guide RNA may be designed so that the PAM sequence is the boxed portion in exon 6 (underlined portion of<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 13</figref>; SEQ ID NO:34) and the target is generally 20 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:35) located upstream of the boxed 3 nucleotides. The direct genome editing of other solanaceous plants can be performed in the same manner as in tomatoes, that is, selecting a target from a region in a gene homologous to the delta01 gene which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:35 and, then, selecting the PAM sequence and designing the guide RNA. Plants having TYLCV resistant deltaCOP gene can be produced by introducing a mutation into the target site in the above-mentioned manner.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">In <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 14</figref> which illustrates the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:36) of the deltaCOP gene present on chromosome 10 (i.e., delta10 gene) of a tomato, similarly, the guide RNA may be designed so that the PAM sequence is the boxed portion in exon 2 (underlined portion of <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 14</figref>; SEQ ID NO:37) and the target is generally 20 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:38) located upstream of the boxed 3 nucleotides. The direct genome editing of other solanaceous plants can be performed in the same manner as in tomatoes, by selecting a target from a region in a gene homologous to the delta10 gene which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:38 and, then, selecting the PAM sequence and designing the guide RNA. Plants having TYLCV resistant deltaCOP gene can be produced by introducing a mutation into the target site in the above-mentioned manner.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">In <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 15</figref> which illustrates the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:39) of the NSI gene present on chromosome 10 of a tomato, the guide RNA may be designed so that the PAM sequence is the boxed portion in exon 4 (underlined portion of <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 15</figref>; SEQ ID NO:40) and the target is generally 20 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:41) located upstream of the boxed 3 nucleotides.

Plants having TYLCV resistant NSI gene can be produced by introducing a mutation into the target site in the above-mentioned<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> manner.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">When a double strand cleavage is introduced into a single site by the CRISPR system, about 20 nucleotides are repaired and a mutation is considered to be introduced by the repair error. Therefore, in one aspect, the mutation in the TYLCV resistance gene of the present embodiment is a mutation of continuous or non-continuous 3n nucleotides (wherein n = 1 to 7, preferably n = 1 to 3).</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">Further, the present embodiment relates to the guide RNAs and vectors comprising the guide RNA which are used for producing the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plant. The sequences of the guide RNAs are as mentioned above. The present embodiment also relates to kits comprising the guide RNA. The kits may comprise a site specific nuclease and the like which are necessary for genome editing using the CRISPR system, and the kit may be used for producing the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants.</p>
<heading id="h0022">(2) Introduction of mutated gene</heading>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">Introduction of mutated gene is a method which combines the following steps (A) and (B).
<ol id="ol0008" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(A) TYLCV resistance gene is produced, and introduced into a plant by using an appropriate promotor; and</li>
<li>(B) among endogenous genes of a plant which correspond to the TYLCV resistance gene produced in step (A) above, a gene functional for TYLCV is changed into a gene non-functional for TYLCV.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">There is no particular limitation on the order for performing the above steps (A) and (B) as long as the steps cause no fatal damage to the plants, and step (B) may be performed before step (A). It should be noted that a method which performs step (B) alone at a specific part of the plant is the method (1) Direct Genome Editing.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">In step (A), a mutated gene encoding eIF4E protein non-functional for TYLCV, a mutated gene encoding RLK protein non-functional for TYLCV, a mutated gene encoding<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> deltaCOP protein non-functional for TYLCV, and/or a mutated gene encoding NSI protein non-functional for TYLCV is/are produced, and introduced into plants using an appropriate promotor. Production of the mutated gene may be performed by conventional methods well-known in the art. For example, a nucleotide sequence having a desired mutation may be synthesized and amplified by PCR, etc. The mutations introduced herein are the same as those explained above in connection with the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">Introduction of the produced mutated gene into plants may be also performed by conventional methods well-known in the art. In brief, the introduction may be performed using a vector containing the mutated gene, for example by a polyethylene glycol method, electroporation, agrobacterium method, particle gun method and the like. The mutated gene introduced herein is the TYLCV resistance gene obtained by introducing a mutation into the eIF4E gene (or the gene homologous thereto), RLK gene (or the gene homologous thereto), deltaCOP gene (or the gene homologous thereto) and/or NSI gene (or the gene homologous thereto) derived from a solanaceous plant, and the TYLCV resistance gene can be derived from solanaceous plants of different species.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">There is no particular limitation on the form of the plants used for introduce the above-mentioned vector, as long as the plant is capable of reproducing a plant body. Examples of such plant forms include a suspension culture, protoplast, leaf section, callus and the like.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">Next, in step (B), among the endogenous eIF4E gene (or the gene homologous thereto), RLK gene (or the gene homologous thereto), deltaCOP gene (or the gene homologous thereto)and/or NSI gene (or the gene homologous thereto) of the plant, a gene which is functional for TYLCV is changed into a gene which is non-functional for TYLCV. Step (B) may be performed using conventional methods which are used for introducing mutation into plants. Examples of such methods include treatments with a mutagen, such as ion beam or EMS. Step (B) may be performed using the above-mentioned genome<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> editing techniques, such as CRISPR and TALEN. Desirably, all of the genes functional for TYLCV among the endogenous eIF4E, RLK, deltaCOP and/or NSI are changed into a state which is non-functional for TYLCV.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">Subsequently, a plant body is reproduced from the parts (such as, leaf sections or plant cells) of the plant carrying the TYLCV resistance gene. Reproduction of the plant body may be performed by well-known conventional methods in accordance with the type of the plant. For example, reproduction may be performed by making reference to <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Sun H.J. et al., "Plant Cell Physiol.," 2006, 47: 426 </text></nplcit>and the like for tomatoes, and <nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Jefferson R.A. et al., "EMBO J.," 1987, 6: 3901 </text></nplcit>and the like for tobaccos.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">Further, solanaceous plants having resistance against TYLCV are selected from the reproduced plants. Such a selection may be performed by the above-mentioned methods for confirming TYLCV resistance. For example, plants having TYLCV resistance may be selected by infecting the plants with TYLCV using a routine procedure, and determining the amount of accumulated TYLCV in the plants by conventional methods, such as ELISA, PCR and the like. Alternatively, solanaceous plants having TYLCV resistance may be selected by determining the presence or absence of TYLCV infection symptoms (mosaic pattern and yellowing of leaves, fern leaves, dwarfing, necrosis, etc.) in the TYLCV infected plants.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">The solanaceous plants produced by the above-mentioned methods include tomato, eggplant, tobaco, hot pepper, potato and the like, preferably tomato, eggplant, and potato, and more preferably tomato.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">In one aspect, the present embodiment relates to solanaceous plants produced by the above-mentioned method. Such solanaceous plants are the same as the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants explained above.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">Once the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants carrying the TYLCV resistance gene are obtained, progenies and clones of such plants may be obtained by conventional methods. Therefore, the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plants of the present embodiment include such<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> progenies and clones.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">In one aspect, the present embodiment relates to a method for producing a bred progeny of the TYLCV resistant solanaceous plant, comprising: self-pollination or cross-pollination of TYLCV resistant solanaceous plant (first generation) or its progeny. The self-pollination or cross-pollination of a plant can be performed by any conventional methods well-known in the art, and can be performed under either natural or artificial conditions. The progeny obtained in this manner may be subjected to self-pollination or cross-pollination to produce a further progeny.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">A solanaceous plant used to crossbreed with the first generation or later progeny by cross-pollination may be a solanaceous plant having either the same mutation in the same gene, a different mutation in the same gene, or a mutation in a different gene. For example, it is possible to crossbreed 2 different plants selected from a plant having mutation in the eIF4E gene, a plant having mutation in the RLK gene, a plant having mutation in the deltaCOP gene, and a plant having mutation in the NSI gene. It is also possible to perform breeding several times to produce a plant carrying mutation in 3 or more genes.</p>

<heading id="h0039">Test for confirming TYLCV resistance of eIF4E mutated tomato</heading>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">In nature, TYLCV is transmitted by an insect vector which is silverleaf whitefly and, therefore, plants are not infected by a mechanical inoculation using a juice of an infected leaf. Viral infectious clone inoculation method using an agrobacterium was employed for efficiently infecting a plurality of samples with TYLCV. In this method, similarly to the method for gene recombination, an agrobacterium binary vector having the whole TYLCV sequence incorporated therein (infectious clone) is produced, and an agrobacterium is transformed with the produced clone. The resultant recombinant agrobacterium is cultured in a liquid medium. Then, the medium is replaced with 0.01M MES buffer (pH 5.7 and the agrobacterium is inoculated by injection or the like to plant bodies (i.e., tomato in this experiment) at their growing points, relatively young stems, or petioles, so that the cells in the vicinity of the injected parts become infected by the agrobacterium. When the infected agrobacterium introduces TYLCV DNA into the plant genome, the TYLCV DNA introduced into the plant genome is expressed by the NOS promoter and the like designed in the binary vector. As a result, virus is produced and infection is established. Such infectious clone inoculation was used as a mock inoculation because TYLCV in nature also replicates inside the nucleus of a plant cell.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">Plants (T0) of eIF4E gene-edited line were grown in an isolated green house and were self-pollinated for collecting seeds. The seeds which are transgenic progeny (T1) are sown and grown. The thus obtained seedlings were inoculated with infectious clone of TYLCV-Israel strain by the above-mentioned test for confirming TYLCV resistance. A<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> wild type variety free of introduced mutation was also tested as a control.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">As a result, in several plants, such as plant A132-4 which is a T1 plant of the eIF4E gene-edited line, symptoms of virus infections (such as mosaic pattern and yellowing of leaves, fern leaves, dwarfing, necrosis, etc.) were not observed even after 20 days from virus inoculation. <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows A132-4 plant ((a) of the Figure) and a control wild type tomato plant ((b) of the Figure), both on day 42 from virus inoculation. In the control, leaves were deformed by curling downward. Further, the presence or absence of infection symptoms were visually observed on day 25 from the virus infection. Morbidity was defined as a proportion of the number of plants which are defined positive based on symptoms and PCR, relative to the number of tested plants (number of samples). The morbidity of the control was about 0.9 and the morbidity of the eIF4E-edited line A132 was as low as 0.6 (see <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>). The test method used herein is a method with much higher infection pressure than a virus infection in nature by an insect vector. Therefore, the morbidity of 0.6 in the present test is suspected to be a level which causes no virus infection in nature.</p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">Next, DNA was extracted from leaves of plants without any symptoms and subjected to PCR analysis using TYLCV detection primer 5 (CCCTCTGGAATGAAGGAACA, SEQ ID NO: 11) and primer 6 (TTGAAAAATTGGRCTCTCAA, SEQ ID NO: 12). As a result, the virus was detected by PCR from one plant (A132-8) of the eIF4E-eddited line without any symptoms. However, no virus was detected from the remaining tested plants (eIF4E-edited lines A132-2, A132-4, A132-9 and A132-10) (see <figref idref="f0004">FIG.5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">In addition, seeds were collected from the plant A132-10 which is a T1 generation plant of the eIF4E-eddited line showing virus resistance. The seeds were sown and grown. The thus obtained seedlings (corresponding to the T2 generation) were inoculated with infectious TYLCV clone. S8 plants before the introduction of mutation were used as controls. The morbidity was determined on day 22 from the virus infection based on the<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> presence or absence of symptoms. There was a clear difference in morbidity between the control and the gene edited line such that the morbidity of the control was 0.9% or more, while that of the eIF4E-edited line A132-10 was less than 0.6. When DNA was extracted from leaves of plants without any symptoms and subjected to PCR analysis in the above-mentioned manner, virus was detected from one plant without any symptoms. The number of plants in which virus infection has been confirmed by PCR and the number of plants in which symptoms have been confirmed by visual inspection were summed together, and the proportion of this sum to the number of samples were calculated as morbidity after the PCR analysis. The morbidity for eIF4E-eddited line became about 0.7, but this value is much lower than that of the control (see <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>). These results confirmed that TYLCV resistance is being inherited by the mutation introduced into the eIF4E gene.</p>
