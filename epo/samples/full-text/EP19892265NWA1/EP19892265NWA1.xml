<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to field of optical imaging, in particular to a photosensitive assembly, a camera module, a method for manufacturing the camera module, and an electronic device.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, smart devices, such as smart phones, have become increasingly lighter, thinner, and more high-performance. This development trend of smart devices has raised more demanding requirements for the size and imaging capabilities of the camera module, which is one of the standard configurations of smart devices.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In terms of hardware, the imaging capability of the camera module depends on the number and size of the electronic components in the circuit and the parameters of the photosensitive chip, for example, the size of the photosensitive surface of the photosensitive chip. In other words, the number and size of electronic components and the parameters of the photosensitive chip are the basis for improving the imaging capability of the camera module. However, the existing technology for packaging camera modules has greatly increased the size of camera modules with a greater number and higher size of electronic components and photosensitive chips with better parameters, as a result, the development trend of the size of the high-performance camera modules is contrary to the development trend of the smart devices.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a typical camera module in the prior art, which includes a circuit board 1P, a set of electronic components 2P, a photosensitive chip 3P, a lens holder 4P, a light filter 5P, a lens bearing portion 6P, and a lens unit 7P. Firstly, a set of the electronic components 2P are mounted on the circuit board 1P at intervals; secondly, the photosensitive chip 3P is mounted on the circuit board 1P, and the photosensitive chip 3P is conductively connected to the circuit board 1P through at least one set of gold wires 8P, wherein a set of the electronic components 2P surrounds the photosensitive chip 3P; thirdly, the lens holder 4P is mounted on the circuit board 1P by surrounding the photosensitive chip 3P, and a light filter bearing arm 41P of the lens holder 4P protrudes from an inner wall of the lens holder 4P, so as to extend toward the direction of the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 3P; fourthly, the light filter 5P is mounted on the light<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> filter bearing arm 41P of the lens holder 4P, so as to maintain the light filter 5P in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 3P; fifthly, the lens unit 7P is arranged on the lens bearing portion 6P, and the lens bearing portion 6P is mounted on the lens holder 4P, so as to maintain the lens unit 7P in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 3P. In the camera module of the prior art, the light filter 5P needs to be carried by the light filter bearing arm 41P of the lens holder 4P. Therefore, the lens holder 4P must be designed to have a structure of the light filter bearing arm 41P, and this causes the lens holder 4P to occupy more height space, so that it is difficult to reduce the size in height of the camera module. In addition, in order to prevent the light filter bearing arm 41P of the lens holder 4P from contacting with the electronic component 2P, a space needs to be reserved between the light filter bearing arm 41P and the electronic component 2P, this also makes it difficult to reduce the size in height of the camera module.</p>

<p id="p0071" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 2-8</figref> of the accompanying drawings of the specification of the present invention, a camera module 1000 according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention is disclosed and explained in the following description, wherein the camera module 1000 includes a circuit board assembly 10, a bonding portion 20, a light filter 30, and an optical lens unit 40.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the circuit board assembly 10 includes a circuit board 11 and a set of electronic components 12 conductively connected to the circuit board 11, and there is a gap between the adjacent electronic components 12. The manner of conductively connecting the electronic component 12 to the circuit board 11 is not limited. For example, in the specific example of the camera module 1000 shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the electronic component 12 is conductively connected to<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the circuit board 11 by being mounted on the surface of the circuit board 11. Optionally, the electronic component 12 is conductively connected to the circuit board 11 in such a manner that at least a part of it is embedded inside of the circuit board 11.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">Further referring to <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the circuit board assembly 10 further includes a photosensitive chip 13, which has a photosensitive area 131 and a non-sensitive area 132 surrounding the photosensitive area 131, wherein the photosensitive chip 13 is conductively connected to the circuit board 11. The manner of conductively connecting the photosensitive chip 13 to the circuit board 11 is not limited. For example, in the specific example of the camera module 1000 shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the photosensitive chip 13 is mounted on the surface of the circuit board 11, and two ends of at least one set of guiding wires 14 formed by a wire bonding process are conductively connected to the photosensitive chip 13 and the circuit board 11, respectively, so that the photosensitive chip 13 is conductively connected to the circuit board 11. Optionally, the photosensitive chip 13 is mounted on the circuit board 11 and conductively connected to the circuit board 11 by a flip-chip process.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">Particularly, in the camera module 1000 shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, a set of the electronic components 12 form two rows of the electronic components 12, wherein one row of the electronic components 12 are located on the left side of the photosensitive chip 13, another row of the electronic components 12 are located on the right side of the photosensitive chip 13. Optionally, a set of the electronic components 12 form three rows of the electronic components 12, wherein the three rows of the electronic components 12 are respectively located on three sides of the photosensitive chip 13. Optionally, a set of the electronic components 12 form four rows of the electronic components 12, wherein the four rows of the electronic components 12 are located on four sides of the photosensitive chip 13. Optionally, more than two rows of the electronic components 12 may also be arranged on a same side of the photosensitive chip 13. Therefore, the relative arrangement of the electronic components 12 and the photosensitive chip 13 shown in <figref idref="f0002 f0003">Figs. 2-7</figref> are only for reference, and should not be regarded as a limitation to the content and scope of the camera module 1000 of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">The bonding portion 20 is ring-shaped and has a lower bonding side 21, a top bonding surface 22 corresponding to the lower bonding side 21, and a light path 23 extending from the top bonding surface 22 to the lower bonding side 21. The lower bonding side 21 of the bonding portion 20 is bonded to the circuit board assembly 10, and the bonding portion 20 surrounds the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13; a plane on which the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> portion 20 is located is higher than a plane on which the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13 is located, and the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13 corresponds to the light path 23 of the bonding portion 20. Periphery of the light filter 30 is bonded to the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding portion 20, so that the light filter 30 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13. The optical lens unit 40 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13. In this preferred example of the camera module 1000 of the present invention shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the bonding portion 20 is in a shape of a square ring, i.e., the bonding portion 20 has four sides 24, wherein two adjacent sides 24 are connected end to end and perpendicular to each other, so that the light path 23 is formed between the bonding portions 20 formed by the four sides 24. Each side 24 of the bonding portion 20 is respectively located outside the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Preferably, the lower bonding side 21 of the bonding portion 20 is bonded to the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, and the bonding portion 20 extends upward from the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13 to a suitable height, and forms the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding portion 20; and the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding portion 20 corresponds to the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13; in this way, a flatness of the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding portion 20 may be ensured by the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, thereby ensuring the flatness between the light filter 30 and the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">A distance size (parameter H) between the plane on which the top bonding surface 22 of the bonding portion 20 is located and the plane on which the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13 is located is greater than or equal to 0.15 mm. In this way, it is beneficial for reducing generation of stray light and imaging of dirty spots, thereby improving the imaging quality of the camera module 1000.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">A width size (parameter W) of the side 24 of the bonding portion 20 is greater than or equal to 0.15mm. In this way, packaging tolerances may be compensated, so that the light filter 30 is reliably supported in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by the bonding portion 20.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">In the present invention, the circuit board assembly 10, the bonding portion 20, and the light filter 30 form a photosensitive assembly, i.e., the camera module 1000 includes the photosensitive assembly and the optical lens unit 40 which is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13, and the light entering the inside of the camera module 1000 from the optical lens unit 40<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> may be received by the photosensitive chip 13 and photo-electrically converted.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">Further to refer to <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the camera module 1000 further includes a lens holder 50 and a lens bearing portion 60 mounted on the lens holder 50. The lens holder 50 has a lower surface 51, an upper surface 52 corresponding to the lower surface 51, and an inner surface 53 extending from the upper surface 52 to the lower surface 51. The lower surface 51 of the lens holder 50 is integrally bonded to the circuit board 11 and the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, and the inner surface 53 of the lens holder 50 is integrally bonded to the bonding portion 20. The optical lens unit 40 is arranged on the lens bearing portion 60, and the lens bearing portion 60 has a mounting surface 61, wherein the lens bearing portion 60 is mounted on the lens holder 50 in such a manner that the mounting surface 61 of the lens bearing portion 60 is mounted on the upper surface 52 of the lens holder 50, so that the optical lens unit 40 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by the lens holder 50 and the lens bearing portion 60.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">The type of the lens bearing portion 60 is selected according to the type of the camera module 1000. For example, when the camera module 1000 is a fixed-focus camera module, the lens bearing portion 60 is selected as a lens barrel. Correspondingly, when the camera module 1000 is a zoom camera module, the lens bearing portion 60 is selected as a motor, such as but not limited to a voice coil motor.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 7</figref>, preferably, a parameter of a distance between the mounting surface 61 of the lens bearing portion 60 and the lower surface of the light filter 30 is set as D, and a range of value of the parameter D is 0.1-0.2mm (including 0.1mm and 0.2mm) to help reduce the size in height of the camera module 1000. It is worth mentioning that, in the camera module 1000 of the present invention, the light filter 30 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by the bonding portion 20, and the lens bearing portion 60 is mounted on the lens holder 50, so that compared to the camera module in prior art, in this preferred example of the camera module 1000 of the present invention, the distance between the mounting surface 61 of the lens bearing portion 60 and the lower surfaces of the light filter 30 may be smaller, which is particularly important for reducing the size in height of the camera module 1000.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">Further referring to <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 7</figref>, in this preferred example of the camera module 1000 according to the present invention, the light filter 30 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by the bonding portion 20, and the lens bearing portion 60 is mounted on the lens holder 50 so that the optical lens unit 40 is kept in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> lens bearing portion 60 and the lens holder 50. Since the lens holder 50 does not need to keep the light filter 30 in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13, a height of the upper surface 52 of the lens holder 50 (the distance from the upper surface 52 to the photosensitive chip 13) may be reduced, thereby reducing a distance between the optical lens unit 40 and the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13. In this way, a back focus size of the camera module 1000 may be reduced, thereby facilitating to reduce the size in height of the camera module 1000. The back focal length of the camera module 1000 refers to a distance between a surface of a lens of the optical lens unit 40 which is closest to the photosensitive chip 13 and the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13. A parameter of the back focal length of the camera module 1000 is set as L, wherein a range of value of the parameter L is 0.4-0.6mm (including 0.4mm and 0.6mm), as compared with the back focal length of 0.8mm in the camera module of prior art, the back focal length of the camera module 1000 according to the present invention may be reduced by a large value, thereby facilitating to reduce the size in height of the camera module 1000.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">Optionally, in an example of the camera module 1000, the lens bearing portion 60 and the lens holder 50 may be an integrated structure. In another example of the camera module 1000, the camera module 1000 may not be configured with the lens bearing portion 60. In this case, the camera module 1000 keeps the optical lens unit 40 in the photosensitive path of the photosensitive chip 13 by directly mounting the optical lens unit 40 on the lens holder 50.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">In the camera module 1000 shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004">Figs. 7-8</figref>, the lens holder 50 is not prefabricated, wherein the lens holder 50 may be integrally formed by a molding process and bonded to the circuit board assembly 10 and the bonding portion 20, thereby allowing the lower surface 51 of the lens holder 50 to be integrally bonded to the circuit board 11 and the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, and allowing the inner surface 53 of the lens holder 50 to be integrally bonded to the bonding portion 20. In this way, the reliability for bonding the lens holder 50 to the circuit board 11, the photosensitive chip 13, and the bonding portion 20 is higher, thereby facilitating to ensure the stability and reliability of the camera module 1000. Optionally, the lens holder 50 may be further integrally bonded to the peripheral edges of the light filter 30.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">The camera module 1000 adopts a manner in which the lens holder 50 is integrally bonded to the circuit board 11 and the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, so that the packaging process of the camera module 1000 no longer requires the lens holder 50 to be prefabricated, thereby facilitating to reduce the cost and risk of the management and control of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> components of the camera module 1000.</p>

The type of the electronic component 12 is not limited in the camera module 1000 according to the present invention. For example, the electronic component 12 may be, but not limited to, a resistor, a capacitor, a controller, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">Referring to <figref idref="f0010">Fig. 15</figref>, the photosensitive chip 13 is mounted on the circuit board 11, and at least one set of guiding wires 14 with the two ends being conductively connected to the photosensitive chip 13 and the circuit board 11 respectively are formed by a wire bonding process, so as to form the circuit board assembly 10.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">It is worth mentioning that, the stage shown in <figref idref="f0010">Fig. 15</figref> may be prior to the stage shown in <figref idref="f0010">Fig. 14</figref>, i.e., firstly the photosensitive chip 13 is mounted on the circuit board 11, and then a set of the electronic components 12 are mounted on the circuit board 11 to form the circuit board assembly 10.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="f0010">Fig. 16</figref>, a glue material 400 is applied to the circuit board assembly 10 so that the glue material 400 covers the electronic components 12. Preferably, the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 further extends inward to and wraps the non-photosensitive area 132 of the photosensitive chip 13, and extends outward to and wraps the circuit board 11; and the glue material 400 covers the guiding wires 14. More preferably, the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 has a ring shape, such as a square ring shape, which surrounds the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13. In this preferred example of the camera module 1000 shown in <figref idref="f0011 f0012">Figs. 19-20</figref>, the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 covers the highest electronic component 12.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">It is worth mentioning that the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 is the glue material 400 with a relatively high viscosity, so as to avoid an undesirable phenomenon, i.e. prevent the glue material 400 from flowing after being applied to the circuit board assembly 10, thereby avoiding contamination of the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13 during the process of packaging the camera module 1000.</p>

When the light filter 30 is mounted on the top of the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10, a force is applied to the light filter 30 in a direction where the photosensitive chip 13 is located, so that a flat surface is formed on the top of the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10, and the light filter 30 and the photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13 are kept flat. Since the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 is the glue material 400 with a relatively high viscosity, after the light filter 30 is mounted on the top of the glue material 400 applied to the circuit board assembly 10 and the external force applied to the light filter 30 is removed, the relative positions of the light filter 30 and the photosensitive chip 13 will not change.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">Optionally, in other examples of the camera module 1000 of the present invention, the glue material 400 may be applied along a extending direction of the electronic components 12, for example, if the electronic components 12 of the camera module 1000 are in three rows; at this time, the glue material 400 is not applied into a state of surrounding the non-photosensitive area 131 of the photosensitive chip 13, i.e., the glue material 400 is also not applied on a side of the photosensitive chip 13 where the electronic components 12 are not arranged. After the photosensitive chip 30 is mounted on the top of the glue material 400, a gap will be formed between the light filter 30 and the circuit board assembly 10, and then the gap formed between the light filter 30 and the circuit board assembly 10 may be sealed by replenishing glue or the like.</p>
