<heading id="h0001">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor used in producing an alkenyl acetate, such as allyl acetate and vinyl acetate, from a lower olefin, acetic acid and oxygen by a gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Allyl acetate is one of the important industrial raw materials used for manufacturing raw materials, such as solvents and allyl alcohol.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">As a method for producing allyl acetate, there is a method in which propylene, acetic acid and oxygen are used as raw materials, and a gas phase reaction or a liquid phase reaction is used. As a catalyst used in this reaction, a catalyst in which palladium is used as a main catalyst component and an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound is used as a cocatalyst, and these are supported on a carrier is known and widely used. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH291045A"><text>JP H2-91045 A</text></patcit> (Patent Literature 1) describes a method for producing allyl acetate using a catalyst in which palladium, potassium acetate, and copper are supported on a carrier.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, vinyl acetate is an important industrial material used in a variety of fields, such as a paint, an adhesive, and a fiber treatment agent, as a raw material of a vinyl acetate resin, a raw material of polyvinyl alcohol, or a monomer for copolymerization with ethylene, styrene, an acrylate, or a methacrylate.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">As a method for producing vinyl acetate, there is a method in which ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen are used as raw materials, and a gas phase reaction or a liquid phase reaction is used. As a catalyst used in this reaction, a catalyst in which palladium is used as a main catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> component and an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound is supported on a carrier as a cocatalyst is known and widely used. For example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2004526553A"><text>JP 2004-526553 A</text></patcit> (Patent Literature 2) describes a method for producing vinyl acetate using a catalyst in which palladium, gold, and potassium acetate are supported on a carrier.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In the production process of an alkenyl acetate using the aforementioned catalyst, Patent Literature 1 and Series "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Catalysts and Economy", Vol. 35, No. 7 (1993), pp. 467-470</text></nplcit> (Non-Patent Literature 1) describe that it is necessary to continuously supply potassium acetate to the catalyst, since small amounts of potassium acetate leak out of the catalysts filled in the reaction tube during a process operation of a continuous reaction for a long period of time over several thousand hours in a unit.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">As a reactor applied to the production of alkenyl acetate, a fixed-bed tubular reactor is generally used. A fixed-bed tubular reactor is one in which a catalyst (supported on a carrier) as a fixed-bed is filled in a reaction tube. A fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor is one having a plurality of reaction tubes among fixed-bed tubular reactors. A reaction substrate is supplied to the reaction tube in a gas phase state, and reacts in the catalyst layer, and a reaction product is discharged from the reaction tube. As the reaction tube, a straight reaction tube is often used from the viewpoint of equipment manufacturing, equipment maintenance, workability at the time of filling and replacing the catalyst, removal of reaction heat, etc. In many cases, the reaction tube is installed in a vertical direction from the viewpoint of workability of filling and extracting the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In general, in order to observe the reaction state in the catalyst layer during the operation of an industrial manufacturing process, the catalyst layer temperatures of these reactors are monitored. A method for measuring a catalyst layer temperature includes, for example, as described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002212127A"><text>JP 2002-212127 A</text></patcit> (Patent Literature 3), a method for measuring temperatures of reaction tubes in the longitudinal direction in which protection tubes (sheaths) are placed in several reaction tubes representing the entirety of the fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor before filling the catalyst, and thermocouples are inserted in these protection tubes.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Since the gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction is an exothermic reaction, a heat medium for heat removal is generally supplied to the outsides of the reaction tubes. By monitoring the temperature difference between the heat medium temperature outside the reaction tubes (shell temperature) and the catalyst layer temperatures, it is possible to observe how much reaction substrate is reacting at which position in the longitudinal direction of the catalyst layer. When<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> uneven temperature distribution occurs, the plant can be operated so that the gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction proceeds stably and efficiently by controlling the reaction based on the uneven temperature distribution.</p>

<heading id="h0006">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h0007">[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]</heading>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">A thermocouple inserted into the reaction tube of the fixed-bed tubular reactor as described above can accurately measure the catalyst layer temperature, when only a gas is provided as a process fluid. However, the present inventors have found that, when this temperature measurement method is applied to a fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor for producing an alkenyl acetate and a long-term continuous reaction over several months is carried out, even though the reaction proceeds in the entirety of the fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor to produce a target reaction product (which means that the catalyst layer temperature is higher than the heat medium temperature (shell temperature) of the shell side (region where the heat medium flows outside the reaction tube) during the continuous reaction, due to the generation of the reaction heat), in practice, no temperature difference is observed between the catalyst layer temperature and the shell temperature, so that the catalyst layer temperature representing the entirety of the fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor cannot be monitored.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">In view of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a reaction apparatus capable of correctly measuring a catalyst layer temperature inside a reaction tube, even when a process operation for a long period of time is carried out to produce an alkenyl acetate by a gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction of a lower olefin, acetic acid and oxygen using<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor.</p>
<heading id="h0008">[SOLUTION TO PROBLEM]</heading>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The present inventors have found that the above phenomenon is caused by the fact that a mist of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate supplied to a fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor for producing vinyl acetate and allyl acetate attaches to a thermometer protection tube which is inserted into a reactor, and then forms a liquid droplet, which flows down over the thermometer protection tube, and is selectively supplied to a reaction tube into which the thermometer protection tube is inserted, whereby the amount of an alkali metal acetate supported by a catalyst in the reaction tube into which the thermometer protection tube is inserted excessively increases, and as a result, a catalytic activity decreases. In the reaction tube in which a catalyst having reduced catalytic activity is filled as described above, i.e., in the reaction tube into which a thermocouple is inserted, the amount of generated reaction heat is small, so that the temperature difference between the catalyst layer temperature in the reaction tube and the shell temperature is small. On the other hand, since the reaction proceeds properly in reaction tubes into which no thermocouple is inserted, the catalyst layer temperatures in these reaction tubes are correspondingly higher than the shell temperature, but are not reflected in a measured value of the catalyst layer temperature of the plant. Therefore, it may not be possible to appropriately operate the plant.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">In view of the above, the present inventors have discovered that by providing a specific shield for preventing a liquid droplet of alkali metal acetate attached to a thermometer protection tube from being supplied to a reaction tube, into which the thermometer protection tube is inserted, over the thermometer protection tube, it is possible to prevent a liquid droplet of alkali metal acetate from being selectively supplied to the reaction tube into which the thermometer protection tube is inserted, thereby completing the present invention.</p>

<p id="p0019" num="0019">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments only.</p>
<heading id="h0012">&lt;Fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor&gt;</heading>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">A fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor for producing an alkenyl acetate according to one embodiment comprises a plurality of reaction tubes to which a raw material gas and a mist of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate are supplied from an upper part of the fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor and which each have an inlet opening and an upper plane, a thermometer protection tube inserted into at least one of the plurality of reaction tubes from the upper part of the fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor, a thermometer inserted into the thermometer protection tube, and a shield disposed above the reaction tube into which the thermometer protection tube is inserted and attached to the thermometer protection tube.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic longitudinal sectional view of a fixed-bed multi-tubular reactor (hereinafter referred to simply as a "reactor") according to one embodiment, and <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 1A</figref> is a top view of a plane A-A' of the reactor 1 of <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 1A</figref>, the reactor 1 includes a plurality of reaction tubes 2 each having an inlet opening 21 and an upper plane 22, a thermometer protection tube 3 inserted into at least one of the plurality of reaction tubes 2, a thermometer 4 inserted into the thermometer protection tube 3, and a shield 5 attached to the thermometer protection tube 3.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The inside of the reaction tube 2 is filled with a catalyst (supported on a carrier, not shown) as a fixed-bed. A reaction substrate is supplied as a raw material gas S in a gas phase from a raw material gas supply 9 located at an upper part of the reactor 1 through a supply line 8 to the reaction tube 2, and reacts in a catalyst layer to generate a reaction product R. After being discharged from the reaction tube 2, the reaction product R is collected in a reaction product discharge section 10 located at a lower part of the reactor 1 and discharged through an extraction line 11. The reaction tube 2 is preferably a straight tube from the viewpoint of equipment manufacturing, equipment maintenance, workability at the time of filling and replacing the catalyst, removal of reaction heat, etc. The reaction tube 2 is preferably installed in a vertical direction from the viewpoint of workability of filling and extracting the catalyst. The upper end<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and the lower end of the reaction tube 2 are fixed by an upper fixing plate 12 and a lower fixing plate 13, respectively.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Since the gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction for synthesizing an alkenyl acetate is an exothermic reaction, a system for removing reaction heat from the outside of the reaction tube 2 is required. Even though there are no particular limitations on the inner diameter, outer diameter, length, material, and reaction heat removal equipment of the reaction tube 2, and a reaction heat removal method, the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2 is preferably 10 to 40 mm, and the length thereof is preferably 1 to 8 m, from the viewpoint of removal efficiency of reaction heat, the balance between a heat exchange area and a pressure loss inside the reaction tube, etc. Due to the limitations in increasing the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2 in terms of removal of reaction heat, the reactor 1 is configured as a multi-tubular reactor including a plurality of reaction tubes 2. It is preferable that the number of the reaction tubes 2 be, for example, 1,000 to 20,000, from the viewpoint of ensuring a production volume. The material of the reaction tube is preferably SUS due to its excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The reactor 1 includes a cylindrical or rectangular cylindrical jacket 6 for cooling the reaction tubes 2 (or heating it at the start of the reaction). A heat medium introduction port 14 is provided above the lower fixing plate 13 on the side of the jacket 6, and a heat medium discharge port 15 is provided below the upper fixing plate 12 on the side of the jacket 6. A space defined by the jacket 6, the upper fixing plate 12, the lower fixing plate 13, and the outsides of the reaction tubes 2 is referred to as a shell SH. A heat medium HM for controlling the temperatures of the reaction tubes 2 is introduced from the heat medium introduction port 14, flows through the shell SH, and is discharged from the heat medium discharge port 15. The inside of the shell SH may be provided with one or more baffles for defining the flow direction of the heat medium HM to make the temperature distribution of the heat medium HM more uniform throughout the shell SH. The temperature of the heat medium HM flowing through the shell SH is measured by a shell thermometer 7. The shell thermometer 7 is preferably arranged so that a temperature measuring part thereof is located at the center of the reactor 1 (in the case of a cylindrical reactor, at the center of the cross-sectional circle and near the midpoint of the cylindrical height). The heat medium HM is preferably water (steam).</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In the reaction tube 2, the raw material gas S, and a mist of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate SA are supplied through the supply line 8.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The raw material gas S includes a lower olefin, such as ethylene and propylene, acetic<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> acid, and oxygen gas. The lower olefin is preferably ethylene or propylene.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The mist of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate SA can be formed by spraying the aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate SA into the raw material gas S. The alkali metal acetate SA is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of potassium acetate and cesium acetate. The concentration of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA is preferably 0.1 to 20% by mass. The concentration of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA may be increased or decreased over the course of the total reaction time. The supply rate of the alkali metal acetate SA is preferably from 2 to 200 mg/h per 1L of the volume of the catalyst layer.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">In addition to the raw material gas S and the mist of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA, water or an inert gas or both may be supplied through the supply line 8 to the reaction tube 2. The inert gas is preferably nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide, or a mixed gas thereof.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The reaction product R, unreacted gas, etc., are extracted through the extraction line 11. The reaction product R is vinyl acetate when the raw material gas S includes ethylene, and allyl acetate when propylene.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">The thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted into at least one of the reaction tubes 2 from the upper part of the reactor 1. The thermometer protection tube 3 is preferably inserted to reach the vicinity of the lower part of the reaction tube 2. The number of reaction tubes 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted is preferably 3 to 10. When there are a plurality of thermometer protection tubes 3, it is preferable that these thermometer protection tubes 3 be arranged uniformly or symmetrically inside the reactor 1. If there is a single thermometer protection tube 3, it is preferable that the thermometer protection tube 3 be arranged in the center of the reactor 1. In <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 1A</figref>, the thermometer protection tubes 3 are inserted into five reaction tubes 2 including the central reaction tube 2, and the thermometer 4 is inserted into each of the thermometer protection tubes 3.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The diameter of the thermometer protection tube 3 is preferably 1/6 to 1/2 of the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2, and more preferably 1/4 to 1/2 of the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2. If the thermometer protection tube 3 is too thick, the amount of catalyst filled in the reaction tube 2 decreases, as well as the cross-sectional area through which the raw material gas S flows decreases whereby the pressure loss increases, so that the reaction amount of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted relatively decreases, that<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> is, the temperature rise due to the entire reaction heat of the reactor 1 and the measured value of the thermometer 4 may deviate from each other. The material of the thermometer protection tube 3 is preferably SUS due to its excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The thermometer 4 is inserted into the thermometer protection tube 3. The thermometer is preferably a thermocouple or a resistance thermometer. When a thermocouple capable of multipoint measurement is used, the catalyst layer temperature can be measured at a plurality of positions (heights) of the reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The shield 5 is disposed above the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted, and is attached to the thermometer protection tube 3. The shield 5 is preferably attached to the thermometer protection tube 3 such that the thermometer protection tube 3 penetrates the shield 5. It is preferable that there be no gap between the shield 5 and the thermometer protection tube 3.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In the first embodiment, the effective projection region of the shield 5 entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted. The shape and size of the shield 5 are not particularly limited as long as the effective projection region of the shield 5 entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted. The shield 5 may be a disk, a rectangular plate, an elliptical plate, a cylinder, a cone, a truncated cone, or a tilted plate, or a combination thereof or a form with a part thereof missing.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The effective projection region of the shield 5 will be described with reference to <figref idref="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 2A to 2H</figref> showing the positional relationship between the effective projection region of the shield 5 and the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted. The effective projection region EPR of the shield 5 is an area on a reference plane RP obtained by projecting, in a perpendicular direction to the reference plane RP including the upper plane 22 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted and extending in parallel with the upper plane 22, an area surrounded by line segments connecting points of the shield 5 at which liquid droplets are separated from the shield 5 and drop, when the mist of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA contacts the shield 5 and flows down as the liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref> shows a plurality of reaction tubes 2, a thermometer protection tube 3 inserted into the central reaction tube 2, a thermometer 4 inserted into the thermometer protection tube 3,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and a disk-shaped shield 5 attached to the thermometer protection tube 3. Since the side of the shield 5 is vertical, when the mist of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA contacts the shield 5 and flows down as a liquid droplet, the liquid droplet is separated from the lower end of the side of the shield 5 and drops along two dotted lines extending vertically in the side view on the lower side of <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>. An area on a reference plane RP obtained by projecting, in a perpendicular direction to the reference plane RP including the upper plane 22 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted and extending in parallel with the upper plane 22, an area surrounded by line segments connecting points of the shield 5 at which liquid droplets are separated from the shield 5 is a circular effective projection region EPR surrounded by a dotted line in the top view on the upper side of <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>. In <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>, the effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the shield 5, and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref> shows a disk-shaped shield 5, which is the same as that of <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>, and is arranged off the center of the central reaction tube 2 and above the central reaction tube 2, since the thermometer protection tube 3 bends. Also in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref>, the effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the shield 5, but does not cover all of the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2, so that a liquid droplet which drops may enter the interior of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idref="f0004">Fig. 2C</figref> shows an inverted tapered shield 5 which is a combination of a truncated cone and a cylinder. A liquid droplet flows down obliquely along the side of the shield 5 and falls off at the end of the lowermost circular area. The effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the lowermost circular area of the shield 5, and covers only the vicinity of the center of the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2, so that a liquid droplet which drops may enter the interior of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idref="f0004">Fig. 2D</figref> shows an umbrella-shaped (the interior of a cone being hollow) shield 5. A liquid droplet flows down obliquely along the outer side of the shield 5 and falls off at the lower end of the shield 5. The effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of a circular area surrounded by the lower end of the shield, and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idref="f0005">Fig. 2E</figref> shows a shield 5 in which two disks having different sizes overlap and the larger disk is located on the upper side. Since the side of the larger disk is vertical, a liquid droplet falls off at the lower end of the side of the larger disk of the shield 5, as with <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>. The effective<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the larger disk and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idref="f0005">Fig. 2F</figref> shows a shield 5 in which a disk and a truncated cone are combined, the side of the disk and the conical surface of the truncated cone are discontinuous, and the disk is located on the upper side. Since the side of the disk is vertical, and the side of the disk and the conical surface of the truncated cone are discontinuous, a liquid droplet falls off at the lower end of the side of the disk of the shield 5, as with <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref>. The effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the disk and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idref="f0006">Fig. 2G</figref> shows a shield 5 in which a disk and a truncated cone are combined, the side of the disk and the conical surface of the truncated cone are continuous, and the disk is located on the upper side. Since the side of the disk and the conical surface of the truncated cone are continuous, a liquid droplet flows down obliquely along the conical surface of the truncated cone from the side of the disk and falls off at the end of the lowermost circular area. The effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of a circular area at the top of the truncated cone (the lowermost circular area of the shield 5), and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idref="f0006">Fig. 2H</figref> shows an abacus ball-like shield in which a truncated cone and a cone are combined. A liquid droplet flows down obliquely along the conical surface of the truncated cone and falls off at the end of the circular area at the bottom of the truncated cone. The effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the circular area at the bottom of the truncated cone and entirely covers the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Since the size of a liquid droplet to be formed varies depending on the material, surface roughness, presence or absence of surface treatment, etc., of the shield 5, the effective projection region EPR may also vary depending on these factors. The effective projection region EPR can be determined, for example, by spraying an aqueous solution of an alkali metal acetate having a concentration to be used onto the shield 5 in an atmosphere of a reaction temperature and observing the dropping position of a liquid droplet.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">The shields 5 shown in <figref idref="f0003">Figs. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="f0004 f0006">2D to 2H</figref> correspond to embodiments of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p0047" num="0047">The shield 5 is preferably a disk. The disk-shaped shield 5 is preferably larger than the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2, more preferably has a diameter of more than 1.0 times and 5 times or less of the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2, and further preferably has a diameter of 1.5 times or more and 3.5 times or less of the reaction tube 2. By making the diameter of the disk-shaped shield 5 larger than the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2, it is possible to more reliably prevent a liquid droplet of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA from entering the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted. In one embodiment, the diameter of the disk-shaped shield 5 may be 5 cm to 20 cm.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The material of the shield 5 is preferably SUS due to its excellent heat resistance and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> corrosion resistance.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">The shield 5 is preferably arranged above the reaction tube 2 at a distance of 5 cm to 30 cm vertically from the inlet opening 21. By arranging the shield 5 at the aforementioned distance from the inlet opening 21 of the reaction tube 2, it is possible to supply an appropriate amount of a mist of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA to the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted, while preventing a liquid droplet of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA from entering that reaction tube 2. This can reduce the difference in an amount of reaction (catalytic activity) from the reaction tube 2 in which the thermometer protection tube 3 is not inserted, thereby increasing the accuracy of the measured value of the catalyst layer temperature.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In a second embodiment, the effective projection region EPR of the shield 5 does not overlap at all the inlet opening 21 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted.

In <figref idref="f0014">Fig. 4</figref>, the effective projection region EPR corresponds to the top view of the shield 5, and does not overlap at all the inlet opening 21 of the central reaction tube 2.

A combination of the shape and size of the shield 5 and the bending of the thermometer protection tube 3 may ensure that the effective projection region EPR of the shield 5 does not overlap at all the inlet opening 21 of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is inserted.</p>

By making the diameter of the disk-shaped shield 5 larger than the inner diameter of the reaction tube 2, it is possible to prevent a liquid droplet of the aqueous solution of the alkali metal acetate SA, which is separated from the shield 5 and drops, from intensively entering one reaction tube 2. Thus, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the reaction tube 2 in which the catalytic activity is greatly reduced as compared with the surrounding reaction tubes. In one embodiment, the diameter of the disk-shaped shield 5 may be 5 cm to 20 cm.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">In the second embodiment, the material of the shield 5 is preferably SUS due to its excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance.</p>

Since the gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction for synthesizing allyl acetate is an exothermic reaction, when the reaction proceeds normally, the catalyst layer temperature is higher, that is, a positive temperature difference is observed.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">In Comparative Example 1, although a considerable amount of allyl acetate was produced, no temperature difference was observed at 1000 hours to 1300 hours from the start of the reaction. It is presumed that this is because the catalyst of the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 was inserted was deactivated due to the presence of excessive potassium acetate, and the reaction accompanied by heat generation did not occur in this reaction tube, so that the difference from the shell temperature, which is a temperature outside the reaction tube 2, disappeared. Since the reaction proceeded normally in the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 was not inserted, allyl acetate could be produced in the reactor 1 as a whole.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">On the other hand, in Example 1 in which the shield 5 was attached to the thermometer protection tube 3, the temperature difference was continuously observed even after 1000 hours from the start of the reaction.

The K amount supported on the catalyst E of Comparative Example 1, which was extracted from the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 without the shield 5 was inserted, was 12.6% by mass, and the K amount supported on the catalyst F was 12.1% by mass, and excessive potassium was supported on them.

<p id="p0108" num="0108">Based on the above results, with respect to the K amount supported, it can be understood that the catalyst extracted from the reaction tube 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 not having the shield 5 attached thereto is inserted exhibits a behavior greatly different from that of most of the reaction tubes 2 into which the thermometer protection tube 3 is not inserted, and does not represent the entirety of the catalyst layers.
