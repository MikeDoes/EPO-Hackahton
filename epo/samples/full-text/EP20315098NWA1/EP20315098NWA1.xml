<heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the preparation of aldehydes from olefins, and more particularly to preparing aldehydes from olefins using a syngas surrogate in the presence of a Group 9 metal catalyst.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Carbonylation generally refers to a group of closely connected reactions in which a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) is incorporated into a substrate. Hydroformylation, which is a type of carbonylation reaction, was discovered accidently in 1938 by Otto Roelen. The conventional reaction procedure of hydroformylation of terminal olefins is characterized by the use of a mixture of elemental hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) (generally referred to as synthesis gases or syngas), at elevated pressure in the presence of a transition metal (e.g., Groups 7-10) catalyst thereby forming aldehydes. Hydrogen ("hydro") and a formyl group (H-C=O) are added in an atom-economical manner (Scheme 1) to the olefin. Unless ethylene is used as a substrate, the reaction can lead to a mixture of isomeric products, n-aldehydes (linear), and iso-aldehydes (branched). Because double-bond isomerization (often dependent on catalyst species) of the substrate may occur prior to the hydroformylation, different branched aldehydes can also be formed even when a single terminal olefin has been subjected to the reaction. Besides the rate of the reaction, the ratio of the isomers (regioselectivity) is therefore an important parameter of each hydroformylation.

<p id="p0003" num="0003">Traditionally, industrial carbonylation processes make use of highly toxic and flammable gaseous carbon monoxide. In fact, these properties (toxicity/flammability) impede the wider use of carbonylation reactions in industry and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> academia. Therefore, performing carbonylations without the use of gaseous CO is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Carbon monoxide (CO) surrogates in alkene carbonylation reactions have been reported intermittently in the last 30 years. Syngas surrogates include carbon dioxide, methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, formates, formamide, and biomass (see <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Beller et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 2-13</text></nplcit>). However, some of these syngas surrogates require separate reaction chambers or conversion catalysts, and/or the catalysts systems invoking these syngas surrogates yield undesirable linear/branched selectivity, require higher catalyst loadings, or lead to different functional groups (e.g., alcohols, carboxylic acids).</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">A recent report of a palladium-catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins using a syngas surrogate comprising 2 equivalents of formic acid and 1 equivalent of acetic anhydride produced a mixture of the linear/branched aldehydes, as well as the corresponding carboxylic acids (see <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Shi et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 14864-14867</text></nplcit>.) Optimized conditions employing 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) ligand, and tetrabutylammonium iodide additive in dichloroethane provided the corresponding linear aldehyde in modest yields and selectivity. In addition to the use potentially carcinogenic dichloroethane, the high catalyst loading (5 mol% Pd) is economically prohibitive on industrial scale, as attempts to perform subsequent hydroformylations using the recycled palladium catalyst provided diminished yields and/or selectivity.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, new hydroformylation catalyst systems and methods for hydroformylating olefins to form aldehydes are needed.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is premised on the realization that aldehyde compounds can be synthesized from olefin substrates without using a gaseous carbon monoxide source, and instead using a syngas surrogate comprising formic acid and anhydride compound, and hydrogen, in the presence of a hydroformylation catalyst complex comprising a Group 9 metal. The hydrogen is either derived from the syngas surrogate or not derived from the syngas surrogate.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a hydroformylation catalyst system useful for converting an olefin substrate to an aldehyde product is provided. The hydroformylation catalyst system comprises (or consists essentially of) a hydroformylation catalyst complex comprising a Group 9<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> metal complexed with a phosphine-based ligand; and a syngas surrogate comprising formic acid and an anhydride compound, which in the presence of the hydroformylation catalyst complex forms carbon monoxide <i>in situ,</i> and hydrogen, which is either derived from the syngas surrogate <i>in situ</i> or not derived from the syngas surrogate.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method of preparing an aldehyde compound is provided. The method comprising mixing an olefin substrate in a hydroformylation catalyst system to form a reaction mixture, wherein the hydroformylation catalyst system comprises (or consists essentially of) a hydroformylation catalyst complex and a syngas surrogate comprising formic acid and an anhydride compound, which in the presence of the hydroformylation catalyst complex forms carbon monoxide <i>in situ,</i> and hydrogen, which is either derived from the syngas surrogate <i>in situ</i> or not derived from the syngas surrogate. The hydroformylation catalyst complex comprises a Group 9 metal complexed with a phosphine-based ligand. The Group 9 metal is selected from the group consisting of cobalt, rhodium, and iridium, preferably rhodium. The method may further include isolating the aldehyde compound from the reaction mixture to provide an aldehyde product and a hydroformylation catalyst residue comprising the hydroformylation catalyst complex.</p>

<heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a hydroformylation catalyst system comprising hydrofomylation catalyst complex and a syngas surrogate, which is characterized by excellent catalytic activity and stability, and is capable of controlling the linear-branched (l/b) selectivity in the aldehyde product. It is a further object to provide a hydroformylation process using the same.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance therewith, the present invention relates to a hydroformylation catalyst system and a hydroformylation process to produce aldehydes from olefin substrates using the same. More particularly, the hydroformylation catalyst system includes a hydroformylation catalyst complex comprising a Group 9 metal complexed with a phosphine-based ligand, and a syngas surrogate comprising formic acid and an anhydride compound, which in the presence of the hydroformylation catalyst complex<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> forms carbon monoxide <i>in situ,</i> and hydrogen, which is either derived from the syngas surrogate <i>in situ</i> or not derived from the syngas surrogate. The syngas surrogate obviates the need to supply gaseous carbon monoxide to the hydroformylation catalyst system, but does not preclude the optional addition of hydrogen gas. Application of the hydroformylation catalyst system comprising the hydroformylation catalyst complex in the presence of the syngas surrogate to olefin substrates provides the desired aldehyde product with excellent catalytic activity and stability, as well as good linear/branched (l/b) selectivity.</p>

<p id="p0022" num="0022">Alternatively, the content of the phosphine-based ligand may be expressed as a molar equivalent relative to the moles of Group 9 metal present in the catalyst system, and thus in the range of 1 to 500 moles, such as 2 to 250, 5 to 200, or 10 to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 150, based on 1 mole of Group 9 metal. Thus, based on the Group 9 metal present in the catalyst complex, the molar equivalents of phosphine-based ligand may be 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, or in a range between any two of the foregoing. Non-limiting examples of phosphine-based ligand to Group 9 metal molar ratios include, but are not limited to, 1:1 to 500:1, 1:1 to 300:1, 1:1 to 200:1, 1:1 to 150:1, 1:1 to 100:1, 1:1 to 75:1, or 1:1 to 50:1.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Phosphine-based ligands can be susceptible to oxidation to their corresponding phosphine oxides, which appear to be ineffective ligands for the Group 9 metal-based hydroformylation catalyst. Oxidants such as molecular oxygen or peroxides are particularly effective at oxidizing phosphines into phosphine oxides. Accordingly, it is preferable to minimize the presence of adventitious oxygen in the hydroformylation reaction system. However, even if the hydroformylation reaction system is completely void of any adventitious oxygen, oxidation of phosphine ligand to the inactive phosphine oxide has been observed. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that perhaps the phosphine ligand can also act as oxygen acceptor in the transformation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into ligand carbon monoxide (CO), where the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) arises from a Group 9 metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation reaction of formic (HCO<sub>2</sub>H) acid into carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Peroxides may be present in the hydroformylation reaction system by way of being an impurity in one or more of the hydroformylation reaction system components (e.g., olefin substrate or solvent). Accordingly, pretreatment of the olefin and/or solvent with an antioxidant, such as a saturated aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), followed by distillation may be useful to substantially reduce or eliminate peroxide impurities. In an embodiment, the olefin substrate can be washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite, partitioned from the aqueous layer, and optionally distilled to remove any traces of water.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Nevertheless, conversion of the phosphine ligand into its inactive phosphine oxide may be offset by adding more of a suitable phosphine ligand (same or different) over the course of the reaction. Alternatively, the reaction may be initiated with an abundance of the phosphine-based ligand in the hydroformylation catalyst system to ensure a sufficient quantity of phosphine-based ligand is present throughout<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the entire course of the olefin conversion to aldehyde and thereby maintain a desirable level of catalyst complex activity and selectivity.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment, the hydroformylation catalyst complex comprises rhodium and the phosphine-based ligand. Preferably rhodium is provided as a rhodium compound selected from the group consisting of Rh(acac)(CO)<sub>2</sub>, [Rh(COD)Cl]<sub>2</sub>, and [(MeO)Rh(COD)]<sub>2</sub>, more particularly Rh(acac)(CO)<sub>2</sub>.; and the phosphine-based ligand is a monodentate triaryl phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine (TPP), or a bidendate diarylalkyl phosphine, such as 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe). In connection with this, when the total content of the monodentate phosphine-based ligand at the beginning of the reaction is less than 10 moles based on 1 mole of rhodium and its slow oxidation was not offset by addition of more phosphine-based ligand, diminished conversion and/or selectivity was observed. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the initial molar ratio of the monodentate phosphine ligand to rhodium is at least 10:1, such as at least 15:1, at least 20:1, at least 25:1, at least 30:1, at least 35:1, at least 40:1, at least 50:1, at least 75:1, at least 100:1, or at least 200:1 or in a range between any two of the foregoing. If the total molar ratio of the above phosphine-based ligand to rhodium is more than 500, cost is increased without an apparent additional benefit.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">No special provisions are required for the preparation of the hydroformylation catalyst complex employed in the practice of the present invention, although it is preferred, for high catalyst activity, that all manipulations of the Group 9 metal and phosphine-based ligand components be carried out under an inert atmosphere, e.g., N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and the like. The desired quantities of a suitable Group 9 metal compound and the phosphine-based ligand are charged to the reactor in a suitable solvent. The sequence in which the various catalyst components are charged to the reactor is not critical. Thus, the Group 9 metal compound can be added to the reactor, then the phosphine-based ligand; or conversely, the phosphine-based ligand can be added to the reactor, then the Group 9 metal compound; or, alternatively, a preformed Group 9 metal - phosphine-based ligand complex can be charged to the reactor.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Embodiments of the present invention further provide a syngas surrogate including formic acid and an anhydride, which in the presence of the hydroformylation catalyst complex forms carbon monoxide <i>in situ,</i> and hydrogen, which is either derived from the syngas surrogate <i>in situ</i> or not derived from the syngas surrogate. The formic<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> acid and anhydride should be sufficiently pure and free of any impurities that could poison the active catalytic species. Advantageously, the formic acid and the anhydride may be distilled prior to use.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Formic acid is hygroscopic and thus the moisture content should be minimized, so as to avoid hydrolyzing the anhydride compound. For example, formic acid may be characterized having a moisture content less than 5 wt%, such as 2 wt% or less.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">The anhydride is selected from a compound having a general Formula (3) (R<sup>7</sup>C=O)-O-(O=CR<sup>8</sup>), where R<sup>7</sup> and R<sup>8</sup> are independently selected from a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, where the substituent group may be a nitro (-NO<sub>2</sub>), fluoride (-F), chloride (-Cl), bromide (-Br), or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of symmetric anhydrides (where R<sup>7</sup> and R<sup>8</sup> are the same) include acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, isobutyric anhydride, pentanoic (valeric) anhydride, 3-methylbutyric (isovaleric) anhydride, and hexanoic anhydride. In an embodiment, the anhydride is selected from the group consisting of acetic anhydride, proprionic anhydride, isovaleric anhydride, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the anhydride comprises acetic anhydride.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Based on the olefin substrate, the quantity of formic acid in the reaction mixture may be between 1 and 10 equivalents, preferably between 1.1 to 3 equivalents; and the quantity of acetic anhydride may be between 1 to 5 equivalents, preferably between 1.1 and 1.5 equivalents. In an embodiment, a mole ratio between formic acid and the anhydride is in a range from 1:1 to 4:1, preferably between 1:1 to 5:2.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that formic acid and the anhydride react to form a mixed anhydride, which under the hydroformylation reaction conditions decomposes <i>in situ</i> to form the required carbon monoxide reactant for the hydroformylation reaction and a carboxylic acid. In the case where the anhydride is acetic anhydride, the mixed anhydride is formic acetic anhydride. The <i>in situ</i> generated carbon monoxide binds to the Group 9 metal center of the active catalyst complex and eventually incorporates into the olefin substrate to form the desired aldehyde.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">When formic acid is present in a stoichiometric excess relative to the anhydride (i.e., the mole ratio of formic acid to anhydride is greater than one) in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> syngas surrogate, the required hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) reactant for the hydroformylation reaction is also generated <i>in situ,</i> presumably from the Group 9-catalyzed dehydrogenation of formic acid, along with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). If the stoichiometric excess formic acid is at least equimolar to the olefin substrate (e.g., 2 equivalents of formic acid and 1 equivalent of anhydride, based on the olefin substrate), then a separate supply of hydrogen should not be necessary to effect full or substantially full conversion of the olefin substrate. However, if the amount of formic acid is insufficient to generate the requisite hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) reactant, then hydrogen pressure should be supplied to the reaction vessel. Excessive hydrogen pressure (e.g., &gt; 100 bar) prior to generating carbon monoxide may increase the hydrogenation side reaction pathway. In an embodiment, the mole ratio of formic acid to anhydride in the syngas surrogate is one or less, and thus hydrogen gas pressure is applied to the reaction vessel. Thus, the reaction vessel may be charged with hydrogen pressure to 25 bar or less, such as 20 bar, 15 bar, 10 bar, 4 bar, or 1 bar. For example, in an embodiment, each of the formic acid and the anhydride are present in the hydroformylation catalyst system in 1.1 equivalents, based on the olefin substrate, and an external supply of hydrogen gas (e.g., in a range of 1 to 20 bar, preferably in a range of 4 to 10 bar) is applied to the sealed reaction vessel prior to heating.</p>

<p id="p0037" num="0037">In the hydroformylation process, a preferable reaction temperature and reaction pressure may include those known in the art.

Upon heating to a sufficient temperature to initiate the generation of CO, and optionally H<sub>2</sub>, from the syngas surrogate, pressure in the hydroformylation reaction system initially rises, and then system pressure decreases as the reactant gases (CO/H<sub>2</sub>) react with the olefin substrate forming the desired aldehyde compound.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, hydroformylation catalyst complex is recyclable and maintains satisfactory conversion and selectivity through multiple batch runs. These characteristics arise from the maintenance of the appropriate ratio of phosphine ligand to Group 9 metal over the course of the hydroformylation reaction. The slow conversion of the phosphine ligand into its inactive phosphine oxide may be offset by adding more of a suitable phosphine ligand (same or different) over the course of the reaction or by starting the reaction with a substantial excess of the phosphine ligand. In an embodiment, the molar ratio of phosphine-base ligand to Group 9 metal is at least 1:1, such as 2:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1 or more, 40:1 or more, 50:1 or more, or 100:1 or more.

<p id="p0057" num="0057">Comparative example (entry a) utilized palladium acetate to effect the hydroformylation of 1,4-dimethyl-4-vinylcyclohexene (DMVCH) under the optimized conditions of the prior art (e.g., dichlorethane solvent, tetrabutylammonium iodide additive). Attempts to effect the hydroformylation of DMVCH with two different ruthenium compounds (comparative examples of entries b and c) failed to form any of the corresponding aldehyde.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">In entries d through j, various rhodium-containing hydroformylation catalyst complexes were investigated for the hydroformylation of 1,4-dimethyl-4-vinylcyclohexene (DMVCH). In entries g through j, various anhydride compounds were studied in a rhodium-based hydroformylation catalyst system. In entry k through entry m, iridium- and cobalt-based hydroformylation catalyst complexes were investigated for the hydroformylation of DMVCH. In these examples, the Group 9 metal compound, a phosphine-based ligand, DMVCH, solvent (2-MeTHF, 1M DMVCH), formic acid, and the anhydride compound were added to an autoclave, which was purged with nitrogen, sealed, and then stirred while heating to an elevated temperature. At the end of the reaction period, the reaction mixture was cooled, vented, and an aliquot analyzed by GC-FID (HP-DB1 (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm), H<sub>2</sub> 1.4 mL/min, 50°C to 250°C at 50°C/min and 250°C for 10min). Conversion, selectivity, and linear:branched (I:b) ratios were determined by GC area percent (GC%). Overall, the Group 9 metal-based hydroformylation catalyst systems proved to be acceptable in conversion and selectivity, whereas the ruthenium-based catalyst failed to effect the desired hydroformylation.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Due to the high costs of precious metal catalysts, the recyclability of various hydroformylation catalyst complexes was further investigated (see Table 2). At the end of the initial reaction, the solvent, any unreacted starting materials, and reaction products were removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The undistilled fraction comprising the hydroformylation catalyst residue was combined with DMVCH, solvent (2-MeTHF, 1M DMVCH), formic acid (2.2 equiv), and the anhydride compound (1.1 equiv) in an autoclave, which was purged with nitrogen, sealed, and then stirred while heating to the desired reaction temperature. At the end of the reaction period, the reaction mixture was cooled, vented, and an aliquot analyzed by GC. The recycling process may be repeated, with or without adding more phosphine based ligand to offset any observed oxidation.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">While a comparative experiment using a fresh palladium catalyst provided good conversion on initial reaction, the selectivity for the aldehyde product was modest (76%), and the recycled catalyst's yield degraded in subsequent reactions. In contrast, recycled rhodium catalyst maintained its high conversion (&gt;90%) and selectivity (94%) (see Table 2). Non-optimized experiments run with other Group 9 metals (i.e., iridium and cobalt) showed good conversion with modest selectivity for the desired aldehyde. But in these Ir and Co examples, excellent linear:branch (l:b) selectivity was achieved.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> -->

<p id="p0067" num="0067">In Examples 16a and 16b, the autoclave was pressurized with externally applied hydrogen gas to 4 bar and 10 bar, respectively, before heating to 90°C. Excellent conversion and selectivity to the desired aldehyde was achieved, with minimal hydrogenation side product produced (&lt;5%). Under these conditions, the extent of oxidation of the phosphine-based ligand was less than 10%.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">In Example 16c, the autoclave was sealed after nitrogen purge, but no hydrogen gas was introduced prior to heating. Pressure increased to 20 bar upon heating to 90°C, and remained constant with no observed conversion of the starting DMVCH; the observed pressure increase was due, in part, to thermal expansion, but also the generation of carbon monoxide. After 15 hours at 90°C, external hydrogen gas was applied until the system pressure increased to 25 bar, and then the sealed system was permitted to react for another 5 hours. After 5 hours, internal pressure had dropped to 10 bar, and 63% conversion was achieved with about 90% selectivity of the desired aldehyde and only 0.3% hydrogenation product. Under these conditions, the extent of oxidation of the phosphine-based ligand was less than 10%.</p>
