<heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an adhesive, a laminate, a packaging material, and a packaging container, as well as a method for recycling a substrate and a method for producing a recycled substrate.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, packages, plastic bottles, and other plastic products made from plastic film materials have been disposed and dumped as garbage into the ocean, causing environmental pollution problems. These plastic products are degraded in seawater into submicron-sized debris (microplastics), and they float in seawater. If marine organisms, such as fish, ingest such plastic products, they get concentrated within those marine organisms, causing concerns that they might affect the health of seabirds and humans who consume such marine organisms as food. In addition, chemicals etc. originating from inks, adhesives, coating layers, and the like are also attached to the surface of microplastics generated from the packages, which cause more concerns on environmental conservation. In order to overcome these problems, various efforts to reduce microplastics have been beginning.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The plastic products above mainly include food packages and the like using plastic substrates. In those packages, various types of plastic substrates such as a polyester (PET) substrate, a nylon (NY) substrate, and a polypropylene (PP) substrate are used as film substrates. These plastic substrates are provided with a printed layer with gravure ink, flexographic ink, or other printing ink, and further adhered to a hot-melt resin substrate via an adhesive or the like to form a laminate, and the laminate is then cut and heat-sealed to form a package.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples of the attempts to reduce the microplastics include: (1) a method of replacing the plastic substrate in the package with "paper", which is made from wood material, a renewable resource; (2) a method of using a mono-material (polyolefin) plastic substrate in the package and recycling the plastic substrate; and (3) a method of removing the impurities in the package and recycling the plastic substrate.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The method (1) above is promising in terms of safety and recyclability but it is in many aspects inferior to the conventional plastic substrates in terms of performance, such as in gas and water vapor barrier properties and water resistance.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">For the method (2) above, techniques are being developed to overcome the shortcomings of polyolefins by functional coating agents, such as a barrier coating agent, but such a material is inferior to the conventional plastic substrates in terms of performance, such as in suitability for retort pouch and in light-shielding properties, and thus the replacement by a polyolefin is not easy. Furthermore, the inks, functional coating agents, adhesives, and the like between the polyolefin substrates will become impurities in recycling the polyolefins which is also a problem.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">For the method (3) above, attempts have been made to remove the printed layer on the outer surface of the package, which would become an impurity in the recycling process, by using an aqueous alkali solution.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">For example, Reference Document 1 discloses that, in relation to the adhesives used for labels and other attached items, an adhesive containing a copolymer comprising the units of a lower alkyl ester of acrylic acid and/or maleic acid can be removed with alkaline water. Also, in relation to the adhesives used in adhesive tapes, Patent Document 2 discloses an adhesive tape having excellent alkali peelability comprising a natural rubber and a high acid number tackifier. Reference Document 3 discloses a technique in which a primer layer consisting of an acrylic-based resin or a styrene-maleic-based resin is provided on a plastic substrate, and a printed layer, which is disposed on the primer layer, is removed with alkaline water. In addition, Patent Document 4 discloses a technique in which an ink containing as a binder resin a polyurethane or acrylic resin having an acidic group is printed and the printed layer is similarly removed with alkaline water. However, these techniques only remove the surface-printed inks on the outside of the package and they have not been successful in detaching the sealant substrates and other substrates in the laminates.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">It would be an industrially useful, important technology for promoting the recycling of the plastics and contributing to the environmental conservation, if the technology could allow detachment of the sealant substrate and the other substrates in order to recycle the sealant substrate (which is especially thick and occupies a large proportion of the packaging material as a whole) from the packaging materials, wherein the packaging materials are formed by using an adhesive to laminate the sealant substrate and a substrate comprising a plastic layer and a print layer, such as a pattern layer. However, no packaging material has been reported so far that comprises an adhesive layer satisfying both the required performance for a laminate adhesive and the function of allowing detachment of the sealant substrate and the other substrates.</p>

<p id="p0176" num="0176">Using the adhesive solutions thus obtained, laminates (composite films) were produced according to the method described below. For the resulting laminates, a laminate strength test and a removability test were carried out as described below. The results are shown in Table 2.</p>
<heading id="h0063">(Production of composite film (laminate))</heading>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">A three-layer composite film (laminate) of a PET film (thickness 12 µm)/an NY film (thickness 15 µm)/a CPP film (thickness 70 µm, surface treated with corona discharge) was produced by the method described below.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">That is, the adhesive solution was applied onto the PET film at room temperature by using a laminator, and after the solvent was evaporated, the applied surface was adhered to the NY film. The adhesive solution was then applied onto the NY film surface of the laminate in the same manner as before, and after the solvent was evaporated, the applied surface was adhered to the CPP film. The resulting laminate was then kept at 40°C for 4 days, and the three-layer composite film was thus obtained.</p>

However, for the packaging material 9, the test piece was cut out from the packaging material after boiling, and for the packaging materials 12 to 14, the test pieces were cut out from the packaging materials after retorting. The time taken for the two substrates contacting the polyurethane-based adhesive layer to detach from each other was measured, and the removability was evaluated according to the following criteria.

<li>A: The two substrates contacting the polyurethane-based adhesive layer are completely detached from each other in less than 6 hours (good)</li>
<li>B: The two substrates contacting the polyurethane-based adhesive layer are completely detached from each other in 6 hours to less than 12 hours (usable)</li>
