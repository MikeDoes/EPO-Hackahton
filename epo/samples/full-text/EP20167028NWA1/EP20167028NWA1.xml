<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to converters for light sources, in particular LEDs. In particular, the invention relates to a method for operating a primary side switched converter for providing a voltage supply to an LED load, as well as an isolated primary side switched converter and a driver for light sources comprising such a converter.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Converters can be used as DC/DC stages in LED drivers for supplying an LED load with a regulated output voltage. An example for such a converter is a primary side switched converter.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Primary side switched converters generally comprise a transformer which is arranged between a primary and a secondary side of the converter, wherein both sides are galvanically isolated from each other, and wherein the primary side comprises at least one switch. A half bridge LLC converter is an example for such a converter.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">It is usually important to ensure that the output voltage of such an LED converter does not exceed a threshold value of, for instance, 60 volts. This threshold value is prescribed by a corresponding standard for low level operation of LEDs, since a user may accidentally touch the normally unprotected lines.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The output voltage of such converters can be sensed via magnetic coupling to a secondary side winding of the converter. If it is detected, that the voltage reaches a threshold value the LED converter shuts down.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the determination of the output voltage of such a converter can be subject to certain fluctuations or tolerances. Such fluctuations can be linked to the magnetic behavior, in particular leakage flux, or a current depending voltage drop of the output rectification and output filter of the LED converter, and can be caused by a number of external and internal factors.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">To make sure that the threshold value is never exceeded, the drivers are designed in such a way that the voltage supply of the LEDs is already switched off if the output voltage reaches a shutdown level below the 60 volt threshold, e.g. at 50 volts. However, due to this limitation the converter cannot provide a supply voltage near the 60 volt threshold.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, it is an objective of the invention to provide an improved primary side switched converter, an improved driver comprising such a converter and an improved method for operating a primary side switched converter, which avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages. In particular, it is the object of the invention to provide an isolated primary side switched converter, which allows an efficient compensation of deviations of the determined output voltage.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The object of the present invention is achieved by the solution provided in the enclosed independent claims. Advantageous implementations of the present invention are further defined in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for operating an isolated primary side switched converter for providing a voltage supply to an LED load, wherein the converter comprises a galvanic isolation stage, the method comprising the steps of:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="bullet" compact="compact">
<li>detecting a feedback signal at a primary side of the galvanic isolation stage, wherein the feedback signal corresponds to a secondary side voltage,</li>
<li>determining an LED supply voltage based on the feedback signal,</li>
<li>calculating a threshold value based on a constant reference voltage and an adjustment factor, wherein the adjustment factor is a dynamic factor whose absolute value increases with increasing LED current, and</li>
<li>interrupting the voltage supply to the LED load if the determined LED supply voltage exceeds the threshold value.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">This achieves the advantage that current depending deviations of the calculated LED supply voltage can be compensated efficiently. In particular, these deviations are considered when determining the threshold voltage at which the converter is shut off. Thus, a higher output voltage, e.g. 54V, can be provided without risking that the voltage exceeds a maximal value of 60V.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">The converter can be a resonant or hard switched converter. In particular, the converter is one of the following types: LCC, flyback, or synchronous flyback.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The converter can comprise a switching network on the primary side of the galvanic isolation stage. The switching network can comprise two or four switches.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The converter can be a DC/DC stage for supplying the LED load with a regulated output voltage. In particular, the secondary side voltage corresponds to the output voltage.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The adjustment factor is either a positive voltage value, which increases with increasing LED current, or a negative voltage value, which further decreases with increasing LED current.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The threshold value represents a threshold voltage for supplying the LEDs. In particular, the converter is configured to interrupt the voltage supply of the LED load as soon as the LED supply voltage reaches the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The LED supply voltage can be determined by passing the feedback signal through a voltage divider and/or transforming the feedback signal to a digital voltage signal.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The LED current can be detected by a current sensing unit of the converter. The current sensing unit can comprise a further auxiliary winding on the primary side of the galvanic isolation stage that is magnetically coupled to at least one secondary side winding.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The LED load can comprise an LED module, an LED luminaire and/or an LED track.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment, the adjustment factor comprises a constant term and a dynamic term that is dependent on the LED current. This achieves the advantage that current depending deviations in the determined output voltage can be compensated efficiently.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">In an embodiment, the adjustment factor comprises a linear function of the LED current.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">For instance, the threshold value (V<sub>ref,comp</sub>) is calculated according to the following equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">ref</mi><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">comp</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">ref</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">I</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">LED</mi></msub><mo>*</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub></mfenced><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="79" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> with V<sub>ref</sub> being the reference voltage and (I<sub>LED</sub> * x<sub>1</sub>) + x<sub>2</sub> being the adjustment factor, wherein I<sub>LED</sub> is the LED current and x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> are constant correction parameters.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">In an embodiment, the linear function is determined by performing at least two calibration measurements at different LED currents. This provides the advantage that the adjustment factor can take device specific deviations into account.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">For instance, the calibration measurements can comprise driving the converter at two different loads, i.e. at two different currents, and measuring the offset of the output voltage at each current. By fitting a linear regression to the two measurement points the correction parameters x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> can<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> be determined.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Alternatively, the adjustment factor may comprise a higher order function of the LED current.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment, the adjustment factor comprises a temperature dependent part. This achieves the advantage that temperature depending deviations in the determined output voltage can be compensated efficiently.</p>

<p id="p0028" num="0028">In an embodiment, the temperature dependent part is a linear or higher order function of the temperature, or wherein the temperature dependent part is determined based on a look-up-table. This achieves the advantage that temperature depending deviations in the determined output voltage can be compensated efficiently.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The look-up-table can be stored in a memory of the converter, in particular a memory of an ASIC or microcontroller of the converter.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">For instance, the threshold value (V<sub>ref,comp</sub>) is calculated according to the following equation: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">ref</mi><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">comp</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">ref</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">I</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">LED</mi></msub><mo>*</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></msub></mfenced><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi></mfenced><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="97" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein x(T) is the temperature dependent part. In particular, T(X) is a linear equation, such as x(T) = x * T, with T being the temperature and x being a constant factor.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">In an embodiment, the adjustment factor depends on a dimming level of the LED load.</p>
