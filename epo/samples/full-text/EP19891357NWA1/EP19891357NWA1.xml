<heading id="h0002"><b><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading>
<heading id="h0003"><b>(a) Field of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a positive electrode additive for a lithium secondary battery, a manufacturing method thereof, a positive electrode for a lithium secondary battery including the same, and a lithium secondary battery including the same. More specifically, it relates to a positive electrode additive for a lithium secondary battery that is a non-reversible capacity improving additive for improving the non-reversible characteristic of a negative electrode, a manufacturing method thereof, a positive electrode for a lithium secondary battery including the same, and a lithium secondary battery including the same.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>(b) Description of the Related Art</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The lithium secondary battery is manufactured in the form of a small<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> battery with high performance and is used as an energy storage source for mobile information communication devices including smartphones, laptops, and computers. Recently, a research is being conducted to manufacture a high-output, large-sized battery and use it in an electric vehicle, a hybrid electric vehicle, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As a positive active material of the lithium secondary battery, lithium-containing cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) is mainly used, and in addition, lithium-containing manganese oxide such as LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> having a spinel crystal structure, and lithium-containing nickel oxide (LiNiO<sub>2</sub>) are also used.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Carbon material is mainly used as a negative active material, and lithium metal and sulfur compound are also considered. In particular, the theoretical specific capacity of pure silicon (Si) is 4200 mAh/g, which is 372 of graphite carbon. Since a capacity of silicon is superbly larger than that of graphite, lithium secondary batteries using the Si-based active material are attracting a lot of attention, and some are used as electrodes mixed with carbon materials.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">However, when the negative electrode has low non-reversible efficiency compared to the positive electrode, the amount of negative active material is excessively input and that makes negatively effects of the energy density of the battery.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In such an electrode, if the efficiencies of the positive and negative electrodes are adjusted to a similar level, waste of inefficient electrodes can be minimized. For example, when a positive electrode having an efficiency of 100% is used compared to a negative electrode having an efficiency of approximately 100%, the battery may exhibit an efficiency of 100%. On the other hand, when<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a negative electrode having an efficiency of 90% is used for a positive electrode having an efficiency of 100%, the battery can exhibit only an efficiency of 90%. As a result, there is a problem that 10% of the positive electrode is wasted unnecessarily.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In this regard, a lithium composite oxide containing nickel (Ni) of high-capacity, cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) is generally used as a positive active material, and a silicon-carbon composite negative active material may be used. In this case, the non-reversible efficiency of the positive electrode during initial charging and discharging including the initial charging is very high as 90% or more, but the initial non-reversible efficiency of the negative electrode is at the level of 80 to 90%.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Also, due to the difference in non-reversible efficiencies between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, the non-reversible action of the electrode having high non-reversible efficiency is induced. In order to improve this non-reversible action, it is necessary to use more positive active material with high non-reversible efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, a small amount of negative active material is input for the design of the battery together with the positive electrode of lithium composite oxide containing the high nickel-containing nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn). In order to design a battery with a high energy density using lithium composite oxide containing high nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn), which is the original purpose, the amount of carbon-based negative active material is reduced. It may be difficult to design efficiently.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, there is an attempt to improve the non-reversible capacity by<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> adding Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub> as a technology that can solve this problem. As the amount of additives increases, slurry gelation by residual lithium remaining in Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub> may become a problem. In addition, there is a problem that Ni elution and gas generation continues as the charge and discharge cycle proceeds. There is a high need for improvement in this regard.</p>

<p id="p0046" num="0046">A positive electrode additive for a lithium secondary battery according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is represented by Chemical Formula 1 below. The additive represented by Chemical Formula 1 below is doped lithium rich cobalt oxide.<br/>

</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the Chemical Formula 1, 0.9≤x≤1.1, 0&lt;y≤0.1, My = B<sub>a</sub>W<sub>b</sub>, 0≤a≤0.1, 0≤b≤0.1, and, a and b are not simultaneously 0. That is, at least one doping element among boron (B) and tungsten (W) is necessarily included. If one or more doping elements among boron (B) and tungsten (W) are included in the additive, there is merit in reducing the gelation of the cathode material slurry<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> compared to the other case.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">In this case, the positive electrode additive may be coating at least one of boron (B) and tungsten (W). When a coating layer is used, stable non-reversible capacity can be realized. In addition, there is no gelation of the cathode material slurry, which is a problem when manufacturing electrode slurry, so there is no problem even if a lot of this additive is used during slurry manufacturing. The reason is as follows. Li<sub>2</sub>O and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> remaining on the additive surface are changed into stable lithium boron compound (LiB<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) and lithium tungsten compound (Li<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) by reacting boron compound and tungsten compound. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the PVDF binder gelation by basic lithium during slurry production. It can be used more stably in the process of manufacturing the electrode.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In general, lithium in the form of lithium carbonate (Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH), which do not mainly participate in the reaction, is unavoidably present on the surface of lithium composite oxide containing Ni and Co, and this is called residual lithium. As such, in a battery in which lithium composite oxide, which has residual lithium on its surface, is applied to the positive electrode as a positive electrode active material, gas is generated by the residual lithium during charging and discharging. Specifically, LiOH in residual lithium can react with CO<sub>2</sub> in air or CO<sub>2</sub> generated by decomposition of carbonate-based electrolyte solution to form Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. In addition, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> may react with HF again to generate CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Such gas generation causes problems such as a decrease in the initial capacity of the battery and a decrease in initial charging and discharge efficiency. However, when boron or tungsten is added as described above, the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> amount of residual lithium can be reduced and the initial charge capacity can be improved.</p>

<p id="p0101" num="0101">In <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>, a comparative example, has a discharge capacity of 120 mAh/g compared to a charge capacity of 380 mAh/g and a non-reversible capacity of about 260 mAh/g. Example 1 shows a non-reversible capacity of about 720 mAh/g with a discharge capacity of 30 mAh/g compared to a 750 mAh/g charge capacity. Example 1 shows a higher non-reversible capacity. In addition, Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub> is changed to LiNiO<sub>2</sub> after charging, causing a gas generation problem as it is continuously decomposed and eluted into NiO during the charging and discharging process. However, the positive electrode additive, which exhibits the effect of improving the non-reversible capacity of Li<sub>6</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub>, decomposes Li<sub>6</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub> after charging and moves six Li to the negative electrode to supplement the non-reversible lithium of the negative electrode. The positive electrode remains LiCoO<sub>2</sub> with good conductivity. O<sub>2</sub> gas generated during charging is removed in the stage of removing generated gas after initial charging and discharging in the completed cell. Since it is stable after that, there is no problem of continuous gas generation during charging and discharging like Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub> positive electrode additive, so it has greater merit.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">In addition, the samples of Examples 5 to 12 do not have a gelation<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> phenomenon of the cathode material slurry compared to other samples, so there is a merit that there is no problem with the use of a lot of cathode additives that have a non-reversible capacity improvement effect. This is because the boron compound and tungsten compound react with the Li<sub>2</sub>O and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> remaining on the surface of the additive to change into stable lithium boron compound (LiB<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) and lithium tungsten compound (Li<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>). In other words, it has the merit that it can be used more stably in the electrode manufacturing process by reducing the PVDF binder gelation by basic lithium during slurry manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">However, as the BW content increases, there is a large reduction in the charging capacity, so the mixing ratio of the doping raw material is preferably 0.001 to 0.02 molar ratio.</p>

<p id="p0104" num="0104">For the slurry for the production of electrode plates, the positive electrode additive prepared by Example 11 was used. Anode additive: anode active material: conductive material (super-C65): binder (PVDF, KF1120) = 1:95.5:1.5:2%, and NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone) was added so that the solid content was about 30%. was added to adjust the slurry viscosity. The prepared slurry was coated on Al foil of 15 µm thickness using a doctor blade (Doctor blade), then dried and rolled. The electrode loading amount was 14.6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the rolling density was 3.1 g/cm3. As the electrolyte solution, 1.5% VC was added to 1M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC:DMC:EMC=3:4:3 (vol%), and a PP separator and lithium negative electrode (200um, Honzo metal) were used to prepare a coin cell. After aging at room temperature for 10 hours, charge and discharge tests were<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> performed.

<p id="p0113" num="0113">If a graphite negative electrode is used instead of a lithium negative electrode as in the case of no positive electrode additive (Comparative Examples 2-1 and 2-2), the discharge capacity of 20mAh/g is reduced due to the non-reversible negative electrode. It compensates for the non-reversible part of the negative electrode as in the case where a lot of positive additive is added (Experimental Examples 2-5, 2-6). Therefore, it shows the same discharge capacity as when using a lithium negative electrode, which has merit to realize stable charging and discharging capacity. The amount of the positive electrode additive can be used by adjusting the optimum amount according to the non-reversible capacity of the negative electrode.</p>
