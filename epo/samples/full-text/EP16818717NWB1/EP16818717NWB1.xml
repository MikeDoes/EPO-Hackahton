<heading id="h0003"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are a family of rare mesenchymal neoplasms composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinctive epithelioid cells. The PEComa family of tumors include, for example, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), angiomyolipoma (AML), pulmonary clear cell 'sugar' tumors, and PEComa not otherwise specified (PEComa-NOS; a term referring to less well-characterized PEComas of a variety of other anatomical origins). PEComas share a distinctive cell type, namely, the perivascular epithelioid cell, and are often structured as nests and sheets, or occasionally spindled cells, with a focal association with blood vessel walls. <i>See,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Hornick, J.

<p id="p0004" num="0004">While most PEComas are benign, a subset of aggressive PEComas exhibit malignant behavior and develop, for example, locally invasive or distant metastases. <i>See,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Gennatas, C. et al., World J Surg Oncol, 10:1-4 (2012</text></nplcit>);<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text> Wagner, A.

<p id="p0005" num="0005">First-line treatment of PEComas is surgical resection. <i>See,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Martignoni, G. et al., Virchows Arch, 452:119-132 (2008</text></nplcit>). Treatment regimen with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy remains controversial. The rarity of documented PEComas has prevented the use of designed therapeutic trials to investigate novel regimen for the treatment of PEComas. <i>See,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Selvaggi, F. et al., BMC Surg, 11 (2011</text></nplcit>); <nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Waters, P.

Accordingly, these subsets of PEComas remain very difficult to treat. The prognosis for patients within these patient subsets is poor, with a median survival estimated to be 12-17 months following diagnosis of advanced disease.

<p id="p0029" num="0029">As used herein, "treatment" or "treating" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: alleviating one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, diminishing the extent of the disease, stabilizing the disease (e.g., preventing or delaying the worsening of the disease), preventing or delaying the spread (e.g., metastasis) of the disease, preventing or delaying the recurrence of the disease, delaying or slowing the progression of the disease, ameliorating the disease state, providing a remission (partial or total) of the disease, decreasing the dose of one or more other medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, increasing the quality of life, and/or prolonging survival. Also encompassed by "treatment" is a reduction of a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> pathological consequence of a PEComa. The methods of the disclosure contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment.</p>

<p id="p0031" num="0031">As used herein, an "at risk" individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a PEComa. An individual "at risk" may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. "At risk" denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a PEComa, which are described herein. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing cancer than an individual without these risk factor(s).</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">"Adjuvant setting" refers to a clinical setting in which an individual has had a history of a PEComa, and generally (but not necessarily) been responsive to therapy, which includes, but is not limited to, surgery (e.g., surgical resection), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, because of their history of a PEComa, these individuals are considered at risk of development of the disease. Treatment or administration in the "adjuvant setting" refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. The degree of risk (e.g., when an individual in the adjuvant setting is considered as "high risk" or "low risk") depends upon several factors, most usually the extent of disease when first treated.</p>

<p id="p0034" num="0034">As used herein, "delaying" the development of a PEComa means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. A method that "delays" development of a PEComa is a method that reduces probability of disease development in a given time frame and/or reduces the extent of the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects. PEComa development can be detectable using standard methods, including, but not limited to, computerized axial tomography (CAT Scan), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasound, clotting tests, arteriography, or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> biopsy.

In reference to a PEComa, an effective amount comprises an amount sufficient to cause a tumor to shrink and/or to decrease the growth rate of the tumor (such as to suppress tumor growth) or to prevent or delay other unwanted cell proliferation in a PEComa. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to delay development of a PEComa. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to prevent or delay recurrence. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. In the case of PEComas, the effective amount of the drug or composition may: (i) reduce the number of epithelioid cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent and preferably stop a PEComa cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (e.g., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence of tumor; and/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with a PEComa.</p>

Other albumins are contemplated, such as bovine serum albumin.

<p id="p0165" num="0165">The albumin (e.g., human albumin or human serum albumin) in the composition generally serves as a carrier for the mTOR inhibitor, i.e., the albumin in the composition makes the mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., sirolimus) more readily suspendable in an aqueous medium or helps maintain the suspension as compared to compositions not comprising an albumin. This can avoid the use of toxic solvents (or surfactants) for solubilizing the mTOR inhibitor, and thereby can reduce one or more side effects of administration of the mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., sirolimus) into an individual (such as a human). Thus, in some embodiments, the composition described herein is substantially free (such as free) of surfactants, such as Cremophor (or polyoxyethylated castor oil, including Cremophor EL® (BASF)). In some embodiments, the nanoparticle composition is substantially free (such as free) of surfactants. A composition is "substantially free of Cremophor" or "substantially free of surfactant" if the amount of Cremophor or surfactant in the composition is not sufficient to cause one or more side effect(s) in an individual when the nanoparticle composition is administered to the individual. In some embodiments, the nanoparticle composition contains less than about any one of 20%, 15%, 10%, 7.5%, 5%, 2.5%, or 1% organic solvent or surfactant. In some embodiments, the albumin is human albumin or human serum albumin. In some embodiments, the albumin is recombinant albumin.</p>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">The amount of an albumin in the composition described herein will vary depending on other components in the composition. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an albumin in an amount that is sufficient to stabilize the mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., sirolimus) in an aqueous suspension, for example, in the form of a stable colloidal suspension (such as a stable suspension of nanoparticles). In some embodiments, the albumin is in an amount that reduces the sedimentation rate of the mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., sirolimus) in an aqueous medium. For particle-containing compositions, the amount of the the albumin also depends on the size and density of nanoparticles of the mTOR inhibitor.<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --></p>

The suspension is generally, but not necessarily, suitable for administration to an individual (such as human). Stability of the suspension is generally (but not necessarily) evaluated at a storage temperature (such as room temperature (such as 20-25 °C) or refrigerated conditions (such as 4 °C)). For example, a suspension is stable at a storage temperature if it exhibits no flocculation or particle agglomeration visible to the naked eye or when viewed under the optical microscope at 1000 times, at about fifteen minutes after preparation of the suspension. Stability can also be evaluated under accelerated testing conditions, such as at a temperature that is higher than about 40 °C.</p>

<p id="p0181" num="0181">The methods described herein in some embodiments comprise administration of nanoparticle compositions of mTOR inhibitors. "mTOR inhibitor" used herein refers to an inhibitor of mTOR. mTOR is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway, and a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation, stress, and metabolism. mTOR pathway dysregulation has been found in many human carcinomas, and mTOR inhibition produced substantial inhibitory effects on tumor progression.

<p id="p0182" num="0182">The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (also known as mechanistic target of rapamycin or FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1)) is an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase that is present in two distinct complexes, mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (MLST8), PRAS40 and DEPTOR (<nplcit id="ncit0036" npl-type="s"><text>Kim et al. (2002). Cell 110: 163-75</text></nplcit>;<nplcit id="ncit0037" npl-type="s"><text> Fang et al. (2001). Science 294 (5548): 1942-5</text></nplcit>). mTORC1 integrates four major signal inputs: nutrients (such as amino acids and phosphatidic acid), growth factors (insulin), energy and stress (such as hypoxia and DNA damage). Amino acid availability is signaled to mTORC1 via a pathway involving the Rag and Ragulator (LAMTOR1-3) Growth factors and hormones (e.g. insulin) signal to mTORC1 via Akt, which inactivates TSC2 to prevent inhibition of mTORC1. Alternatively, low ATP levels lead to the AMPK-dependent activation of TSC2 and phosphorylation of raptor to reduce mTORC1 signaling proteins.<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --></p>
<p id="p0183" num="0183">Active mTORC1 has a number of downstream biological effects including translation of mRNA via the phosphorylation of downstream targets (4E-BP1 and p70 S6 Kinase), suppression of autophagy (Atgl3, ULK1), ribosome biogenesis, and activation of transcription leading to mitochondrial metabolism or adipogenesis. Accordingly, mTORC1 activity promotes either cellular growth when conditions are favorable or catabolic processes during stress or when conditions are unfavorable.</p>
<p id="p0184" num="0184">mTORC2 is composed of mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), GβL, and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSIN1). In contrast to mTORC1, for which many upstream signals and cellular functions have been defined (see above), relatively little is known about mTORC2 biology. mTORC2 regulates cytoskeletal organization through its stimulation of F-actin stress fibers, paxillin, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and protein kinase C α (PKCα). It had been observed that knocking down mTORC2 components affects actin polymerization and perturbs cell morphology (<nplcit id="ncit0038" npl-type="s"><text>Jacinto et al. (2004). Nat.

This suggests that mTORC2 controls the actin cytoskeleton by promoting protein kinase Cα (PKCα) phosphorylation, phosphorylation of paxillin and its relocalization to focal adhesions, and the GTP loading of RhoA and Rac1. The molecular mechanism by which mTORC2 regulates these processes has not been determined.</p>

Note that T = 0 is defined as the start of infusion, i.e., all sample collection times are relative to the start of infusion. The sample at the end of the infusion (0.5 hour) is collected immediately before the infusion is stopped. If the duration of infusion is changed, the sample should be collected immediately before termination of the infusion. Whole-blood samples will be collected in EDTA tubes for determination of rapamycin in a central laboratory.</p>
<p id="p0215" num="0215">Patients will receive ABI-009 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 2 of every 3 weeks by IV infusion over 30 minutes.

Patients will continue to therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, until in the opinion of the investigator the patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at the patients discretion.</p>
<p id="p0216" num="0216">Patients will be evaluated for complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) by CT imaging. Contrast enhanced MRI can also be used, as long as the same modality is used throughout the study. Baseline scan results can be<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> accepted from outside institutions, but must be done within 4 weeks of starting therapy and must include (as clinically indicated), chest abdominal, and pelvic CT or MRI. The first response assessment by CT or MRI scans documenting target lesions will be done 6 weeks after first treatment and should be repeated every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression. If an initial observation of objective response (CR or PR) is made, a confirmation scan should be done at 6 weeks after initial observation.</p>
<p id="p0217" num="0217">The primary endpoint, ORR, will be determined by independent radiologist(s). The independent radiologic review will follow a separate imaging charter.</p>

<p id="p0219" num="0219">Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of treatment and treatment-related adverse events (AEs), AEs of special interest, laboratory abnormalities, and incidence of patients experiencing dose modifications, dose delay/dose not given, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP due to an AE. All AEs will be recorded by the investigator from the time the patient signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP. Adverse events will be graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.</p>
<p id="p0220" num="0220">Physical examination, vital sign, laboratory assessments (eg, serum chemistry, hematology), and ECOG performance status will be monitored.

<p id="p0221" num="0221">A primary analysis will address all study objectives and it will be conducted when all patients have had the opportunity to be treated for at least 6 months. All primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted at the time of the primary analysis, with the exception of the biomarkers which may be analyzed at a later date.</p>
<p id="p0222" num="0222">The primary endpoint is ORR by independent radiologic review, and is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed PR or CR per RECIST 1.1.</p>
<p id="p0223" num="0223">This study is designed to test whether the confirmed ORR in patients treated with ABI-009 is greater than 5% as determined with the use of the exact binomial 1-sided test with type 1 error of 0.025. With approximately 30 patients the study will provide greater than 95% power to reject the null hypothesis that the ORR is ≤5% given a true response rate of 30%. In addition to<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --> the hypothesis test, the number and percentage of patients achieving ORR will be summarized and an exact 95% confidence will be provided. Assuming an observed ORR of 30%, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimated ORR will exclude values less than 14.7%.</p>
<p id="p0224" num="0224">Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints PFS, PFS rate at 6 months, DOR, and OS will be done separately for 2 subgroups of patients: 1) those with metastatic disease; and 2) those with unresectable locally advanced disease or resectable with multiple resections. Some of the patients in the locally advanced subgroup may be clinically indicated to receive surgery if there is sufficient tumor shrinkage, which would introduce a bias to the analysis.</p>
<p id="p0225" num="0225">For patients with metastatic disease, PFS at 6 months, median PFS, DOR, and OS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. Quartiles with 95% CIs will be summarized. The number of patients with unresectable locally advanced disease or resectable with multiple resections is expected to be small; therefore PFS (median and at 6 months), DOR, and OS for these patients will be summarized by descriptive statistics.</p>
<p id="p0226" num="0226">A key objective of the tumor molecular profiling is to identify specific markers that are predictive of response to ABI-009.</p>

<p id="p0228" num="0228">Tumor biopsy mutation analysis or epigenetic changes will also be completed. Archival or fresh tissue biopsies from pre-treatment tumors are required from patients on this study (mandatory). In addition, on-treatment biopsies will be performed to assess pharmacodynamic effects if available. After the last treatment and at the time of progression, if a biopsy is performed, a tumor sample will be collected. Tumor biopsies are to be collected and pharmacodynamic changes analyzed to determine the effect of the drug on target(s) in the tumor as well as to potentially analyze molecular mechanisms associated with acquired resistance. Exome sequencing using the ONCOPANEL™ test (BWH Pathology Department, CLIA certified) of approximately 300 genes will be performed to assess mutations in all the known mTOR pathway genes, including but not limited to PIK3CA, TSC1, TSC2, AKT, PTEN, MTOR, and RHEB. Evaluation of correlations of clinical response to the therapy will be conducted as well as testing the correlation between biopsy and circulating DNA analyses. FISH<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --> (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) analysis of translocations in TFE3 will be completed. These studies will be performed in the Center of Advanced Molecular Diagnostics laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, also CLIA certified.</p>
<p id="p0229" num="0229">Immunohistochemistry on relevant pathway markers, including but not limited to: phosphoproteins p-AKT, p-S6, p-S6K, p-4EBP1, and p-SPARC; proliferation markers, such as Ki-67; and apoptosis markers, such as PARP or fragments thereof, will be completed. Post-treatment (progression) samples will be analyzed by similar exome sequencing as above, to search for causes of resistance, including secondary mutations and genomic amplification or deletion events.</p>

<heading id="h0018"><b>Clinical pilot study of <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus in mTOR pathway aberrant malignancies</b></heading>
<p id="p0230" num="0230">A single-arm, phase II clinical trial is designed to assess the efficacy of <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus (also referred to as ABI-009) in an individual with a PEComa and a mutation status of an mTOR pathway gene, particularly, individuals with a mutation status of a gene that would confer sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (such as a composition comprising nanoparticles comprising a limus drug and an albumin). The gene mutation status is identified via next-generation sequencing experiments from individuals in the clinical study. A primary goal of the study is to assess the response rate of <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus in individuals with a PEComa and an mTOR-activating gene mutation status. Secondary goals are to (1) estimate time to progression and overall survival of the selected individuals; and (2) estimate an adverse events profile of <i>Nab-</i>sirolimus in the selected individuals. Additionally, correlative research is performed to assess the rate of an individual mTOR-activating gene mutation status and assess the association between the individual mTOR-activating gene mutation status and clinical outcome for individuals with a PEComa.</p>
<p id="p0231" num="0231">A single group of individuals are enrolled in the clinical study. Prior to registration, individuals are assessed in a CLIA certified lab for mTOR-activating gene mutations in at least one mTOR-associated genes selected from the group consisting of AKT1, MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3CG, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, STK11, NF1, NF2, PTEN, TP53, FGFR4, and BAP1, for example. Individuals having at least one mTOR-activating gene mutation and meeting all inclusion criteria are selected for the treatment. An archival paraffin embedded (PPFE) tissue sample may optionally be obtained from each individual. The selected individuals are<!-- EPO <DP n="86"> --> administered <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus intravenously at a dosage of about 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, or about 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus is infused over about 30 minutes during each administration. The individuals continue to receive <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus treatment and are actively monitored until the occurrence of disease progression and/or unacceptable adverse events, or until the individual refuses to receive the treatment. If multiple adverse events are observed, the dose of <i>Nab-</i> sirolimus may be interrupted or reduced to allow management of drug-related toxicities. For example, the dose of <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus may be first reduced to 56 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, and then for a second time reduced to 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Only two dose reductions are allowed per individual. Ancillary treatments, such as antiemetics, growth factors (G-CSF), bisphosphonates or denosumab for pre-existing, painful bone metastases, blood and blood products, warfarin or LMWH, and/or loperamide for diarrhea may be permitted at physician's discretion. The individuals must return to the consenting institution for treatment and evaluation at least every 28 days (or every about 25 to about 31 days) during the treatment. Biomarkers (such as sequences and levels of AKT1, MTOR, PIK3CA, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, STK11, NF1, NF2, and PTEN, and level of phosphorylated 4EBP1 and S6) are evaluated for each individual on Day 1 of cycle 1, Day 1 (± 3 days) of cycle 2, and Day 1 (± 3 days) of Cycle 3 and then every 2 cycles afterward. A blood sample is collected from each individual to analyze circulating (e.g., cell-free) DNA before and after the entire course of treatment.</p>
<p id="p0232" num="0232">Various biological samples are collected from each individual during the course of the study (e.g., before treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment), and the biological samples are used to assess the mutational status and level of relevant biomarkers. On-treatment biological samples may be collected from the individual, for example, on Day 1 of cycle 1, Day 1 (± 3 days) of cycle 2, and Day 1 (± 3 days) of Cycle 3 and then every 2 cycles afterward. A blood sample is collected from each individual before and after the treatment. A cell-free plasma DNA sample is prepared from each blood sample for assessment of circulating DNA. The cell-free plasma DNA samples are analyzed using next-generation sequencing methods to assess the prevalence of the mTOR-activating gene mutations identified in the primary tumor sample over time as a measure of response to the treatment. Additionally, fresh or archival (such as PPFE) tumor biopsy samples are collected from each individual before the treatment, and optionally during the course of the treatment (<i>i.e.</i> on-treatment). The on-treatment tumor biopsy samples are used to assess pharmacodynamics effects of <i>Nab</i>-sirolimus in the individuals. Post-treatment<!-- EPO <DP n="87"> --> tumor biopsy samples are collected from each individual at the time of disease progression after response to the treatment to assess mechanisms of resistance, including secondary mutations, genomic amplifications, or gene deletion events. Exome sequencing experiments using the ONCOPANEL™ test of approximately 300 genes are performed to assess mutations in mTOR pathway genes, including, but not limited to, PIK3CA, TSC1, TSC2, AKT, PTEN, MTOR, and RHEB. Additionally, mTOR-activating aberrations (such as sequences and levels of biomarkers, including, but not limited to, AKT1, MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3CG, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, STK11, NF1, NF2, PTEN, TP53, FGFR4, and BAP1), and level of phosphorylated AKT (i.e. p-AKT), 4EBP1 (i.e. p-4EBP1) and S6K (i.e. p-S6K) are evaluated using the tumor biopsy samples. Proliferation markers (such as Ki-67) and apoptosis markers (such as PARP) may be assessed using immunohistochemistry methods. FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) analysis of translocations in TFE3 is performed. The assessment results are used to evaluate correlation of the mTOR-activating gene mutations to clinical response to the treatment, and to test the correlation between mTOR-activating gene mutations identified in tumor biopsy samples and circulating DNA.</p>
<p id="p0233" num="0233">The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of confirmed responses. In PEComas, a confirmed response is defined to be either a CR or PR, noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart. Confirmed response will be evaluated during all cycles of treatment. An exact binomial confidence interval for the true confirmed response proportion is calculated. Secondary endpoints of this study include survival time, time to disease progression, and adverse events. The distribution of survival time and the distribution of time to disease progression are estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. For all primary and secondary endpoints, statistical analysis is carried out for the overall patient population and within each disease group.</p>
<p id="p0234" num="0234">Correlative research is performed to determine association of the treatment with quality of life and an individual mTOR-activating gene mutation status for the overall group of patients. Quality of life is assessed prior to review of treatment response and discussions of patient's general health since last treatment evaluation. Quality of life is measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30, a 30-item patient-report questionnaire about patient ability to function, symptoms related to the cancer and its treatment, overall health and quality of life, and perceived financial impact of the cancer and its treatment. Scale score trajectories of the quality of life over time are examined using stream plots and mean plots with standard deviation error bars. Changes from<!-- EPO <DP n="88"> --> baseline at each cycle is statistically tested using paired t-tests, and standardized response means is interpreted after applying Middel's (2002) adjustment using Cohen's (1988) cutoffs: &lt;0.20=trivial; 0.20-&lt;0.50=small; 0.5-&lt;0.8=moderate; and ≥0.8=large.

<heading id="h0020"><b>Treating metastatic PEComa with <i>nab</i>-sirolimus</b></heading>
<p id="p0237" num="0237">A patient with a lung PEComa (previously treated with adjuvant radiation therapy and then surgical resection of the lung PEComa about 5 months prior) presented with a new suspect metastatic lesion on CT scan. The new precarinal (mediastinal) lymph node was approximately 1.5 cm diameter. Since the size of the new lesion was borderline with respect to the entry criteria for the PEC001 (RECIST, requiring measurable disease), the patient was subject to another CT scan approximately 1 month later. At that time the lesion was measurable and the patient also had a new pleural lesion of &gt; 2cm. Given the presence of a new lesion since the last CT scan, the metastatic PEComa was considered as an aggressive tumor that was rapidly progressing. The patient was consented for the PEC001 study and treatment with <i>nab</i>-sirolimus (also referred to as ABI-009) initiated at a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given by IV infusion over 30 minutes and repeated on a 2 out of 3 week schedule. The next follow-up CT scan was scheduled after 6 weeks as per the PEC001 clinical protocol. During that period the patient received <i>nab</i>-sirolimus according to the protocol, tolerated the drug well and reported no significant adverse events. At the 6 week CT scan follow-up, the lesions showed no change from the previous scan and the disease was considered to be held stable by the treatment with <i>nab</i>-sirolimus. Further treatment and follow-up continue as per the protocol and the patient continues to tolerate the treatment with no significant adverse events.</p>
