For example, a display device may be a portable electronic device such as a smartphone or a wearable device, and the electronic modules may include an antenna module, a camera module, and a battery module. As portable electronic devices become thinner and smaller, the space available for accommodating the electronic modules is decreasing. Furthermore, as the functionality and capability of display devices improve, the number of electronic modules included in the display device increases.</p>

<heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Embodiments of the inventive concept will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals may refer to like elements throughout the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being "on", "connected to" or "coupled to" another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. Similar terms should be construed in a similar fashion.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">As used herein, the term "and/or" includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">It will be understood that, although the terms "first", "second", etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section described below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">As used herein, the singular forms, "a", "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Spatially relative terms, such as "beneath", "below", "lower", "above", and "upper", may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Similar terms should be construed in a like manner. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">It will be further understood that the terms "include" or "have", when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Herein, when one value is described as being about equal to another value or being substantially the same as or equal to another value, it is to be understood that the values are identical, the values are equal to each other within a measurement error, or if measurably unequal, are close enough in value to be functionally equal to each other as would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art. For example, the term "about" as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system). For example, "about" may mean within one or more standard deviations as understood by one of the ordinary skill in the art. Further, it is to be understood that while parameters may be described herein as having "about" a certain value, according to embodiments, the parameter may be exactly the certain value or approximately the certain value within a measurement error as would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> is a perspective view of a display device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept. <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a display device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIGs. 1A and 1B</figref>, a display device DD may be a device that is activated according to an electrical signal. For example, the display device DD may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a car navigation device, a game machine, or a wearable device, but is not limited thereto. In <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, the display device DD is exemplarily illustrated as a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The display device DD may display an image IM through a display surface DD-IS. The display surface DD-IS may include an active area DD-AA and a peripheral area DD-NAA adjacent to the active area DD-AA. The active area DD-AA may be an area in which the image IM is displayed. The peripheral area DD-NAA may be an area in which the image IM is not displayed. The image IM may include a dynamic image and a still image. A clock window and icon images are illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> as an example of the image IM.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The active area DD-AA may be parallel to a surface defined by a first direction DR1 and a second direction DR2 crossing the first direction DR1. A third direction DR3 may indicate a normal direction of the active area DD-AA, that is, a thickness direction of the display device DD.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">A front surface (or a top surface) and a rear surface (or a bottom surface) of each of members or units to be described below may be distinguished by the third direction DR3. The third direction DR3 may be a direction crossing the first direction DR1 and the second direction DR2. For example, the first direction DR1, the second direction DR2, and the third direction DR3 may be orthogonal to one another. In this specification, a surface that the first<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> direction DR1 and the second direction DR2 define may be defined as a plane, and "when viewed in a plane" may refer to being viewed in the third direction DR3.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The display device DD may include a display panel DP, an input sensor IS, and a window WP.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">The display panel DP may be a component that generates and displays the image IM. The display panel DP may be, for example, a light emitting display panel. However, the display panel DP is not particularly limited. For example, the display panel DP may be an organic light emitting display panel or a quantum dot light emitting display panel. A light emitting layer of the organic light emitting display panel may include an organic light emitting material. A light emitting layer of the quantum dot light emitting display panel may include a quantum dot and/or a quantum rod. Hereinafter the display panel DP is described as an organic light emitting display panel.</p>
