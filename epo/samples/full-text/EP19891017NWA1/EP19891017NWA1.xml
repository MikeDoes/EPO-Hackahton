<heading id="h0001"><u>FIELD</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an examination support method and an examination support system for supporting an electrocardiogram examination utilizing a wear which measures biological signals of a subject.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">An electrocardiogram is widely used in diagnosis of heart diseases such as angina (cardiac infarction) and abnormal cardiac rhythm. Heart diseases do not always appear in electrocardiograms as abnormalities. An abnormality appears in an electrocardiogram upon occurrence of an attack, and thus, an electrocardiogram when an attack does not occur cannot be distinguished from a normal electrocardiogram. Thus, an examination of taking an electrocardiogram for a long period under stress of exercise and in daily life is performed. Typically, a Holter electrocardiogram examination for 24 hours is widely performed as an electrocardiogram examination for a long period. While this electrocardiogram examination is common, missing of a heart disease is pointed out also in the electrocardiogram examination for 24 hours, and a long-term electrocardiogram examination for one week or longer is desired.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">As a method for recording an electrocardiogram comfortably and easily under a daily living environment, there is a method for putting a wear on which electrodes and measurement equipment are loaded on a subject and measuring biological signals of the subject. According to this method, the subject can be subjected to measurement for a long period equal to or longer than one week in a comfortable environment. Meanwhile, it is important to prepare a wear fitted for the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> subject. For example, in a case where a size of the wear is not fitted, electrodes are not fixed at appropriate positions with an appropriate pressure when the subject puts on the wear, which results in failing to obtain stable information with less noise. Further, in the Holter electrocardiogram examination in related art, a subject needs to visit the hospital a number of times (for example, equal to or more than four times) from when a doctor makes a diagnosis until when the subject receives feedback of an examination result, which is heavy load on the subject. Thus, an examination method with less load on the subject is desired.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a method for supporting an examination of a patient in a daily living environment, there is a support system of medical equipment disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002109073A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-109073</text></patcit>. In this system, an information provision site determines medical equipment to be provided to a patient at home on the basis of information in accordance with a result of counseling with the patient at home and transmits information regarding the determined medical equipment to a server of a medical equipment support company. The medical equipment support company specifies medical equipment to be provided to the patient at home on the basis of the information received at the server and delivers the specified medical equipment to the patient at home. In this manner, this system provides support of the medical equipment to the patient at home. However, there is no disclosure in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002109073A"><text>Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-109073</text></patcit> regarding how medical equipment suitable for the patient at home is specifically determined. Particularly, there is no disclosure regarding how an electrocardiogram examination of the patient at home is supported.</p>

<heading id="h0008"><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u></heading>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Outline of the present embodiment will be described first. A subject visits a medical institution, and a doctor diagnoses the subject. In a case where the doctor judges that the subject is suspected to have a heart disease such as angina (cardiac infarction) and abnormal cardiac rhythm, the doctor determines to perform a Holter electrocardiogram examination (hereinafter, an electrocardiogram examination) according to the present embodiment and prescribes an electrocardiogram examination. A laboratory technician measures a body size of the subject as information necessary for determining the size of the measurement wear (wear) to be put on and obtains size information on the subject including an under bust size. Health personnel (a doctor, a laboratory technician or other health personnel to whom the doctor provides directions) of the medical institution orders a wear to be put on the subject to a medical equipment sales agency using an information processing apparatus. The health personnel also notifies the size information on the subject upon ordering. The agency determines a wear of a size appropriate for the subject on the basis of the size information on the subject and sends the determined wear of the size to the subject along with an<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> instruction manual. The subject who has received the wear puts on the wear along the instruction manual and measures biological signals (electrocardiogram signals) during a measurement period (for example, one week). After the measurement period, the subject sends back the wear which the subject has put on to the medical equipment sales agency. The medical equipment sales agency reads out measurement data from measurement equipment (cardiography equipment) loaded on the wear and requests analysis of the readout measurement data to an electrocardiographic analysis institution. The electrocardiographic analysis institution analyzes the measurement data and creates an analysis report. The medical institution receives the analysis report from the electrocardiographic analysis institution, and the doctor diagnoses a state of the subject using the analysis report.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">The present embodiment provides an examination support method and an examination support system for efficiently performing a series of procedure regarding an electrocardiogram examination as described above while reducing load on a subject.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an entire configuration of an examination support system according to the present embodiment. The examination support system in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes an information processing apparatus 100 disposed at a medical institution, an order reception apparatus 200, a data processing apparatus 300 and an inventory management apparatus 400 disposed at a medical equipment sales agency, an analysis apparatus 500 disposed at an analysis center, a communication terminal 600 of the subject and a communication network 700.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The medical institution is an institution which provides medical service including an electrocardiogram examination, and the like, to the subject. As an example, the medical institution is a hospital, and the subject is a patient who is to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> undergo an electrocardiogram examination. A doctor diagnoses the subject, and in a case where the doctor judges that the subject is suspected to have a heart disease such as abnormal cardiac rhythm, the doctor determines to perform an electrocardiogram examination and prescribes the electrocardiogram examination.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The electrocardiogram examination uses a measurement wear (hereinafter, a wear) on which measurement equipment (cardiography equipment) which measures action potential or an action current of cardiac muscle associated with beat of a heart as a biological signal of the subject is loaded. The subject puts on the wear during a measurement period. The measurement period is determined by the doctor and is approximately from one to two weeks as an example. Measurement data recorded by the cardiography equipment is called an electrocardiogram. To order a wear to be put on the subject, a laboratory technician measures the body size of the subject as information necessary for determining the size of the wear. However, the measurement may be performed by the doctor or other health personnel to whom the doctor provides directions. Further, measurement may be performed using a measurement apparatus which automatically measures the body size, or the laboratory technician, or the like, may manually measure the body size using a measuring tape.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Measurement items of the body size include a body height, a chest measurement, under bust, a shoulder width, a sitting height, a body weight, and the like. The measurement items do not have to include all of these and may include other items. However, it is assumed in the present embodiment that the measurement items include at least under bust.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Here, a wear to be used in the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of a wear 1. <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a view of a reverse side (side in contact with the skin) of a front body of the wear 1. The wear 1 includes cardiography equipment 10 which is measurement equipment, electrodes 20, 21 and 22<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (<figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>), and a wear body portion 30. Medical equipment in the present embodiment includes the cardiography equipment 10 and the electrodes 20, 21 and 22.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The wear body portion 30 includes a front body 31 and a rear body 32. The front body 31 is connected to the rear body 32 with two shoulder belts (shoulder straps) 33 illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, and the front body 31 is separated from the rear body 32 at both sides (side portions). The cardiography equipment 10 is loaded at the center of a torso portion of the front body 31. On the rear side of the torso portion of the front body 31 on which the cardiography equipment 10 is loaded, electrodes 20, 21 and 22 (<figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>) which make contact with the skin of the subject are attached.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">These electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are arranged on the basis of CC5 which is one of induction methods of the Holter electrocardiogram examination. The cardiography equipment 10 and the electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are located around the under bust of the wearer when the wearer puts on the wear. The electrode 20 becomes a positive electrode, the electrode 21 becomes a negative electrode, and the electrode 22 becomes an earth electrode. The electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are constituted with conductive fiber as an example. However, the electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are not limited to conductive fiber, and may be adhesive films including a conductive material. A size and a shape of the electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are not particularly limited as long as the electrodes can detect biological signals. While not illustrated, the respective electrodes 20, 21 and 22 are connected to a connector 37 (see <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>) of the cardiography equipment 10 with a lead line. These wiring portions are covered with an electronic insulating member 23.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The electrodes 20, 21 and 22 may be detachable from the front body 31. Further, the cardiography equipment 10 may be detachable from the wear body portion 30 via the connector 37 (see <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>). By detaching at least the cardiography equipment 10 among the cardiography equipment 10 and the electrodes 20 to 22 from the wear body portion 30,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> it is possible to wash the wear. As the connector 37, a socket, or the like, which is typically used in connection of cords can be used as an example. A plurality of metal dot buttons which can fix the cardiography equipment 10 at the wear body portion 30 at the same time may be used.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The cardiography equipment 10 includes a chargeable battery and can record electrocardiogram data (measurement data) for one or two weeks, or more weeks without being additionally charged, in a state where the battery is fully charged. The cardiography equipment 10 includes a storage which can store all data measured during one or two weeks or more weeks. The cardiography equipment 10 includes a communication device which performs communication with apparatuses such as a computer wiredly or wirelessly. The communication device has a function of connecting with the apparatus wiredly or wirelessly and transmitting the measurement data stored in the storage to the apparatus. Further, the cardiography equipment 10 includes a display 11 which displays data. The cardiography equipment 10 can display an operation state of the cardiography equipment 10 at the display 11 during operation. The subject can grasp whether or not the cardiography equipment 10 normally operates, that is, whether or not measurement is normally performed by confirming the display 11 during the measurement period.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">At the torso portion of the front body 31, a hook and loop fastener B side (loop side) 40 is sewed so that a flat rubber embedded in the rear body 32 can be fixed with an equal extension degree in accordance with the size of the under bust of the wearer. Further, side tabs 36 are attached at both ends of the torso portion of the rear body 32. The front body 31 is connected to the rear body 32 at both sides (side portions) by a hook and loop fastener A side (hook side) provided on a rear side of the side tabs 36 being fixed with the hook and loop fastener B side 40 of the front body 31. When the hook and loop fastener A side is fixed, the side tabs 36 are located around<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the under bust. The hook and loop fastener A side and the hook and loop fastener B side 40 function as a size adjustment mechanism for adjusting a pressure when the subject puts on the wear. While the present embodiment includes two right and left size adjustment mechanisms, the number of size adjustment mechanisms may be one or three or more.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">A plurality of stitches 41 are provided on the hook and loop fastener B side 40 at intervals to make it easier to understand fastened positions of the side tabs 36. The stitches 41 correspond to scales indicating candidates for fastened positions of the side tabs 36 (adjustment positions for positioning). However, the side tabs 36 do not have to be fastened at the positions of scales and may be fastened at positions between scales. Further, one stitch 41 may be provided instead of a plurality of stitches 41 being provided. The stitches 41 are constituted with colored yarn different from color of the hook and loop fastener B side 40 as an example.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">An interval of scales is equal to or greater than 1 cm and equal to or less than 8 cm at each of the right and left size adjustment mechanisms as an example. In a case where there is one size adjustment mechanism, the interval of scales is equal to or greater than 2 cm and equal to or less than 16 cm as an example.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of the hook and loop fastener (B side) of the front body 31. <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a wear of M size which is to be applied to a size of the under bust of the subject from 80 cm to 100 cm. The subject fastens tips of the side tabs 36 at appropriate positions (fastened positions) in accordance with the size of the under bust. For example, in a case where the size of the under bust of the subject is 90 cm, the subject fastens the tips of the right and left side tabs 36 so as to be respectively aligned with positions of the second stitches from the connector 37 of the cardiography equipment 10. Further, in a case where the size of the under bust is 87 cm, the subject fastens the tips of the side tabs 36 so as to be aligned with positions moved from<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> positions of the first stitches to the second stitches by 1 cm. In the present embodiment, the wear is provided to the subject in a state where the fastened positions are marked (see <figref idref="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> which will be described later) so as to prevent the subject from fastening the tips of the side tabs 36 at wrong positions or to prevent the subject from forgetting the fastened positions.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a rear view of the wear 1. A flat rubber is embedded into the torso portion 34 of the rear body 32 as an elastic body 35. As an example, by setting a length of the elastic body 35 at equal to or higher than 30% and equal to or less than 60% of the under bust of the subject, it is possible to acquire biological signals while the electrodes 20, 21 and 22 supported at the wear body portion 30 make contact with the skin of the subject with an appropriate pressure, that is, without the subject feeling strong compression by putting on the wear. Further, the elastic body 35 is approximately from 25 mm to 50 mm wide as an example. The elastic body 35 requires force equal to or greater than 3N and equal to or less than 9N to extend in a long axis direction by 30% as an example. Further, the elastic body 35 requires force equal to or greater than 2N and equal to or less than 6N to extend in the long axis direction by 20% as an example.</p>

<p id="p0052" num="0052">While the size of the wear and the fastened positions of the side tabs have been determined on the basis of the under bust size here, a determination method is not limited to this. For example, the size of the wear and the fastened positions of the side tabs may be determined further using at least one of a<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> body height, a chest measurement, a sitting height and a body weight of the subject. For example, the size of the wear and the fastened positions of the side tabs may be calculated on the basis of the under bust and the chest measurement. As described above, the size is not limited to S, M and L, and more or less sizes may be provided.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Further, the size of the wear and the fastened positions of the side tabs may be determined by the staff. In this case, the staff determines the size of the wear and the fastened positions of the side tabs from the above-described correspondence information on the basis of the under bust size of the subject. The staff inputs values of the determined wear size and fastened positions in the fields 213 and 214.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">After the values of the wear size and the fastened positions are stored in the fields 213 and 214, a shipment screen for performing shipment procedure is displayed by the staff clicking the shipment button 212.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an example of the shipment screen.

<p id="p0056" num="0056">After the staff confirms the wear size and the fastened positions of the side tabs optimal for the subject, the staff operates the inventory management apparatus 400 to confirm whether or not the wear of the size is left in stock. The inventory management apparatus 400 is an apparatus for managing inventory of the wears which are stored for each size within a warehouse 401. The inventory management apparatus 400 is a computer including an input apparatus, a display apparatus, a processor such as a CPU and a communication apparatus. The staff picks up the wear of the size of the subject from the warehouse 401 after confirming whether or not the wear is left in stock and marks the fastened positions for the subject on the wear. The fastened positions may be<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> marked with a felt pen, with yarn of specific color, with an arrow mark or using other methods.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057"><figref idref="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example where the positions of the second stitches (P<sub>M</sub>6) on the wear of the size M illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> are marked. Marks 42 are provided at the second stitches.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">The fastened positions may be marked with machine which is prepared for marking as well as being marked by the staff. For example, data indicating the fastened positions are input to the machine, and the wear on which the marks are to be provided is placed at the machine. The machine automatically provides marks on the wear by the staff giving a marking instruction to the machine. The data indicating the fastened positions may be automatically input to the machine by the machine being made to coordinate with the order reception apparatus 200 or the inventory management apparatus 400.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The wears on which the respective fastened positions (P<sub>S</sub>1 to P<sub>S</sub>21 in a case of the S size, P<sub>M</sub>1 to P<sub>M</sub>21 in a case of the M size, and P<sub>L</sub>1 to P<sub>L</sub>21 in a case of the L size) are marked may be prepared in advance and stored in the warehouse 401. In this case, the staff only requires to pick up the wear of the size of the subject, on which the fastened positions determined for the subject are marked from the warehouse 401.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">While the order reception apparatus 200 and the inventory management apparatus 400 are separately provided in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the order reception apparatus 200 and the inventory management apparatus 400 may be integrated by the functions of the inventory management apparatus 400 being added to the order reception apparatus 200. Further, the inventory management apparatus 400 does not have to be provided.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">The staff packages the electrocardiogram measurement set including the wear on which the marks are provided, the instruction manual, and the like, and sends the set to the subject at shipment address of the subject. The set may be sent by courier or by mail or other ways. Note that an invoice to be pasted on the package may be automatically printed by<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> the shipment application, the wear selection application, or the like, outputting shipment information on the subject to a printer at a predetermined timing (for example, at a timing at which a shipment instruction is given) or may be created through operation by the operator.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">While the staff picks up the wear from the warehouse and packages and sends the wear here, all or part of these series of operation can be automatically performed by utilizing a drone or an autonomous driving car.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">For example, an automated conveyance apparatus (which may be a mobile robot, a belt conveyer or other types of apparatuses) which coordinates with the order reception apparatus 200 or the inventory management apparatus 400 may be provided in the warehouse 401 and may be caused to convey wears in the warehouse 401. For example, in a case where the shipment button 212 is clicked on the wear selection screen, a conveyance instruction is transmitted from the order reception apparatus 200 to the automated conveyance apparatus directly or via the inventory management apparatus 400 at the same time or before or after the shipment screen is displayed. The automated conveyance apparatus automatically picks up the wear of the size designated in the conveyance instruction from a shelf on which wears are stored for each size and places the wear to a predetermined location. The staff picks up the wear from the predetermined location.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Further, in a case where wears with marks are stored, the automated conveyance apparatus automatically passes the conveyed wear to an automated packaging apparatus. The automated packaging apparatus packages the wear and creates and pastes an invoice. The automated packaging apparatus passes the package to an automated transfer apparatus (such as a drone and an autonomous driving car) and the automated transfer apparatus automatically sends the package to the shipment address of the subject. The shipment address may be transmitted from the inventory management apparatus 400 or the order reception apparatus 200 to the automated transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> apparatus or may be read by the automated transfer apparatus from the invoice. There are various possible methods for sending the wear to the subject after the wear size and the fastened positions optimal for the subject are determined in this manner, and any method may be used.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">The subject receives the electrocardiogram measurement set sent from the medical equipment sales agency. The subject puts on the wear in accordance with the instruction manual included in the package and explanation received from the health personnel (such as the doctor and the laboratory technician) of the medical institution in advance and records an electrocardiogram. For example, the subject puts on the wear directly on the skin of the upper body and aligns the tips of the side tabs with the marked positions to thereby fix the wear on the body.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066"><figref idref="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> is a view of the subject seen from a diagonally forward right direction when the subject puts on the wear 1. <figref idref="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a rear view of the subject seen from a diagonally backward left direction when the subject puts on the wear 1. Misalignment of the wear body portion 30 is prevented because the front body 31 is connected to the rear body 32 with the shoulder belt 33. The wear of the size appropriate for the subject is provided, and the subject fixes the tips of the side tabs at appropriate fastened positions, so that the electrodes 20, 21 and 22 (<figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>) make contact with the skin of the subject with an appropriate pressure. The subject therefore does not feel strong compression by putting on the wear. This enables the subject to record an electrocardiogram in a comfortable environment and enables biological signals of the subject to be acquired at an appropriate level which allows correct electrocardiographic analysis. Further, marking of the fastened positions allows the subject to easily understand the positions where the side tabs 36 are to be fastened.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The subject activates the cardiography equipment by powering on the cardiography equipment before or after putting on the wear. By this means, measurement is started. The<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> measurement is performed for a measurement period (for example, one week) determined on the basis of the diagnosis by the doctor. The subject keeps the wear on and intermittently performs measurement except a limited period while the subject changes his/her clothes, takes a bath, or the like. In a case where the cardiography equipment and the electrodes are detachable from the wear, the subject may detach the cardiography equipment and the electrodes from the wear and may wash or clean a wear portion.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The subject has the communication terminal 600. The communication terminal 600 is a terminal such as a smartphone, a mobile phone, a tablet terminal, a notebook personal computer (PC) and a desktop PC. The subject may contact the health personnel (such as the doctor and the laboratory technician) of the medical institution or the staff of the medical equipment sales agency using the communication terminal 600 by email, by phone, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The subject returns the wear which the subject has put on to the medical equipment sales agency after the measurement period. The wear may be returned using a method designated by the medical equipment sales agency in advance such as by mail or by courier. In a similar manner to a case where the wear is sent to the subject, the wear may be returned using a drone, an autonomous driving car, or the like. The cardiography equipment may have a built-in timer, sound source and speaker, and may notify end of the measurement period to the subject with the timer. In place of or in addition to the sound source and the speaker, the cardiography equipment may include a vibrator and may notify end of the measurement period to the subject by driving the vibrator. The subject makes settings of the timer upon start of measurement as an example. Further, information on the measurement period may be notified from the information processing apparatus 100 to the order reception apparatus 200, and instructions which describe the measurement period may be included in the electrocardiogram measurement set sent to the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> subject. In a case where a duration of the measurement period is determined in advance, operation of notifying the information on the measurement period from the information processing apparatus 100 to the order reception apparatus 200 is not required.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">The data processing apparatus 300 of the medical equipment sales agency includes an input device 301, a display 302, a storage 303, a communication device 304, a reader 305, and an analysis request device 306. A hardware configuration of the data processing apparatus 300 is similar to that of a typical computer including a processor such as a CPU, a storage apparatus, a display apparatus, an input apparatus, a communication interface, and the like. The data processing apparatus 300 may be the same hardware apparatus as the order reception apparatus 200 or the inventory management apparatus 400 or may be a hardware apparatus different from the order reception apparatus 200 or the inventory management apparatus 400. The data processing apparatus 300 is operated by the staff of the medical equipment sales agency.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">The input device 301, the display 302, the storage 303, and the communication device 304 have functions similar to those of the input device, the display, the storage and the communication device of the information processing apparatus 100 or the order reception apparatus 200 except content or a type of data or application to be dealt with.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">The staff connects the cardiography equipment loaded on the wear returned from the subject to the reader 305 wiredly or wirelessly and causes the reader 305 to read out measurement data (electrocardiogram data) stored in the cardiography equipment. The reader 305 writes the read measurement data in the storage 303 as an electrocardiographic file. Further, the reader 305 may write the read data in a computer readable recording medium. Examples of the recording medium can include a CD-R, a USB memory, an SSD, a memory card, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">There are various configurations where the reader 305<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> reads out measurement data from the cardiography equipment. For example, the measurement data may be read out from the cardiography equipment through wireless local area network (LAN) communication, Bluetooth, near field communication, or the like. Further, the reader 305 may be connected to the cardiography equipment wiredly using a serial cable, or the like, and the measurement data may be transmitted from the cardiography equipment to the reader 305 through serial transfer.
