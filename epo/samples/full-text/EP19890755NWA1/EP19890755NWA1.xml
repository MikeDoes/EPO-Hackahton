<heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention belongs to the field of medicine, and relates to a pyrimido five-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycle derivative, a method for preparing the same, and a use thereof in medicine. In particular, the present invention relates to a pyrimido five-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycle derivative of formula (I), a method for preparing the same, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same, a use thereof as a SHP2 inhibitor, and a use thereof in the preparation of a medicament for preventing and/or treating tumor or cancer.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Src homology domain 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) is an evolutionarily conserved non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by the PTPN11 gene. SHP2 is mainly composed of two SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) and one PTP catalytic domain. SHP2 is widely expressed in various human tissues, and plays an important role in maintaining tissue development, cell homeostasis and the like. SHP2 is related to signals through the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, JAK-STAT or phosphoinositide 3-kinase AKT pathway. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene and subsequent mutations in SHP2 have been identified in a variety of human diseases, such as Noonan syndrome, Leopard syndrome, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, neuroblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer (same as Claim19). Therefore, SHP2 represents a highly attractive target for the development of new therapies for treating various diseases.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Published patent applications related to the SHP2 target include <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2018136264A"><text>WO2018136264A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2015003094A"><text>WO2015003094A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2018160731A"><text>WO2018160731A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2018130928A1"><text>WO2018130928A1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2018136265A"><text>WO2018136265A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2018172984A"><text>WO2018172984A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2018081091A"><text>WO2018081091</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO2016203405A"><text>WO2016203405</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO2017211303A"><text>WO2017211303A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO2018013597A"><text>WO2018013597A</text></patcit> and the like. At present, the SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 developed by Novartis and the SHP2 inhibitor JAB-3068 developed by JACOBIO are both in the phase I clinical trial, and there is no marketed product on this target. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to develop novel SHP2 inhibitors with higher effcacy in order to provide patients with new and effective anti-cancer drugs.</p>

The cell culture was stopped with cell lysate. The level of phosphorylated ERK in KYSE-520 cells was determined by a method based on homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence HTRF (Cisbio, 64ERKPEG). The fluorescence values (Ex337nm/Em625/665nm) were read on the compatible HTRF reader (MD SpectraMax).

<p id="p0249" num="0249">KYSE-520 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were adhered (600 cells/well) in 1640 medium containing 10% of FBS in a 96-well plate overnight, and then treated with a series of concentrations of the test compound (10 µM, 3 µM, 1 µM, 0.3 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.03 µM, 0.01 µM, 0.003 µM, 0.001 µM). The treated cell plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 7 days. CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G7573) was used to determine the number of viable cells in each well of the treated plate. 100 µL of the detection reagent was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then, the fluorescence signal in each well was measured with Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). The IC<sub>50</sub> value of KYSE-520 proliferation inhibition was calculated using the four-parameter logit method. In the following formula, x represents the logarithmic form of the compound concentration, and F(x) represents the effect value (the inhibition rate of cell proliferation under the given concentration condition): F(x) = ((A-D)/(1+ ((x/C) ^B))) + D. A, B, C and D are four parameters. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was further calculated as the compound concentration required for 50% proliferation inhibition in the best-fit curve with Primer premier 6.0.

<p id="p0251" num="0251">In this experiment, whole-cell current recording was performed using a manual patch clamp system (HEKA EPC-10 signal amplification and digital conversion system, purchased from HEKA Electronic, Germany). The round glass slide of which surface CHO hERG cells (provided by Sophion Bioscience Inc., Denmark, the cell generation number was P21) were grown on was placed in an electrophysiological recording slot under an inverted microscope. The recording slot was continuously perfused with extracellular fluid (approximately 1 mL per minute). Conventional whole-cell patch clamp current recording technique was used in the experiment. The experiments were performed at normal room temperature (∼25 °C). The cells were clamped at a voltage of -80 mV. Cell patch clamp voltage was depolarized to +20 mV to activate hERG potassium channel, and to -50 mV after 5 seconds to eliminate inactivation and generate tail currents. The tail current peak was used as a value of hERG current. When the hERG potassium current recorded in the above steps became steady under continuous perfusion of the extracellular fluid in the recording slot, the drug to be tested could be added to the perfusion, until the inhibition effect of the drug on hERG current reached a steady state. Generally, the overlapping of most recent three consecutive current recording lines was used as a criterion to determine whether the state was stable. After reaching the steady state, the recording slot was perfused with extracellular fluid until the hERG current returned to the value before the drug adding. The test data was analyzed by HEKA Patchmaster (V2x73.2), Microsoft Excel and the data analysis software provided by Graphpad Prism 5.0.<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> -->
