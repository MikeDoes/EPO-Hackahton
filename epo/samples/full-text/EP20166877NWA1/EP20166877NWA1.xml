<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention pertains generally to the field of gas selective separation filters, in particular useful for gas mixture separation, notably in the context of carbon capture resulting from the separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> and hydrocarbons, for instance from gas waste or effluents. The invention more specifically relates to filters using atom-thick graphene porous membranes.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In the frame of addressing the global warming issues and identified contributing factors, one option that has been developed is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the capture of carbon dioxide from gaseous streams followed by underground sequestration. Carbon capture and storage is a strategy for mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from large point sources, such as coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">However, molecular separation, a key component of industrial processes and at the heart of environmental issues like carbon capture, is highly energy-intensive <i>(</i><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Sholl et al., 2016, Nature. 532, 435-437</text></nplcit><i>).</i> The energy-efficiency and capital cost of the separation processes can be substantially reduced by using high-performance molecular-sieving membranes separating gases based on their kinetic diameter (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Ma et al., 2018, Science, 361, 1008-1011</text></nplcit><i>;</i> <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Zhou et al., 2018, Sci.

<p id="p0004" num="0004">Gas-sieving nanoporous single-layer graphene (N-SLG), prepared by incorporating vacancy defects in the single-layer graphene (SLG) lattice, is highly promising for high flux gas separation because the diffusion resistance is controlled by a single transition state at the nanopore <i>(</i><nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Jiang et al., 2009, Nano Lett., 9, 4019-24</text></nplcit><i>;</i> <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Celebi et al., 2014, Science, 344, 289-292</text></nplcit><i>;</i> <nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="s"><text>Song et al., 2013, Science, 342, 95-98</text></nplcit><i>).</i> However, with state-of-the-art etching techniques <i>(</i><nplcit id="ncit0011" npl-type="s"><text>Wang et al., 2017, Nat. Nanotechnol., 12, 509-522</text></nplcit><i>),</i> it is difficult to incorporate vacancy defects that can sieve similarly-sized molecules, mainly because nucleation and growth of vacancy defects is not controlled to the extent needed for the incorporation of narrow pore-size-distribution.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Molecular sieving resolution (MSR), defined as the difference in the kinetic diameters of molecules to be separated, of 0.2 Å has been predicted from the vacancy-incorporated lattice,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> allowing the separation of industrially-relevant mixtures such as CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (<nplcit id="ncit0012" npl-type="s"><text>Liu et al., 2015, J.

Sci., 268, 325-332</text></nplcit>) and controlled expansion of the vacancy defects remains a bottleneck. Commercial membranes (Polaris™), based on polymeric thin film composites, have generally a CO<sub>2</sub> permeance of about 1'000 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35 × 10<sup>-10</sup> mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup>) and a CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of about 50 (<nplcit id="ncit0019" npl-type="s"><text>Merkel et al., 2010, J.

<p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, the development of new methods of fabricating graphene membranes that possess size-selective pores with a narrow pore-size-distribution is highly attractive in view of the largescale deployment of the nanoporous two-dimensional membranes that has been hampered so far by the above described technical limitations.</p>

Using a premade porous film avoids polymer solution-induced contaminations in the surface of nanoporous graphene. Such contaminations are difficult to avoid when directly forming the porous film on top of graphene (<nplcit id="ncit0026" npl-type="s"><text>He et al., 2019, Energy Environ.

The thin porous polymer reinforcement layer was made of a thermally resistant polybenzimidazole copolymer (fumion® AM provided by FUMATECH BWT GmbH, Germany) which can be carbonized once it sits on top of nanoporous graphene to form a thermally conductive carbon porous reinforcement ideal for Ac-HRTEM imaging.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">The polybenzimidazole copolymer was processed into a porous thin film using non-solvent induced phase separation. Briefly, a drop of a 1.5 wt. % solution of the polymer in DMAc was spread on top of a 25 µm Cu foil by gently pressed it with a glass slide. The Cu foil coated with the thin polymer solution was immersed in an IPrOH bath to precipitate the polymer solution layer into a thin porous polymer film. After drying the porous polymer film, the Cu foil was etched in a 20 wt. % sodium persulfate aqueous bath and the remaining floating polybenzimidazole copolymer porous film was transferred to a water bath to remove the sodium persulfate. The floating polybenzimidazole copolymer porous film was scooped from the water bath using the Cu foil with nanoporous graphene on its surface. After the porous film completely dried on top of the nanoporous graphene, a drop of IPrOH was poured on it to enhance the adhesion of the polymer film to the nanoporous graphene surface upon evaporation of the IPrOH. Subsequently, the porous polymer film was pyrolyzed at 500 °C in the flow of H<sub>2</sub>/Ar, leading to the formation of nanoporous graphene reinforced by a porous carbon. Next, the Cu foil was etched in a 20 wt% sodium persulfate bath and the resulting reinforced nanoporous graphene was washed with water and transferred to a 400-mesh gold TEM grid. Finally, the TEM grid loaded with the reinforced nanoporous graphene was cleaned inside activated carbon at 900 °C for one hour in the presence of H<sub>2</sub> to remove contaminations covering the nanopores. Nanoporous graphene adsorbs contaminations easily, hence the cleaning at 900 °C in H<sub>2</sub> is crucial to expose most of the nanopores prior to the imaging session. The cleaning was done taking the following precautions to avoid the presence of O<sub>2</sub> in the system which could enlarge the pores: (i) Adsorbed O<sub>2</sub> was removed prior to heating to high temperatures by evacuating the system three times and applying a vacuum of ca. 2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> Torr at 200 °C for 2 h. (ii) Prior to heating to 900 °C the system was pressurized to ca. 850 Torr with a constant flow of H<sub>2</sub> to avoid O<sub>2</sub> leak. The system was kept<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> pressurized at ca. 850 Torr under a constant flow of H<sub>2</sub> for the rest of the cleaning procedure.

<p id="p0116" num="0116">Single-component and mixture gas permeation tests were carried out in a permeation module as described on <figref idref="f0009"><b>Figure 6</b></figref><b>.</b> All the permeation tests were conducted in the open-end mode. All equipment used in the permeation setup (the mass flow controllers (MFCs), oven and MS) were calibrated within a 5% error. The ozone treated graphene membranes obtained as described under Example 1 was sandwiched in the VCR-based module (Swagelok VCR fittings), making a leaktight fitting. The feed and the sweep lines were preheated inside the oven to prevent temperature fluctuation. A pre-calibrated MFC regulated the flow rate of the feed gas, where the feed pressure (1.5 - 2.0 bar) was adjusted by the back-pressure regulator. Another pre-calibrated MFC controlled the flow rate of sweep gas (Ar) with 1 bar pressure, which carried the permeate gas to the pre-calibrated mass spectrometer (MS) for real-time analysis of the permeate concentration. The MS was pre-calibrated at similar concentrations in the permeate stream of He, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> in Ar. Before testing, all membranes were heated to 100 °C to remove the contaminations on the graphene surface. For the mixture permeation tests, an equimolar gas mixture or specific concentration (20% CO<sub>2</sub>, 80% N<sub>2</sub>) was used on the feed side. The measurements were carried out at continuously, in real-time, and only the steady-state data were reported. The gas flux was calculated once the steady-state was established.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">Gas flux was observed through 1-mm<sup>2</sup>-sized ozone treated graphene membranes prepared according to a method of the invention using O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 3.2 × 10<sup>16</sup> to 3.5 × 10<sup>17</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s (τ = 0.01 - 0.2 s), revealed that H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> can be separated from CH<sub>4</sub>, with H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> permeances increasing monotonically by 30-fold at the highest O<sub>3</sub> dose <b>(</b><figref idref="f0010"><b>Figure 7A</b></figref><b>).</b> The H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivities (9.7 - 19.9 and 6.1 - 16.5, respectively), were much higher than the corresponding Knudsen selectivities (2.8 and 0.6, respectively), confirming that the incorporated vacancy defects could indeed advantageously sieve similarly-sized molecules. Interestingly, the activation energy for H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>, extracted by subtracting their heat of adsorption (2.7, 9.9, and 8.7 kJ/mole, respectively) from the observed apparent activation energy, did not change<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> significantly <b>(</b><figref idref="f0010"><b>Figure 7B</b></figref><b>).</b> The decrease in selectivity at higher dosage can be attributed to the coalescence of adjacent pores, which is expected to promote the effusive transport.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">Hindering the etching reactor with the synchronized Ar purge (<i>t<sub>d</sub></i> = 0 - 1.0 s) (10 bar) improved the CO<sub>2</sub>-sieving performance <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 7C</b></figref><b>)</b> CO<sub>2</sub> permeance of 2'620 GPU with corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivities of 27.6 and 20.0 could be achieved at O<sub>3</sub> dose of 1.6 × 10<sup>17</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s (τ =0.1 s, <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> = 0.5 s), proving that the collection of nanopores observed by Ac-HRTEM is indeed attractive for CO<sub>2</sub>-sieving. The rapid removal of residual O<sub>3</sub> by the Ar purge was also reflected in the fact that a relatively lower structural disorder was observed by the Raman spectroscopy. The use of purge improved CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity without a significant loss in CO<sub>2</sub> permeance <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 7C</b></figref><b>).</b> The sieving of CO<sub>2</sub> from N<sub>2</sub> corresponds to a MSR of 0.3 Å and a CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> selectivity of 12.6 could be achieved which corresponds to a MSR of 0.2 Å.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">The etching kinetics could be controlled to yield attractive CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivities at a wide range of reactor temperatures (i.e. 120 - 290 °C) with optimized O<sub>3</sub> dosages <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 7D</b></figref> <b>&amp;</b> <figref idref="f0016"><b>10</b></figref><b>).</b> For a given ozone dose (τ =0.1 s, <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> = 0.5 s), increasing gas permeance and decreasing selectivity was observed as a function of the etching temperature, attributing to a faster etching kinetics at the higher temperature. This was evidenced in HRTEM-derived PSD where the mean pore size (edge to edge gap) increased by ca. 0.2 nm at 290 °C (<figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 7E</b></figref>). The mean pore size at 290 °C could be reduced by optimizing the O<sub>3</sub> dose by reducing <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> from 0.5 to 0.2 s and using a pressurized He purge as purge system. This was reflected in the improvements in the H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivities <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 7D</b></figref><b>).</b></p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">The method of the invention has a unique advantage that one can adjust the molecular cut-off for a specific molecular-sieving application.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">This is further supported by expanding vacancy defects using O<sub>2</sub> at 200 °C <i>in-situ.</i> Briefly, the feed side of the ozone treated graphene membrane of the invention was pressurized with CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixture while the permeate side was swept with Ar, and a steady-state operation was achieved. To initiate the etching, the sweep gas was switched to O<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> in the permeate side was tracked as a function of time using an online mass spectrometer. After the reactor, the sweep was switched back to Ar to measure the state-state permeation data.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">Upon O<sub>2</sub> exposure at 200 °C, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the permeate side increased as a function of time <b>(</b><figref idref="f0012"><b>Figure 8A</b></figref><b>).</b> However, the increase in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was much more rapid which resulted in the improvement of CO<sub>2</sub> permeance as well as CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity <b>(</b><figref idref="f0012"><b>Figure 8B</b></figref> <b>&amp;</b> <figref idref="f0013"><b>C</b></figref><b>).</b> The improvement in the performance was permanent and could be observed after<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> several cycles of testing over several days. Repeating O<sub>2</sub>-based pore expansion, on the same graphene membrane after several days, led to further improvement in CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity <b>(</b><figref idref="f0012"><b>Figure 8A</b></figref> &amp; <figref idref="f0013"><b>C</b></figref><b>).</b> The pore expansion was confirmed by the reduced apparent activation energy of all gas molecules (2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for H<sub>2</sub>, and 4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for other gases, <figref idref="f0013"><b>Figure 8D</b></figref><b>).</b></p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">The slow pore expansion with O<sub>2</sub> could shift the molecular cutoff by ca. 0.1 Å, consistent with etching kinetics of graphite with O<sub>2</sub> at 200 °C. Assuming first-order kinetics with O<sub>2</sub>, an etching rate constant of 1.6 × 10<sup>-7</sup> nm min<sup>-1</sup> Torr<sup>-1</sup> was estimated at these conditions <i>(</i><nplcit id="ncit0032" npl-type="s"><text>Chu et al., 1992, Surf.

Chem. Phys. 75, 4471-4476</text></nplcit><i>).</i> As a result, the pore expansion for 1-2 h favored O<sub>2</sub> permeation, reducing CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> selectivity from 12.6 to 7.4, and increasing O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity from 1.6 to 3.4 <b>(</b><figref idref="f0013"><b>Figure 8C</b></figref><b>).</b> Combined with O<sub>2</sub> permeance of 1'300 GPU, it makes gas selective separation filters of the invention attractive for the decentralized small-scale applications such as hospitals where O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation is needed for enriching O<sub>2</sub>. In the context of post-combustion capture, the shifted cutoff allowed us to realize extremely attractive CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation performance with CO<sub>2</sub> permeance and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of 9'600 GPU and 24.4, respectively <b>(</b><figref idref="f0014"><b>Figure 8E</b></figref><b>).</b> Another membrane treated by MGR (250 °C, 1.6 × 10<sup>17</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s (τ =0.1 s, <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> = 0.5 s Ar)) yielded CO<sub>2</sub> permeance of 11' 850 GPU and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of 21.7 after 1 h O<sub>2</sub> treatment. The CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation performance was similar to that from the single component with the mixture separation factor slightly higher than the corresponding ideal selectivity <b>(</b><figref idref="f0015"><b>Figure 9</b></figref><b>),</b> which can be attributed to competitive adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">Overall, those data support that a method of the invention allows the controlled incorporation of vacancy-defects in graphene membrane by limiting the O<sub>3</sub> exposure time to few milliseconds. The PSD in graphene can be tuned by the O<sub>3</sub> dose and by a slow expansion in O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere after ozone treatment (The graphene membrane treated by MGR was exposed to 200 °C O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 1-2 h to conduct <i>in-situ</i> etching in the membrane module). MSR of 0.2 Å was achieved with attractive CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation performances with CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivities up to 12.6 and 27.5, respectively. The porosity in the reported membranes is only ca. 1%, and yet, attributing to the ultrashort diffusion path, extremely large gas permeances were realized, indicating that there is a large potential in further improving the gas permeance by increasing the porosity.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">A slow expansion of vacancy-defects with oxygen exposure at 200 °C could shift the molecular cutoff by 0.1 Å.
