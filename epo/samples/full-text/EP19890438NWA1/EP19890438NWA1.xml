Further, the flat plate-like cover portion 21 has a third side 21c and a fourth side 21d that are parallel to the third side 11c of the first wall 11. Thus, the flat plate-like cover portion 21 has a rectangular plate-like shape having the four sides 21a to 21d.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The first outer side surface cover portion 22 is continuous to the first side 21a serving as one side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21, via the first curved cover portion 24. The first curved cover portion 24 is curved in an arc at a central angle of 90 degrees about a central axis, which is an axis parallel to the first side 21a, from the first side 21a to the side of the first wall 11. The first outer side surface cover portion 22 has a rectangular plate-like shape parallel to the second wall 12.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Similarly, the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is continuous to the second side 21b serving as one side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21, via the second curved cover portion 25. The second curved cover portion 25 is curved in an arc at a central angle of 90 degrees about a central axis, which is an axis parallel to the second side 21b, from the second side 21b to the first wall 11. The second outer side surface cover portion 23 has a rectangular plate-like shape parallel to the third wall 13.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Each of the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is provided with two attaching holes 26 (Note: <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one attaching hole 26 of the first outer side surface cover portion 22). As illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, on the other hand, the second wall 12 and the third wall 13 of the casing body 10 are provided with two screw holes 10c on sides of the first wall 11 and sides of the fourth wall (14) and the fifth wall (15). As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10 by screwing the screw members 5 inserted into the attaching holes 26 of the cover body 20 into corresponding screw holes 10c of the casing body 10.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In a state in which the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, the flat plate-like cover portion 21 covers the opening 10b formed on the front surface of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the casing body 10. Also, in the state in which the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, the first outer side surface cover portion 22 opposes the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 with a predetermined gap therebetween and covers the outer side surface 12a. Further, in the state in which the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, the second outer side surface cover portion 23 opposes the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 with a predetermined gap therebetween and covers the outer side surface 13a.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The cover body 20 may be formed by, for example, performing sheet metal processing of a metal plate made of steel, aluminum alloy, or stainless steel. Thus, the cover body 20 having the above shape can be formed easily at low cost by a simple bending process. A plate thickness of the cover body 20 can be determined appropriately and may preferably be, for example, 0.3 mm to 3.5 mm.</p>

Accordingly, the first rib 40 and the second rib 50 provided on the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 will be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Each of the three first ribs 40 provided on the outer side surface 13a of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> third wall 13 is integrally formed with the outer side surface 13a, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Each of the first ribs 40 has a wall shape that protrudes toward the outside of the casing body 10 from the outer side surface 13a and has a protruding end opposing an inner surface of the second outer side surface cover portion 23 having a predetermined gap therefrom. Also, the first ribs 40 extend along the second side 21b serving as one side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21 between a top side of the outer side surface 13a on the side of the fourth wall 14 and a bottom side on the side of the fifth wall 15. Further, the first ribs 40 are arranged at intervals from each other in a direction orthogonal to the second side 21b and parallel to the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13. The three first ribs 40 are parallel to each other. Note that "the first ribs 40 extend along the second side 21b serving as one side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21" is not limited to a configuration in which the first ribs 40 extend strictly keeping a constant distance with respect to the second side 21b (in a configuration in which the first ribs 40 are parallel to the second side 21b) and may include a state in which the first ribs 40 are not parallel to the second side 21b.</p>

Further, of the three first ribs 40, each the first rib 40 on the side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the first rib 40 located in the middle has an approximately the same gap between their protruding direction ends and the inner surface of the second outer side surface cover portion 23. On the other hand, a gap between a protruding direction end of the first rib 40 located on the farthest side from the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the inner surface of the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is smaller than the gap between the protruding direction ends of the other two first ribs 40 and the inner surface of the second outer side surface cover portion 23.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">As described above, the power control apparatus 1 of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> embodiment can be installed outdoors in a manner being mounted on, for example, an exterior wall of a house using a mounting bracket or the like. Here, the power control apparatus installed outdoors is required to have a high waterproof property due to its environment exposed to wind and rain and, in consideration of a situation exposed to storms, desired to obtain a protection grade corresponding to "IP45" according to "JIS C0920" defined by the Japanese Industrial Standards. In this case, regarding protection against a jet flow, it is necessary to satisfy a waterproof performance that "must not have a harmful influence caused by jet water from nozzles located in all directions".</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">However, a conventional configuration in which a waterproof seal is arranged between a casing body for housing an electrical apparatus and a cover body for closing an opening of the casing body has a risk that the waterproof seal is broken and lets water enter the casing body, upon application of a large water pressure to the waterproof seal by jet water entering at a high flow rate between the casing body and the cover body.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In a configuration in which a gap is formed between the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 in a manner similar to the power control apparatus 1, because there is a risk that jet water enters the gap between the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 from a rear surface. i.e., the casing body 10 on the side of the first wall 11, a high waterproof performance is required against such jet water. Similarly, in the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, because a gap is formed also between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13, jet water may enter a gap between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 from the rear surface, i.e., the casing body 10 on the side of the first wall 11, and thus a high waterproof performance is required against such jet water.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">In the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, on the other hand, because the first ribs 40 are provided on the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 covered by the first outer side surface cover portion 22, even if jet<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> water enters a gap between the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12, the jet water can hit the first ribs 40 and reduce its force. Thus, an amount of jet water reaching the third sealing piece 30c can be reduced, and a water pressure of the jet water reaching the third sealing piece 30c is reduced, whereby the third sealing piece 30c arranged between the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the casing body 10 can reliably suppress water intrusion. Similarly, in the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, because the first ribs 40 are provided also on the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 covered by the second outer side surface cover portion 23, even if jet water enters the gap between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13, the jet water can hit the first rib 40 and reduce its force. Thus, an amount of jet water reaching the fourth sealing piece 30d is reduced, and a water pressure of the jet water reaching the fourth sealing piece 30d is reduced, whereby the fourth sealing piece 30d arranged between the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the casing body 10 can reliably suppress the water intrusion.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The first ribs 40 simply need to extend along the first side 21a and the second side 21b, which are the respective sides of the flat plate-like cover portion 21, and preferably extend in parallel with them, as described in the present embodiment. In this configuration, the first ribs 40 extend in a direction orthogonal to jet water entering toward the opening 10b from a rear side of the casing body 10 and can effectively block a flow of jet water entering the gap between the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 and the gap between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13. Thus, the third sealing piece 30c and the fourth sealing piece 30d can improve the waterproof properties between the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the casing body 10.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Further, in a manner similar to the power control apparatus 1 according to the present embodiment, the plurality of first ribs 40 arranged side by side at intervals on the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a can reduce, in a stepwise manner, the force of jet water entering the gap between the first outer side surface cover portion<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 22 and the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 and the gap between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13. As a result, the amounts of jet water reaching the third sealing piece 30c and the fourth sealing piece 30d can be further reduced, and the water pressures of the jet water reaching the third sealing piece 30c and the fourth sealing piece 30d can be further reduced, whereby the third sealing piece 30c and the fourth sealing piece 30d can reliably suppress the water intrusion between the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and the casing body 10.</p>

That is, each of the second ribs 50 extends in a direction orthogonal to each of the first ribs 40. Further, the second ribs 50 are arranged spaced apart from one another in a direction orthogonal to the second side 21b and parallel to the outer surface 13a of the third wall 13, i.e., an extension direction of the first ribs 40.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the second ribs 50 includes a pair of first protruding portions 50a protruding from the outer side surface 13a by a predetermined height and a second protruding portion 50b protruding from the outer surface 13a by a smaller protrusion height than the first protruding portions 50a. The first protruding portions 50a are provided on the front side of the second ribs 50<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> on the side of the opening 10b and the rear side of the second ribs 50 on the side of the first wall 11, and the second protrusion 50b is provided between the first protrusions 50a.

On the other hand, of the three first ribs 40, the first rib 40 arranged farthest from the opening 10b is orthogonal to the first protruding portion 50a of the second rib 50.

<p id="p0060" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, in the state in which the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, the inner side of the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> in contact with the end surface of one of the first protruding portion 50a in the protruding direction on the side of the opening 10b of each of the second ribs 50 via a portion of the second partition wall 17.

In the state in which the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, because the first protruding portions 50a of the second rib 50 protruding from the outer side surface 13a support the inner surface of the outer side surface cover portion 23 as described above, a gap is formed between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">By providing the second ribs 50 in addition to the first ribs 40 on both the second wall 12 and the third wall 13, the second wall 12 and the third wall 13 can be thinner and lighter while having increased rigidity.

<p id="p0062" num="0062">The second outer side surface cover portion 23 covering the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 is supported by the first protruding portions 50a of the plurality of second ribs 50 provided on the outer side surface 13a, in a manner such that the gap is formed between the second outer side surface cover portion 23 and the outer side surface 13a. Thus, an amount of heat conducted from the third wall 13 heated by heat generated during the operation of the electrical apparatus 3 housed in the housing space 10a to the second outer side surface cover portion 23 can be reduced. As a result, excessive rising of the temperature of the cover body 20 can be suppressed, and the safety can be improved for when a user such as a resident touches the cover body 20.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">Further, because the second outer side surface cover portion 23 abuts on the first protruding portion 50a of the plurality of second ribs 50 and is arranged in the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> vicinity of the plurality of first ribs 40, the second outer side surface cover portion 23 can be supported by the plurality of second ribs 50 and the plurality of first ribs 40 when the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is pressed by the user such as the resident. Thus, excessive deformation of the second outer side surface cover portion 23 can be suppressed, and a structural strength of the cover body 20 can be improved.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, in the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, the cover body 20 is formed in the U-shape in the cross section having the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 arranged on either side of the flat plate-like cover portion 21 and is attached to the casing body 10 by being shifted along a direction vertical to the first wall 11 from the side of the opening 10b to the side of the first wall 11. At this time, the first outer side surface cover portion 22 of the cover body 20 is shifted along the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 of the casing body 10, and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 of the cover body 20 is shifted along the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 of the casing body 10. Thus, in the configuration in which the first ribs 40 are provided on the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a, the cover body 20 needs to be easily attached to the casing body 10 without causing the front ends of the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 in the assembling direction to get caught by the first ribs 40.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">In the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, on the other hand, the second ribs 50 having the protrusion height from the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a higher than the protrusion height of the first ribs 40 from the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a are provided to the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a. Thus, at the time of the attachment of the cover body 20 to the casing body 10, the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 are guided by the second ribs 50 without touching the first ribs 40. As a result, when the cover body 20 is attached to the casing body 10, the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 cam be suppressed<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> from getting caught by the first ribs 40, and the cover body 20 can be more easily attached to the casing body 10.</p>

However, by setting the protrusion height of the second ribs 50 from the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a higher than the protrusion height of the first ribs 40 from the outer side surfaces 12a and 13a, the first outer surface cover potion 22 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 can be more reliably suppressed from getting caught by the first ribs 40.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">In the power control apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, as described above, the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 is covered by the first outer side surface cover portion 22.

However, a configuration in which the second ribs 50 abut on the first outer side surface cover portion 22 throughout their lengths has a problem that the upward movement of the air is inhibited by the second ribs 50 and the heated air stays between the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 and the first outer side surface cover portion 22, whereby a heat radiation performance of the casing body 10 is reduced. Similarly, a configuration in which the second ribs 50 abut on the second outer side surface cover portion 23 throughout their lengths has a problem that the upward movement of the air between the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 is inhibited by the second ribs 50 and the heated air stays between the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23, whereby the heat radiation performance of the casing body 10 is reduced.</p>

Thus, air heated between the outer side surface 12a and the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and air heated between the outer side surface 13a and the second outer side surface cover portion 23 can pass the second ribs 50 via the second protruding portions 50b. As a result, the heated air can be exhausted to the outside without staying between the outer side surface 12a of the second wall 12 and the first outer side surface cover portion 22 and between the outer side surface 13a of the third wall 13 and the second outer side surface cover portion 23, and heat radiation performance of the casing body 10 can be improved.</p>
