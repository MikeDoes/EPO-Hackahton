<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a front vehicle-body structure for a vehicle, vehicle body structure, and a vehicle. Particularly, the present invention relates to front vehicle-body structure for a vehicle which includes an exterior member covering the upper side of an engine room, and a front grille disposed on the front lower side of the exterior member in a vehicle front portion.</p>
<heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">A cross-sectional shape of a bumper face has been conventionally known which is contrived in order to allow air (traveling air) hitting a vehicle front portion to flow along the bumper face (see Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, in a conventional structure disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a front under grille is provided at a vehicle-width-direction center of a bumper face, and an upper portion of the front under grille includes a protrusion protruding toward the vehicle front side. The protrusion is provided with a first inclined face inclined rearward and upward and a second inclined face inclined rearward and downward, and the front-rear length of the first inclined face is provided to be longer than the front-rear length of the second inclined face. This<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> makes it easier for a vehicle front portion to be pressed downward during traveling of the vehicle, thereby attempting to improve traveling stability.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Meanwhile, it is preferable that traveling air flowing from the vehicle front side hits the bumper face and then flows from the vehicle lower side to the vehicle upper side below an exterior member such as a bonnet and a bumper face upper so that air separated at a front end lower portion of the exterior member flows along a top face of the bonnet; however, when designability of the vehicle is emphasized, the air separated at the front end lower portion of the exterior member is excessively separated above the front end of the exterior member, and traveling air after separation cannot flow along the top face of the bonnet, which leads to a problem of deterioration of the air resistance.</p>

<heading id="h0005">[Summary of Invention]</heading>
<heading id="h0006">[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]</heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, the present invention has an object to provide a front vehicle-body structure for a vehicle in which traveling air flowing from the vehicle lower side to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> vehicle upper side is, after hitting a bumper face, separated at a vehicle front end, and the traveling air after separation goes around a top face of an exterior member, so that the traveling air flows along the top face of the exterior member, thereby securing aerodynamic performance.</p>
<heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problem]</heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is defined by the independent claims. Particular embodiments are defined in the dependent. A front vehicle-body structure for a vehicle according to the present invention is a front vehicle-body structure for a vehicle which includes an exterior member covering the upper side of an engine room provided in a vehicle front portion, and a front grille disposed on the vehicle up-down-direction lower side relative to a front end portion of the exterior member, wherein a rectification member extending over substantially the full width of the exterior member in the vehicle width direction is provided on the lower side of the front end portion of the exterior member, and a front piece portion extending toward the vehicle up-down-direction lower side from the exterior member to an upper end portion of the front grille and a lower piece portion extending toward the vehicle rear side from an upper end of the front piece portion are formed in the rectification member.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The above-described exterior member can be set to a bumper face upper and a bonnet.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the configuration, after traveling air flowing from the vehicle front side hits a bumper face, a flow of traveling air directed from the vehicle lower side to the vehicle upper side below a lower end of the exterior member is separated by hitting a lower end of the front piece portion of the rectification member and goes around a top face of the exterior member, so that the traveling air can flow along the top face of the exterior member. Thus, aerodynamic performance can be secured.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention may have various preferred embodiments described below. Particularly, a lower end position of the rectification member is located on the vehicle lower side at least by a predetermined distance from a front end position of the top face of the exterior member. Further particularly, the predetermined distance is set in a range of equal to or more than 15 mm and equal to or less than 30 mm.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the configuration, the above-described predetermined distance is within the range of about 15 to about 30 mm, so that a flow of traveling air separated by hitting a separation portion of the lower end of the rectification member reliably goes around the top face of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the exterior member, and the traveling air can reliably flow along the top face of the exterior member.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Incidentally, when the predetermined distance is less than 15 mm, traveling air is excessively separated above a front end of the exterior member, and the traveling air no longer flows along the top face of the exterior member, which is thus not preferable.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Conversely, when the predetermined distance exceeds 30 mm, traveling air separated by the separation portion hits a face on the front end side of the exterior member, and the traveling air no longer flows along the top face of the exterior member, which is thus not preferable.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Further particularly, a front end of the rectification member is located on the vehicle front side relative to the front end of the exterior member.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the configuration, traveling air is separated on the front side relative to the front end of the exterior member, so that traveling air after separation easily flows along an inclination of the top face of the exterior member.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Further particularly, the front end portion of the exterior member includes a bottom face portion of the exterior member which extends toward the vehicle rear side, and the rectification member includes a holding<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> portion configured to hold the bottom face portion in the vehicle up-down direction so that the bottom face portion can be mounted at least partially on the holding portion.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the configuration, the following effect is provided.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Namely, when traveling air hits a front portion of the rectification member, a force in a direction of lowering the bottom face portion of the exterior member downward acts on the rectification member, so that the exterior member can be prevented from being released during traveling of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Further particularly, the rectification member is formed by integrating, by means of synthetic resin, an upper piece portion extending in the vehicle width direction, the lower piece portion extending in the vehicle width direction below the upper piece portion, and a rear piece portion coupling rear end portions of the upper piece portion and the lower piece portion in the up-down direction and extending in the vehicle width direction.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Further particularly, a front end of the lower piece portion of the rectification member is integrally formed with the front piece portion extending downward from the front end so as to extend in the vehicle width direction, and a separation portion that is configured to separate traveling air is formed at a lower end of the front piece portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Further particularly, a rib for reinforcement is integrally formed from a front end face of an upper piece portion of the rectification member to a bottom face thereof.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Further particularly, one or a plurality of the ribs are provided so as to be spaced apart from each other at predetermined intervals in the vehicle width direction of the upper piece portion.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Further particularly, the exterior member includes a top face portion inclined in a front-low rear-high shape and a front face portion having a curved shape and extending downward from a front end position of the top face portion.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Further particularly, a vehicle body structure includes the above front vehicle-body structure.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Further particularly, a vehicle includes an engine room, and the above front vehicle-body structure and the vehicle above body structure.</p>
<heading id="h0008">[Advantageous Effect of Invention]</heading>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the present invention, an effect is provided in which traveling air flowing from the vehicle lower side to the vehicle upper side is, after hitting the bumper face, separated at a vehicle front end, and the traveling air after separation goes around the top face of the exterior member, so that the traveling air<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> flows along the top face of the exterior member, thereby securing the aerodynamic performance.</p>

<p id="p0061" num="0061">Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5(a)</figref>, after traveling air flowing from the vehicle front side hits the bumper face 30, a flow e1 of traveling air directed from the vehicle lower side to the vehicle upper side below a lower end of the bumper face upper 20 is separated by hitting the separation portion 85. An air e2 separated by the separation portion 85 goes around the top face portion 20a of the bumper face upper 20, and an air e3 after re-contact to the top face portion 20a of the bumper face upper 20 flows to the vehicle rear side along the top face portion 20a and the top face of the bonnet outer 11 of the bonnet 10.
