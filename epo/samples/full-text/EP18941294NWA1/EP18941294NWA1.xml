<p id="p0001" num="0001">This application relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a downlink signal receiving method, a terminal, and a source base station.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">When a terminal moves from a cell (source cell) to another cell (a target cell), a handover procedure may be triggered. In a time period from handover start to handover completion, the terminal no longer receives a downlink signal from the source cell, and the terminal does not receive a downlink signal from the target cell. Consequently, downlink signal transmission is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">However, with an increase in service types, a sharp increase in service data volume, and an increase in a moving speed of a terminal, requirements on service interruption time and reliability in a handover process are increasingly strict. For example, mobile office, mobile video services, vehicle wireless control, train wireless control, and the like require zero or nearly zero service interruption.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, downlink signal transmission interruption in the handover process is a problem that urgently needs to be resolved currently.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">This application provides a downlink signal receiving method, a terminal, and a source base station, to resolve a problem of downlink signal transmission interruption in a handover process.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect, this application provides a downlink signal receiving method, applied to a process in which a terminal is handed over from a source base station to a target base station, where the method includes: The terminal receives a first message from the source base station, where the first message includes a first indication, and the first indication is used to indicate the terminal to receive downlink signals on a same frequency, in other words, indicate to receive downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station on a same carrier frequency. The terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Based on this solution, the terminal may receive the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station in a handover process. For example, when the terminal needs to receive the downlink signal from the target base station while receiving the downlink signal from the source base station in the handover process, the terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station. When receiving no downlink signal from the target base station, the terminal receives the downlink signal (where the downlink signal carries downlink data) only from the source base station. In addition, after handover is completed, the terminal receives the downlink signal (where the downlink signal carries downlink data) only from the target base station, so that the terminal can still receive the downlink signal from the source base station in the handover process. Therefore, downlink signal transmission interruption caused by the handover process may be reduced to 0 ms or nearly 0 ms. In other words, zero interruption or nearly zero interruption of data transmission may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In a possible implementation, that the terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication includes: The terminal configures at least two processing resources based on the first indication, where one processing resource includes a baseband resource and a fast Fourier transformation FFT, and at least two processing resources correspond to a same carrier frequency. The terminal receives the downlink signal from the source base station by using a first processing resource in the at least two processing resources. The terminal receives the downlink signal from the target base station by using a second processing resource in the at least two processing resources, where the first processing resource is different from the second processing resource.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In a possible implementation, if the terminal has a carrier aggregation capability, a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the first processing resource is the same as a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the second processing resource, and a size of an FFT corresponding to the first processing resource is the same as a size of an FFT corresponding to the second processing resource. Alternatively,<br/>
if the terminal does not have a carrier aggregation capability, a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the second processing resource is less than or equal to a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the first processing resource, and a size of an FFT corresponding to the second processing resource is less than or equal to a size of an FFT corresponding to the first processing resource, where the bandwidth of the baseband resource included in the second processing resource is less than or equal to a preset bandwidth threshold.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the terminal sends a first capability indication to the source base station, where the first capability indication is used to indicate that the terminal has an intra-frequency receiving capability.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">In a possible implementation, the terminal does not adjust an automatic gain control AGC gain based on the first indication.

<p id="p0016" num="0016">In a possible implementation, the first message further includes a start time point. That the terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication includes: The terminal starts to receive, at the start time point, the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In a possible implementation, the first message further includes an end time point, and the terminal stops, at the end time point, receiving the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Alternatively, the first message further includes first duration. After the first duration from the start time point, the terminal stops receiving the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">In a possible implementation, the first message is a radio resource control RRC connection reconfiguration message.</p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b></heading>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">A base station includes but is not limited to a BBU, a transmission reception point (transmitting and receiving point, TRP), a transmission point (transmitting point, TP), a mobile switching center, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">It should be noted that in this application, a "handover" scenario sometimes means that a terminal is handed over from a source cell to a target cell, or sometimes means that a terminal is handed over from a source base station to a target base station. The two cases have a same meaning, and are alternately used in this application. This is centrally described herein. In addition, in this application, the "handover" scenario sometimes means that the terminal receives information (for example, a downlink signal) from the source base station/target base station, and the terminal sends information (for example, an uplink signal) to the source base station/target base station, or sometimes means that the terminal receives information (for example, a downlink signal) from the source cell/target cell, and the terminal sends information (for example, an uplink signal) to the source cell/the target cell. The two cases have a same meaning, and are alternately used in this application. This is centrally described herein.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">That is, in this application, the source base station and the source cell have a same meaning, and the target base station and the target cell have a same meaning.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">With an increase in service types, a sharp increase in service data volume, and an increase in a moving speed of the terminal, requirements on service interruption time and reliability in a handover process are increasingly strict. For example, mobile office, mobile video services, vehicle wireless control, train wireless control, and the like require zero interruption in service transmission.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In a conventional technology, in a procedure in which the terminal is handed over from the source base station to the target base station, after receiving a handover command (handover command, HO command) from the source base station, the terminal stops sending information on an uplink (uplink, UL) to the source base station, starts to search for the target base station, and synchronizes time and frequency with the target base station. Then, the terminal initiates a random access (Random access) process to the target base station. In the random access process, the terminal first obtains an occasion at which the terminal sends a random access preamble (Preamble) to the target<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> base station, in other words, an occasion (occasion) of a physical random access channel (Physical Random Access Channel, PRACH). When the occasion arrives, the terminal sends the Preamble (which is denoted as Message 1, Msg1 for short) to the target base station. Then, the terminal monitors a physical downlink control channel (Physical Downlink Control Channel, PDCCH) scrambled by using a random access radio network temporary identifier (Random Access Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier, RA-RNTI), where the PDCCH is used to schedule a random access response (Random access response, RAR) message (which is denoted as Message2, Msg2 for short). The RAR message includes uplink timing advance (Timing Advance, TA) and an uplink resource grant (UL grant). Finally, the terminal sends a handover complete (handover complete, HO complete) message (which is denoted as Message3, Msg3 for short) to the target base station by using the UL grant and the TA. The handover command may be mobility control information (Mobility Control Information), and is included in a radio resource control (Radio Resource Control, RRC) connection reconfiguration (RRC Connection Reconfiguration) message. The handover complete message may be an RRC connection reconfiguration complete (RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete) message.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">In the foregoing process in which the terminal is handed over from the source base station to the target base station, after receiving the handover command from the source base station, the terminal needs to process the command, and then stops sending an uplink signal to the source base station and stops receiving a downlink signal from the source base station. If the terminal has detected the target cell, and has information such as time synchronization and a cell identifier (cell ID) of the target cell, the terminal does not need to perform cell search including synchronization again. If the terminal does not have the foregoing information of the target cell, or the foregoing information had by the terminal is invalid, the terminal needs to perform cell search again. The terminal also needs to complete accurate time and frequency synchronization with the target cell, that is, the fine synchronization. In addition, the terminal further needs to update related configuration information of a media access control (medium access control, MAC) layer and a higher layer, and is ready to receive a signal from the target base station. In a scenario in which a random access channel (Random Access Channel, RACH) procedure needs to be performed, the terminal initiates a RACH process. After receiving the Msg3, the terminal may start to send an uplink signal to the target base station, and receive a downlink signal from the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the foregoing processes, processing of the handover command, the cell search, fine synchronization, update of MAC layer/higher layer parameters, and the RACH process cause transmission interruption of the uplink and downlink signals. That is, data transmission interruption in a cell handover process is caused. To be specific, in a time period from handover start to handover completion, the terminal no longer sends the uplink signal to the source base station, and does not receive the downlink signal from the source base station. In addition, the terminal neither<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> sends an uplink signal to the target base station, nor receives a downlink signal from the target base station. The data transmission interruption includes uplink signal transmission interruption and downlink signal transmission interruption.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">To resolve the foregoing problem of downlink signal transmission interruption, the 3rd generation partnership project (3rd generation partnership project, 3GPP) Rel-14 proposes a handover time shortening technology (for example, a make-before-break technology or an RACH-less technology). According to the 3GPP protocol 36.133, an interruption time period caused by the technology is still up to 5 ms. In other words, this technology cannot well solve the problem of downlink signal transmission interruption. In addition, this technology does not resolve interruption caused by the fine synchronization.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In addition, the RACH-less technology in the handover time shortening technology has a limitation: The technology requires that the source cell and the target cell need to be synchronized, in other words, a subframe boundary delay difference between the source cell and the target cell is fixed and less than a specific value, for example, 3 microseconds (µs). When this technology is used, the terminal sends a signal to the source cell and the target cell by using a same TA. Such a requirement is not applicable to a typical long term evolution (Long Term Evolution, LTE) frequency division duplex (Frequency Division Duplexing, FDD) asynchronous deployment scenario, another FDD deployment scenario, or a synchronization scenario in which a delay difference is relatively large.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">It should be noted that, in this application, the uplink signal includes but is not limited to uplink data, uplink signaling, an uplink message, and an uplink feedback for a downlink signal. The downlink signal includes but is not limited to: downlink data, downlink signaling, a downlink message, and a downlink feedback for an uplink signal.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">To resolve the problem of downlink signal transmission interruption caused by the handover process in the conventional technology, as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, this application provides a downlink signal receiving method. The method includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Step 201: A source base station sends a first message to a terminal. Correspondingly, the terminal may receive the first message.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The first message includes a first indication. The first indication is used to indicate the terminal to receive downlink signals on a same frequency. To be specific, the first indication is used to indicate the terminal to receive downlink signals from the source base station and a target base station on a same carrier frequency.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">Optionally, the first message may be a radio resource control (radio resource control, RRC) connection reconfiguration (Connection Reconfiguration) message.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">Step 202: The terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> station based on the first indication.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">After receiving the first indication, the terminal may directly configure a bearer on a target base station side, and monitor downlink control information (Downlink control information, DCI), to receive the downlink signal from the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Based on this method, the terminal may receive the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station in a handover process. For example, when the terminal needs to receive the downlink signal from the target base station while receiving the downlink signal from the source base station in the handover process, the terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station. When receiving no downlink signal from the target base station, the terminal receives the downlink signal (where the downlink signal carries downlink data) only from the source base station. In addition, after handover is completed, the terminal receives the downlink signal (where the downlink signal carries downlink data) only from the target base station, so that the terminal can still receive the downlink signal from the source base station in the handover process. Therefore, downlink signal transmission interruption caused by the handover process may be reduced to 0 ms or nearly 0 ms. In other words, zero interruption or nearly zero interruption may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">In an implementation, the terminal may further send a first capability indication to the source base station, where the first capability indication is used to indicate that the terminal has an intra-frequency receiving capability. Based on the method, the source base station learns that the terminal has the intra-frequency receiving capability, so that the source base station may indicate, according to the foregoing step 201, the terminal to perform intra-frequency receiving.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In an implementation, the source base station may further send a fifth capability indication or a first permission indication to the terminal, where the indication is used to indicate that the source base station supports the terminal having the intra-frequency receiving capability in performing the intra-frequency receiving or allows the terminal having the intra-frequency receiving capability to perform the intra-frequency receiving.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">In an implementation, the first message in step 201 may further include a start time point. In this case, in step 201, the terminal starts, at the start time point, to receive the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication. For example, the start time point may indicate an L<sup>th</sup> symbol of an N<sup>th</sup> subframe of an M<sup>th</sup> system frame that uses a time point of the source base station as a reference, where M, N, and L are integers greater than or equal to 0.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">In an implementation, the first message in step 201 may further include an end time point, and the terminal stops, at the end time point, receiving the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station. Alternatively, the first message includes first duration. After the first duration from the start time point, the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> terminal stops receiving the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">In an implementation, in step 202, that the terminal receives the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station based on the first indication specifically includes: The terminal configures at least two processing resources based on the first indication, where one processing resource includes a baseband resource and a fast Fourier transformation (Fast Fourier Transformation, FFT), and the at least two processing resources correspond to a same carrier frequency. The terminal receives the downlink signal from the source base station by using a first processing resource in the at least two processing resources, and receives the downlink signal from the target base station by using a second processing resource in the at least two processing resources, where the first processing resource is different from the second processing resource. Based on the method, the at least two processing resources are configured for the terminal, where the first processing resource may be used to receive the downlink signal from the source base station, and the second processing resource may be used to receive the downlink signal from the target base station. This implements receiving of the downlink signals from the source base station and the target base station.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the following uses an example to describe a specific implementation of allocating processing resources.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a processing resource allocation method used when a terminal has a carrier aggregation (Carrier Aggregation, CA) capability. If the terminal has the carrier aggregation capability, a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the first processing resource may be the same as a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the second processing resource, and a size of an FFT corresponding to the first processing resource is the same as a size of an FFT corresponding to the second processing resource.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The terminal having the carrier aggregation capability refers to a terminal that can support carrier aggregation. In a downlink, the terminal having the carrier aggregation capability can receive signals on different carriers. Therefore, the terminal includes a plurality of processing resources, where one processing resource includes an FFT and a baseband resource.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">A plurality of processing resources may be configured for each receive antenna of the terminal. For example, if the terminal has two receive antennas (in other words, two receive antennas), configuring at least two processing resources means that one or more additional processing resources are added when one processing resource exists, that is, at least two processing resources need to be configured for each antenna. That each receive antenna is configured with two processing resources is used as an example. Referring to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, each receive antenna is currently configured with one processing resource (including a 2048-point FFT and a baseband resource), and configuring two processing resources means that another processing resource is configured, where the another processing resource<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> includes a 2048-point FFT and a baseband resource. In addition, the originally configured processing resource is used to receive a downlink signal of a source cell, and the additional processing resource is used to receive a downlink signal of a target cell. Alternatively, the originally configured processing resource is used to receive a downlink signal of a target cell, and the additional processing resource is used to receive a downlink signal of a source cell.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">It should be noted that this solution is different from typical carrier aggregation. In typical carrier aggregation, a plurality of processing resources on a terminal correspond to different carrier frequencies, and these carriers are in different bands (band). However, in this solution, the plurality of processing resources correspond to a same carrier frequency. Therefore, the plurality of processing resources share a same radio frequency chain. As shown in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the radio frequency chain includes, but is not limited to, a duplexer, a low noise amplifier (Low noise amplifier, LNA), a filter (Filter), a down converter (down conversion), and an analog-digital converter (Analog-Digital converter, ADC). The two processing resources shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> share the radio frequency chain. In addition, status update of the radio frequency chain affects receiving of the downlink signals of the source cell and the target cell by the terminal.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of a processing resource allocation method used when a terminal does not have a carrier aggregation capability. For a terminal that does not have a carrier aggregation capability, to reduce costs and complexity of the terminal, low-cost asymmetric dual FFT may be designed, in other words, an additional processing resource is added. The processing resource includes a small-point FFT and a baseband resource.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">In an implementation, when the terminal does not have the carrier aggregation capability, a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the second processing resource is less than or equal to a bandwidth of a baseband resource included in the first processing resource, and a size of an FFT corresponding to the second processing resource is less than or equal to a size of an FFT corresponding to the first processing resource, where the bandwidth of the baseband resource included in the second processing resource is less than or equal to a preset bandwidth threshold. For example, referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, each receive antenna of the terminal currently has one processing resource (in other words, the first processing resource), and then an additional processing resource (in other words, the baseband resource included in the second processing resource) of 5 MHz or 10 MHz is added for each receive antenna, where the preset bandwidth threshold is greater than or equal to 5 MHz, or greater than or equal to 10 MHz. The second processing resource supports time and frequency synchronization and power delay profile (Power Delay Profile, PDP) estimation in a target cell, and information obtained by using the second processing resource may be shared with the FFT (which may be referred to as a primary FFT) corresponding to the first processing resource, so that the primary FFT can receive a downlink signal of the target cell. In addition, the size (a 1024-point FFT or a 512-point FFT in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>) of the FFT corresponding to the second processing resource is less than the size (a 2048-point FFT in <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>)<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of the FFT corresponding to the first processing resource. When the size of the FFT corresponding to the second processing resource is less than the size of the FFT corresponding to the first processing resource, an additional filter needs to be added before the FFT corresponding to the second processing resource.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">Because the size of the FFT corresponding to the first processing resource is different from the size of the FFT (which may be referred to as a secondary FFT) corresponding to the second processing resource, when the terminal receives signals from a source cell and the target cell, a bandwidth range in which the terminal works in the target cell needs to be limited. For example, a Msg2 scheduling resource may be limited. To be specific, scheduling of the Msg2 is performed within 5 MHz or 10 MHz. In a time period in which downlink signals are sent from the source cell and the target cell, a scheduling resource for data transmission in the target cell may be limited. For example, scheduling is performed within 5 MHz or 10 MHz.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">In a possible implementation, a bandwidth of a PDCCH for scheduling a physical downlink shared channel (Physical Downlink Shared CHannel, PDSCH) that carries the Msg2 may be a system bandwidth, and a bandwidth of the PDSCH used to send the Msg2 may be the foregoing 5 MHz or 10 MHz. Optionally, if the size of the FFT corresponding to the second processing resource is less than the size of the FFT corresponding to the first processing resource, before the terminal receives, from the target cell, the PDCCH that schedules the Msg2, the terminal receives, by using the FFT corresponding to the first processing resource, the PDCCH that schedules the Msg2.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">In a possible implementation, the terminal selects a preamble from a first preamble set and sends the preamble to the target cell, where the first preamble set is used for a terminal that supports a small-point FFT.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">In a possible implementation, the target cell indicates, to the terminal by using the source cell, a bandwidth or a resource set of the PDCCH that schedules the Msg2, and the terminal receives, on the indicated bandwidth or resource set, the PDCCH that schedules the Msg2.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">It should be noted that in a new radio (new radio, NR) system, a minimum cell system bandwidth is 100 M. However, due to a limitation of a terminal capability and consideration of terminal power consumption, a concept of a bandwidth part (bandwidth part, BWP) is introduced, and a terminal can work only in a specific bandwidth. When handover is performed between NR base stations, it is difficult for the terminal to have a capability of receiving the downlink signals of the source cell and the target cell. Therefore, a problem of data transmission interruption may be resolved by using the method in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. A specific implementation is as follows. The terminal reports an asymmetric FFT capability. NR is used as an example for description, for example, a primary FFT is a 4096-point FFT, and a secondary FFT is a 1024-point FFT. When the terminal receives the downlink signals of the source cell and the target cell, a bandwidth range in which the terminal receives data in the target cell or a new<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> secondary cell may be limited.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">Optionally, when reporting the asymmetric FFT capability, the terminal may report some or all of the following information: a size of the primary FFT and a size of the secondary FFT, a bandwidth that supports receiving a signal of the secondary cell, a bandwidth for receiving a signal of the target cell during handover, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">In still another implementation, when the terminal does not have a carrier aggregation capability, an implementation similar to that shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> may also be used to additionally add at least one same processing resource (in other words, the second processing resource), where the processing resource includes an FFT and a baseband resource that are same as an FFT and a baseband resource that are included in a current processing resource (in other words, the first processing resource) of an antenna of the terminal. The second processing resource supports time and frequency synchronization and PDP estimation in the target cell, and information obtained by using the second processing resource may be shared with the FFT (which may be referred to as a primary FFT) corresponding to the first processing resource, so that the primary FFT can receive a downlink signal of the target cell.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">In addition, in mobile communications, because a quantity of ADC quantization bits is limited, a received signal needs to be amplified or attenuated to a specific amplitude that is suitable for ADC quantization. Because of a fading change of a channel, an amplitude of a signal received by the terminal through the channel changes with time. Therefore, on a receiver side, there is a function unit called automatic gain control (automatic gain control, AGC). A function of the function unit is measuring a total amplitude of the received signal, and continuously adjusting a multiple of a gain over time, so that an amplitude of a signal that reaches an ADC through a radio frequency link falls within a proper input level range of the ADC. The gain adjustment is completed at a specific time point. Usually, the time point is determined by using a boundary of a frame, a subframe, or a symbol of a source cell as a reference.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is used as an example. It is assumed that signals that arrive at the terminal from the source cell and the target cell are not synchronous, or a synchronization delay difference is relatively large, for example, greater than a length of one cyclic prefix (Cyclic Prefix, CP). When the terminal performs AGC adjustment based on the boundary of the frame, the subframe, or the symbol of the source cell, for the target cell, a signal amplitude change occurs in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, OFDM) symbol. For the OFDM symbol, amplitudes of received signals before and after the AGC adjustment are greatly different. Consequently, a decoding error may occur after FFT is performed. Especially, when the affected OFDM symbol includes a cell-specific reference signal (Cell-specific reference signal, CRS), the impact is greater.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">To resolve the foregoing problem, in this application, in a time period in which the foregoing problem may occur, the terminal may avoid adjusting an AGC gain, or reduce a frequency of adjusting an AGC gain.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">In an implementation, the first indication included in the first message in step 201 is further used to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> indicate not to adjust the AGC gain. In this case, the terminal may not adjust the AGC gain based on the first indication. Alternatively, the first message in step 201 further includes a second indication, and the second indication is used to indicate not to adjust the AGC gain. In this case, the terminal may not adjust the AGC gain based on the second indication. Optionally, the terminal may further send a second capability indication to the source base station, where the second capability indication is used to indicate that the terminal has a capability of not adjusting the AGC gain.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">It should be noted that, if the first message includes a start time point, the terminal may not adjust the AGC gain from the start time point. If the first message includes an end time point or first duration, the terminal may stop, after the end time point or the first duration from the start time point, not adjusting the AGC gain, that is, may start to adjust the AGC gain in an original manner.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">In still another implementation, the first indication is further used to indicate a fading margin (Fading Margin), and the terminal sets a fixed AGC gain based on the fading margin. Alternatively, the first message further includes a third indication, the third indication is used to indicate a fading margin, and the terminal sets a fixed AGC gain based on the fading margin. Optionally, the terminal may further send a third capability indication to the source base station, where the third capability indication is used to indicate that the terminal has a capability of setting the fixed AGC gain based on the fading margin.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">It should be noted that, if the first message includes a start time point, the terminal may set the fixed AGC gain based on the fading margin from the start time point. If the first message includes an end time point or first duration, the terminal may stop, after the end time point or the first duration from the start time point, setting the fixed AGC gain based on the fading margin, that is, may start to adjust the AGC gain in an original manner.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">In an implementation, before step 201, the terminal may further send a fourth capability indication to the source base station, where the fourth capability indication is used to indicate that the terminal has a capability of sending a preamble to the target base station after second duration after the terminal device receives a handover command (where the handover command is carried in the first message). Alternatively, the fourth capability indication is used to indicate a value of the second duration, and the second duration is a time period in which the terminal processes the handover command. Further, the source base station may send the fourth capability indication to the target base station, so that the target base station can know when to start to send the downlink signal to the terminal.</p>
