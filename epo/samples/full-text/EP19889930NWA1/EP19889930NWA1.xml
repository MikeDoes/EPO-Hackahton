<p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method of manufacturing a torsion beam includes preparing a blank obtained by processing a plate material; forming an indented groove portion of the torsion beam by pressing the blank with a lower mold; rolling up the blank in such a manner that edge portions of the blank in a width direction oppose each other; a flattening operation of flattening the edge portions of the blank to be plastically deformed, by pressing the edge portions of the blank in the width direction with a protruding portion of an upper mold, in a state in which the edge portions of the blank in the width direction are supported to oppose each other by side cams; welding and joining the edge portions of the blank in the width direction, flattened in the flattening operation;<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and a quenching operation of heating an entirety of the welded and joined blank at a temperature ranging from 900 to 970°C for a retaining time within a range of 1 to 20 minutes and cooling the blank in a treatment liquid including at least one of oil and water in a range of 20 to 90°C.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">After the quenching operation, the method may include a tempering operation of heating the entirety of the blank subjected to the quenching operation to 150 to 600 degrees °C for a holding time in a range of 10 to 120 minutes, and cooling the blank in air.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Prior to the flattening operation, the method may include forming a protruding line in a direction opposite to an inward direction of the indented groove portion by pressing the blank with an upper mold having a protruding portion formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The flattening operation may be performed by horizontally processing a matching surface of the blank, in a state in which the edge portions of the blank in the width direction oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The flattening operation may be performed by flattening, such that a matching surface of the blank has an inclination angle ranging from -3.5 degrees to +3.5 degrees in a horizontal state, in a state in which the edge portions of the blank in the width direction oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">The flattening operation may be performed to plastically deform the blank in a state in which the protruding portion of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the upper mold is located in a position corresponding to a protruding line of the blank.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">A size of the protruding portion formed on the upper mold may be equal to or relatively smaller than a size of a protruding line of the blank.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The rolling up the blank may include a U-shape processing operation of fixing the blank with the upper mold and a pad, pushing the blank into the lower mold and rolling up the blank in such a manner that the blank has a 'UH' -shaped cross-section; and an O-shape processing operation of rolling up the blank up to a weldable position such that the edge portions of the blank in the width direction oppose each other and thus, the blank has an 'O'-shaped cross-section.</p>

<p id="p0019" num="0019">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, embodiments of the present disclosure may be modified in various other forms, and the scope of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described below. In addition, embodiments of the present disclosure are provided to more completely describe the present disclosure to those with average knowledge in the art. In the drawings, the shapes and sizes of elements may be exaggerated for clearer explanation.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing a torsion beam according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">FIGS. 1 to 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">A method of manufacturing a torsion beam according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may include a blank preparation operation ((S1)), an indented groove forming operation (S2), a rolling-up operation (S3), a flattening operation (S4), a welding joining operation (S5), and a quenching operation (S7), and may additionally include a protruding line forming operation (S6) and a tempering operation S8.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">FIGS. 1 to 9B</figref>, the method of manufacturing a torsion beam may include the blank preparation operation (S1) of preparing a blank S obtained by processing a plate material, the indented groove forming operation (S2) of pressing the blank S with a lower mold 30 to form an indented groove portion 200 of a torsion beam 10, a rolling-up operation (S3) of rolling up so that both edges of the blank S oppose each other in a width direction D2, a flattening operation (S4) in which a protruding portion 21 of an upper mold 20 presses both edges of the blank<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> S in the width direction D2 to be plastically deformed to be flat, in a state in which both edges of the blank S in the width direction D2 are supported to oppose each other by side cams 40, the welding joining operation (S5) of welding and joining the flattened both edges of the blank S in the width direction D2, and a quenching operation (S7) of heating the welded and joined whole blank S at a temperature ranging from 900 to 970 degrees (°C), forming a holding time in the range of 1 to 20 minutes, and cooling the blank S in a treatment liquid containing at least one of oil and water in the range of 20 to 90 degrees (°C).</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the method of manufacturing a torsion beam according to an exemplary embodiment includes the quenching operation (S7) after the welding and joining operation, to heat treat the entire blank S, thereby preventing a softening phenomenon that may occur in a welded portion after welding in high-strength steel or the like. In addition, since the strength of the welded portion may have the same characteristics as the strength of a base metal portion other than the welded portion, there is an effect of improving the durability of the welded portion.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In this manner, the reason why the entire welded blank S is heated in the range of 900 to 970 degrees °C is that there is a problem, in which if the heating temperature is lower than 900 degrees in the quenching operation (S7), austenite is not generated, and if the heating temperature is higher than 970<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> degrees, the austenite crystal becomes coarse to reduce the final strength.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">For example, the treatment liquid used in the quenching operation (S7) may be composed of 15 to 25% of oil by weight, and the rest: water and unavoidably-included impurities.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the method of manufacturing a torsion beam may include, after the quenching operation (S7), a tempering operation (S8) of heating the entire blank S having been subjected to the quenching operation (S7) to 150 to 600 degrees (°C) to form a holding time in the range of 10 to 120 minutes, and cooling the blank S in air.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In the tempering operation S8, to remove residual stress and induce recrystallization in the blank S that has undergone through the quenching operation (S7), a relatively long temperature holding time should be formed at a relatively low temperature, compared to the quenching operation (S7).</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">In this manner, the reason for heating the entire blank S to which the quenching operation (S7) was applied, at a temperature ranging from 150 to 600 degrees °C, in the tempering operation (S8), is that if a heating temperature in the quenching operation (S7) is lower than 150 degrees °C, the effect of tempering decreases, and if the heating temperature is higher than 600 degrees °C, the martensite fraction may be too low, resulting in a problem in which the strength may decrease.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In addition, the reason for maintaining the holding time in the range of 10 to 120 minutes for the entire blank to which the quenching operation (S7) was applied, in the tempering operation S8, is that if the holding time in the tempering operation (S8) is less than 10 minutes, there is no effect of tempering and thus brittleness may be maintained high, and if the holding time in the tempering operation (S8) exceeds 120 minutes, the effect of the quenching operation (S7) may be lost.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In more detail, the blank S, which has undergone the quenching operation (S7), is heated to 200 to 550 degrees °C to form a holding time in the range of 10 to 120 minutes, and may be cooled in air.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">For example, in the case of the blank S that has undergone up to the welding joining operation (S5), before the quenching operation (S7) and the tempering operation S8, the yield strength is 992 to 444 unit: MPa, and the tensile strength is 620 to 696 Unit: MPa, and the elongation unit: % is 22 to 25%.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">As described above, the case of prior to the quenching operation (S7) and the tempering operation S8 is a state in which elongation is sufficiently secured, but the yield strength and tensile strength are significantly low, and thus, the method of manufacturing a torsion beam according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may include the quenching operation (S7) and the tempering operation S8.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In the quenching operation (S7), the entire blank S was heated at 900 degrees °C for 7 minutes, and 80% of water and 20% of oil in weight percent were applied as a treatment liquid in performing the quenching operation (S7), and as a result, the yield strength was 1186 MPa, the tensile strength was 1951 MPa, and the elongation was 6.6%.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In this case, the tensile strength was very high, but the ductility was insufficient, and thus, by heating at 200 degrees for 30 minutes in the next operation, the tempering operation, the yield strength was 1466 MPa, the tensile strength was 1830 MPa, and the elongation of 10.4% could be obtained.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">As described above, it can be seen that the method of manufacturing a torsion beam according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure further includes the quenching operation (S7) and the tempering operation S8, thereby generating a martensite structure to significantly improve yield strength and tensile strength, while securing sufficient elongation, and thus suppressing brittleness.

<p id="p0038" num="0038">As an example, the blank S having a set shape may be prepared by cutting a plate material formed of a metal plate such as steel or the like.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">As an example, the blank S may be comprised of a steel plate having a tensile strength of 780 MPa or more.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In more detail, the blank S may be formed of a steel plate having a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0003">4</figref>, in the indented groove forming operation (S2), the indented groove portion 200 of the torsion beam 10 may be formed by pressing the blank S with the lower<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> mold 30.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In the indented groove forming operation (S2), the indented groove portion 200 of the torsion beam 10 may be formed by pressing the blank S with the lower mold 30 to deform the lower surface of the blank S upwardly.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the inflow of the blank S may be controlled with the upper mold 20 and a holder 70, and the indented groove portion 200 may be formed in the torsion beam 10 by pressing the blank S with the lower mold 30 in a state in which the blank S is disposed between the upper mold 20 and the lower mold 30.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In this case, a plurality of guides 60 may be disposed to penetrate through the upper mold 20 and the holder 70.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref>, <figref idref="f0004">5 and 6</figref>, in the rolling-up operation (S3), edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 may be rolled up to oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In the rolling-up operation (S3), the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 may be rolled up in the protruding direction of a protruding line 300.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the rolling-up operation (S3), the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 of the blank S may be rolled up by the lower mold 30 or the side cam 40, to be opposed to each other.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the rolling-up operation (S3) may include a U-shaped processing operation (S3)-1 of fixing the components with the upper mold 20 and a pad 80, pushing the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> blank S into the lower mold 30, and rolling up the blank S to have a 'U'-shaped cross-section, and an O-shaped processing operation (S3)-2 of rolling up so that both edges of the blank S in the width direction D2 are rolled-up to a weldable position to be opposed to each other, to have an 'O'-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">The torsion beam 10 may be processed to have an 'O'-shaped cross-sectional shape by the side cams 40 disposed on both side surfaces thereof.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">When processing into an 'O<i>'</i>-shaped cross-sectional shape by the side cams 40, the torsion beam 10 should not be in contact with the protruding portion 21 of the upper mold 20.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">This is to prevent the protrusion portion 21 of the upper mold 20 from being caught in a welded joint W of the blank S and thus causing unwanted deformation, when processed into an 'O'-shaped cross-sectional shape by the side cams 40.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">For example, in the state in which the protruding portion 21 of the upper mold 20 is disposed between both edges of the blank S in the width direction D2, when the blank S is processed to have an 'O'-shaped cross-sectional shape by the side cams 40, deformation may occur in which the gap between both edges of the blank S in the width direction D2 is excessively widened by the protruding portion 21 of the upper mold 20.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Thereafter, when the torsion beam 10 is processed into an 'O<i>'</i>-shaped cross-sectional shape by the side cams 40 disposed<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> on both sides, fine adjustments may be performed to fit the final shape of the torsion beam 10, while adjusting the upper mold 20, the lower mold 30, and the side cam 40.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>, in the rolling-up operation (S3), edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 of the blank S may be rolled up in the inward direction of the protruding line 300 in a state in which fixed molds 50 are disposed in both end regions of the blank S in a length direction D1.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">By disposing the fixed molds 50 in the both end regions of the blank S in the length direction D1, end portions of a beam body 100 may be produced to have a shape for coupling trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in the flattening operation (S4), in a state in which the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 are supported by the side cams 40 to be opposed to each other, the protruding portion 21 of the upper mold 20 presses the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 to be plastically deformed flat.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="f0009">9A</figref>, in the flattening operation (S4), the matching surface of the blank S may be horizontally processed in the state in which both edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">For example, the upper surface and the lower surface may be processed horizontally while both edge regions of the blank S in the width direction D2 are opposed to each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">For example, in the flattening operation (S4), in a state in which edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 are opposed, the matching surface of the blank S may be flattening processed to be in the range of an inclination angle of -3.5 degrees to +3.5 degrees in a horizontal state.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">As an example, in a state in which both edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 contacting each other, the opposed matching surfaces of the blank S may be flatly processed.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">At least in a state in which edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 are adjacent, the upper mold 20 may press adjacent edge portions of the blank S to form the matching surfaces in parallel.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">In this case, the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2, which have been disposed adjacently by the pressure of the upper mold 20, may be in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As another example, in the flattening operation (S4), the opposed matching surfaces of the blank S may be processed to be flat in a state in which the edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 contacting each other.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">In the flattening operation (S4), in a state in which edge portions of the blank S in the width direction D2 are in contact, the upper mold 20 may press the edge portions of the blank S in contact with each other to form the matching surfaces in<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> parallel.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="f0009">9A</figref>, in the flattening operation (S4), plastic deformation may be formed in a state in which the protruding portion 21 of the upper mold 20 is disposed in a position corresponding to the protruding line 300 of the blank S.</p>

<p id="p0068" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="f0009">9A</figref>, in the method of manufacturing the torsion beam 10 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the protrusion portion 21 of the upper mold 20 presses the matching surfaces of the blank S to induce plastic deformation thereof, thereby reducing the force that the blank (S) undergone the rolling-up operation (S3) is to be elastically restored.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">Accordingly, while a flat surface T1 is formed to enable the matching surface to be flat, the shape precision of the welded joint W is secured to secure the integrity of the welded joint W to improve the durability of the welded joint W.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p>
