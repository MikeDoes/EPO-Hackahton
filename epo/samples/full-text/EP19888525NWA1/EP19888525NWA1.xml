<heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a minoxidil sulfotransferase activity enhancer and a composition for scalp and hair, each comprising a jellyfish collagen as an active ingredient.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, hair trouble such as thinning hair or fallen hair has been increased due to various factors such as aging, stress and ultraviolet rays. The hair is an extremely important element for beauty, and thus, thinning hair or fallen hair exhibits negative effects on psychological aspects. Moreover, although thinning hair and fallen hair have been considered to be male worries, such thinning hair and fallen hair have also become serious problems for women due to a reduction in female hormone and the like. The development of hair care agents and the market therefor are increasing steadily.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventionally, a cause of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has been considered to be the overaction of male hormones. In particular, it has been known that the main body of male hormone activity in organs such as hair roots or sebaceous glands is 5α-dihydrotestosterone generated as a result of the reduction of testosterone by testosterone-5α-reductase. As such, there have been proposed many hair restorers comprising a natural substance, etc. having an action to inhibit testosterone-5α-reductase (Patent Literatures 1 and 2, etc.).</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Meanwhile, minoxidil (chemical name: 2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxide) has been developed as a hypotensive agent based on its vasodilator action. However, it was found that minoxidil causes a hirsutism phenomenon as a side effect. From such findings, minoxidil has started to be used as a drug that exhibits an excellent hair growth/hair restoration effect when it is externally applied. External agents comprising minoxidil have been commercially available both in Japan and abroad. Differing from the above-described testosterone-5α-reductase inhibitory action, minoxidil directly acts on hair follicles that envelop hair roots in the dermis and generates various growth factors, and thus, minoxidil has excellent hair growth phase-extending action and excellent hair growth phase-inducing action (Non Patent Literature 1, etc.).</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, for the purpose of the reinforcement of the hair growth/hair restoration effect of minoxidil, alleviation of the skin irritancy side effects, stability in a solution, etc., hair restorers comprising other components in combination with the minoxidil have also been developed. For example, a hair restorer composition characterized by comprising minoxidil and crude drugs, namely, a Jatoba extract and/or a Betula extract (Patent Literature 3), a hair restorer comprising minoxidil and a plant extract from soybeans, pueraria roots or the like (Patent Literature 4), a hair restorer composition characterized by comprising minoxidil and carpronium chloride (Patent Literature 5), and the like have been reported. Thus, minoxidil has excellent hair growth/hair restoration effects, and there has been a high demand for hair care products comprising such minoxidil. On the other hand, it has also been reported that, since minoxidil exhibits its medicinal effects by being activated with sulfotransferase in a living body, the effects of the minoxidil are low when the sulfotransferase activity is low in the scalp (Non Patent Literature 2).</p>

<heading id="h0006">Summary of Invention</heading>
<heading id="h0007">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to discover a substance having the effect of enhancing the activity of minoxidil sulfotransferase in the scalp, and then, to use this substance together with minoxidil to provide a drug, in which the hair growth/hair restoration effect of the minoxidil is enhanced.</p>
<heading id="h0008">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">As a result of intensive studies directed towards achieving the aforementioned object, the present inventors have found that a jellyfish collagen can enhance the activity of minoxidil sulfotransferase to convert minoxidil to minoxidil sulfate. In addition, a gene expression analysis was performed on human epidermal keratinocytes, to which jellyfish collagen had been added. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> result, a significant fluctuation (increase or decrease) was confirmed in terms of the expression level of a group of genes associated with the formation of hair, such as hair growth, cell proliferation, hair cycle, and hair follicle formation. Thus, it was found that the hair growth/hair restoration effect of minoxidil can be further improved, if a jellyfish collagen is used in combination with the minoxidil. The present invention has been completed based on such findings.</p>

<heading id="h0009">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Since a jellyfish collagen is capable of reinforcing the activity of minoxidil sulfotransferase in the scalp, it can enhance the hair growth/hair restoration effect of minoxidil by being used in combination with the minoxidil. Therefore, the composition for scalp and hair of the present invention comprising a jellyfish collagen is effective for the prevention and/or improvement of thinning hair or fallen hair.</p>
<heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<heading id="h0011">1. Minoxidil sulfotransferase activity enhancer</heading>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The minoxidil sulfotransferase activity enhancer of the present invention comprises a jellyfish-derived collagen (hereinafter referred to as a "jellyfish collagen") as an active ingredient. Herein, the minoxidil sulfotransferase includes SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1A, phenol-preferring, member 1), SULT1A2 (sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1A, phenol-preferring, member 2), and SULT1A3 (sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1A, phenol-preferring, member 3).</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The jellyfish collagen used in the present invention is typically a water-soluble undenatured collagen derived from a jellyfish. However, as long as the present jellyfish collagen has the above-described effects, it includes a denatured collagen subjected to a heat denaturation treatment and a low-molecular-weight collagen peptide prepared by decomposing these collagens by an enzyme treatment or an acidic treatment. In addition, a jellyfish extract comprising a jellyfish collagen may be directly used as a jellyfish collagen in the present invention, but<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> such a jellyfish extract is preferably isolated and/or purified by concentration, liquid-liquid distribution, or various types of chromatography.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present invention, the term "jellyfish" is used to mean jellyfish belonging to Cnidaria, and examples of the jellyfish may include moon jellyfish, red jellyfish, <i>Owan</i> jellyfish, <i>Nomura's</i> jellyfish, <i>Andon</i> jellyfish, <i>Bizen</i> jellyfish, and <i>Habu</i> jellyfish. The jellyfish collagen used in the present invention is not particularly limited, as long as it is a collagen prepared from a jellyfish. The present jellyfish collagen is preferably derived from moon jellyfish, <i>Nomura's</i> jellyfish and <i>Bizen</i> jellyfish, since the safety of these types of jellyfishes to humans and other animals has been confirmed.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The jellyfish collagen used in the present invention can be prepared by a method comprising treating a jellyfish with a buffer or an aqueous solution having a salt concentration similar to marine water, and then extracting a jellyfish collagen from the treated solution. The site of the jellyfish used in the extraction is not particularly limited, and examples of the site of the jellyfish that can be used in the extraction may include epidermis, oral arms, corpus ventriculi, a body fluid, and a liquid component generated as a result of cryopreservation or preservation at normal temperature. The extraction can be carried out, for example, by treating a jellyfish with a phosphate buffer or a solution containing approximately 0.2% sodium chloride, and then leaving the treated solution at a low temperature of approximately 4°C overnight. The extracted jellyfish collagen is subjected to a treatment such as freeze-drying or spray drying, so that water can be removed from the extracted jellyfish collagen. Otherwise, an aqueous solution comprising a jellyfish collagen is subjected to salting-out using inorganic salts such as ammonium sulfate, or to a precipitation method using alcohol such as ethanol, so as to precipitate the jellyfish collagen, and a method such as centrifugation or filtration is then applied, so that the jellyfish collagen can be separated. A method<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of obtaining an extract comprising a jellyfish collagen using the aforementioned jellyfish sites as materials, and a method of purifying the obtained extract according to a method commonly used in purification of proteins, such as ethanol precipitation or liquid chromatography, may be carried out in accordance with the descriptions of <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP5775221B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 5775221</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO2014030323A"><text>WO2014/030323</text></patcit>) and Patent Publication (Kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO201327381A"><text>2013-27381 A</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">For example, the method described in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP5775221B"><text>Japanese Patent No. 5775221</text></patcit> is a fractional extraction method of jellyfish mucin and collagen, and this method comprises: (i) a protein separation step of mixing a liquid component obtained by solid-liquid separation of a hydrous crushed product obtained by crushing a jellyfish with water-soluble alcohol containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms (preferably, ethyl alcohol and propyl alcohol) so that the concentration of the water-soluble alcohol containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms becomes at least 50% by volume with respect to the entire mixture, and then subjecting the obtained mixture to solid-liquid separation to obtain a solid; and (ii) a step of mixing the solid obtained in the above-described protein separation step with an aqueous solution of water-soluble alcohol containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms (preferably, ethyl alcohol and propyl alcohol) having an alcohol concentration of 10% to 40% by mass, and then performing a solid-liquid separation operation on the obtained mixture, so that a mucin-containing liquid component and a collagen-containing solid can be obtained, separately. Subsequently, the obtained collagen-containing solid is subjected to a known purification operation such as, for example, ion exchange chromatography, and then, to a drying operation such as, for example, freeze-drying, so that the collagen can be isolated. The jellyfish collagen can be identified by quantifying the content of glycine (Gly) according to an amino acid analysis.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The jellyfish collagen prepared by the above-described method has a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> structure similar to the V-shaped collagen of mammals that is formed with the heterotrimer 1α2α3. When compared with collagens derived from other species, the jellyfish collagen is characterized in that it contains a large amount of sugar and also contains a large amount of hydroxylysine compared with hydroxyproline, and also in that it has an amino acid composition in which glycine (Gly) accounts for approximately one third of the total amino acid amount.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, the jellyfish collagen used in the present invention is commercially available, and JelliCollagen (registered trademark) can be preferably used.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The jellyfish collagen prepared by the above-described method, etc. can be processed into any shapes such as powders, granules, and pellets, or it can be dissolved in a suitable solvent to prepare a solution. The solvent used to dissolve the jellyfish collagen is not particularly limited, and examples of the solvent that can be used herein may include: solvents generally used in a neutral range, such as water, a normal saline, or a phosphate buffer; and acidic solvents such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. When the jellyfish collagen is processed into powders, it is preferably preserved at -20°C to 10°C, and is further preferably preserved together with a desiccant such as silica gel. On the other hand, when the jellyfish collagen is processed into a solution, it is preferably preserved at 10°C or lower.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Upon the use of the jellyfish collagen in the agent of the present invention, it is preferable that the above-described jellyfish collagen and a jellyfish extract comprising the same have previously been subjected to a treatment of removing or reducing pathogenic components including endotoxin, antigenic components, and allergenic components from the jellyfish collagen and the jellyfish extract.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> The jellyfish collagen has an action to reinforce minoxidil sulfotransferase activity. Minoxidil is a drug that exhibits hair growth effects via an ATP-sensitive potassium channel in a dermal papilla cell, and the medicinal effects of minoxidil are exhibited, when the minoxidil is converted to minoxidil sulfate by the action of sulfotransferase (minoxidil sulfotransferase) on the minoxidil in a living body. Accordingly, the jellyfish collagen reinforces the activity of minoxidil sulfotransferase in the scalp, so that it can enhance the hair growth effects of minoxidil.</p>
<heading id="h0012">2. Agent for regulating expression of hair growth/hair restoration-related factors</heading>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The above-described jellyfish collagen has an action to change (accelerate or reduce) the expression of hair growth/hair restoration-related factors in the scalp. Hence, the jellyfish collagen can also be used as an agent for regulating (promoting or suppressing) the expression of hair growth/hair restoration-related factors. In the present invention, the phrase "promotion or suppression of the expression of hair growth/hair restoration-related factors" is used to mean that the transcription of genes encoding hair growth/hair restoration-related factors into mRNA is promoted or suppressed, or the translation of the mRNA is promoted or suppressed, so that the expression levels of the hair growth/hair restoration-related factors can be significantly increased or decreased, compared with scalp onto which the jellyfish collagen is not applied. For example, the expression levels of hair growth/hair restoration-related factors in scalp, onto which the jellyfish collagen is applied, are desirably increased or decreased by 1.1 times or more, preferably 2 times or more, more preferably 3 times or more, and further preferably 5 times or more, compared with the expression levels thereof in scalp, onto which the jellyfish collagen is not applied.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The factors whose expression is accelerated by the jellyfish collagen include BMP2, BMPR1A, GSK3B, BCL2, VEGFB, VEGFC, FGF7, NOG, SMAD4, TGFB1,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> GAS1, THBS2, BMP7, EFNA1, IRF6, and SOX9.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">BMP2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2) is one type of bone morphogenetic protein. It has been known that if the function of BMP2 is inhibited in the skin, the growth of hair matrix cells in hair roots is abnormally increased and differentiation of hair is damaged. In addition, it has also been confirmed that the expression of BMP2 is particularly significantly reduced, among growth factor genes whose expression is reduced in male subjects with fallen hair (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Recent Progression in Elucidation of Hair Growth Regulation Mechanism and Hair Restorers, Journal of Society Cosmetic Chemists Japan, 1999; 33: 220-228</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Regarding BMPR1A (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor, type 1A), it has been demonstrated that a reduction in the expression level of a BMPR1A gene or a reduction in intracellular signals downstream thereof is likely to be one factor for the onset of fallen hair (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>BMPR1A signaling is necessary for hair follicle cycling and hair shaft differentiation in mice, Development 2004; 131: 1825-1833</text></nplcit>).</p>

<p id="p0036" num="0036">On the other hand, the gene whose expression is decreased by the jellyfish collagen may be, for example, ILIA. ILIA (Interleukin-1 alpha) is an inflammatory factor, and ILIA has been known to have an action to suppress the growth of hair and an action to induce apoptosis (cell death) to hair. IL1A is considered to be a factor causing fallen hair, and it has been reported that ILIA is associated with the thinning hair of females (<nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="s"><text>Association analysis of IL1A and IL1B variants in alopecia areata, Heredity (Edinb). 2001; 87: 215-219</text></nplcit>).
