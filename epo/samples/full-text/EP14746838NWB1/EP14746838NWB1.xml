The electric command is output to the pressure control valve. The pressure control valve sets the open amount (open degree) of the pressure control valve based on the electric command. The pressure control valve, which is connected to the air tank, supplies the brake cylinder with air, the amount of which corresponds to the open degree. The brake cylinder is operated by the supplied air. This applies braking force, which corresponds to a value set by the brake control unit, to the wheels of the railroad vehicle.</p>

<p id="p0011" num="0011">There is always a possibility of a failure occurring in a railroad vehicle during commercial operation. Thus, the railroad vehicle may be deadheaded from the location where the failure occurred to a maintenance depot by another railroad vehicle (hereafter referred to as the rescuing vehicle). The rescued railroad vehicle (hereafter referred to as the rescued vehicle) is coupled to the rescuing vehicle and transported to the maintenance depot.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">For example, the brake device of the rescuing vehicle may be an electric commanding air brake device, and the brake device of the rescued vehicle may be an automatic air brake device. In such a case, the rescuing vehicle does not include a brake pipe. Thus, the rescuing vehicle cannot use the brake pipe of the rescued vehicle to apply the brakes on the rescued vehicle. In a vehicle formation formed by coupling a rescuing vehicle and a rescued vehicle, the brakes are needed to be applied on the rescuing vehicle and the rescued vehicle by only the brake device of the rescuing vehicle. In this vehicle formation, it is difficult to quickly stop the vehicles with the brakes. Thus, the rescuing vehicle and the rescued vehicle cannot travel at a high speed, and the deadheading of the rescued vehicle takes time.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention described in patent document 1, which is configured under the assumption that the rescuing vehicle and the rescued vehicle both include brake pipes, does not take into consideration connection to a railroad vehicle that does not include a brake pipe.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a railroad vehicle brake device that does not use a brake pipe to apply brakes on a railroad vehicle including the railroad vehicle brake device but nevertheless is able to use another railroad vehicle brake device that includes a brake pipe.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015"><b>According to the present invention said object is solved by a railroad vehicle brake device arranged in a railroad vehicle having the features of independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments are laid down in the dependent claims.</b>
<ol id="ol0001" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(1) To achieve the above object, a railroad vehicle brake device according to one aspect of the present invention is a railroad vehicle brake device arranged in a railroad vehicle and includes a first brake controller and a second brake controller. The first brake controller includes a first valve device connected to a main reservoir pipe. The first valve device includes a first gate of which open amount corresponds to a first electric command serving as a predetermined electric signal, and the first valve device outputs fluid pressure, which serves as drive pressure from the main reservoir pipe, from the first gate to a brake actuator. The second brake controller sets a brake pipe pressure of an automatic air brake device included in a counterpart railroad vehicle serving as a railroad vehicle that is separate from the railroad vehicle. The second brake controller includes a second valve device. The second valve device is configured to be capable of setting the brake pipe pressure by supplying air to or exhausting air from the fluid pressure from the main reservoir pipe when operated based on a second electric command serving as predetermined electric signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
<br/>
With this configuration, in a railroad vehicle including the railroad vehicle brake device (hereafter, referred to also as the primary vehicle), the railroad vehicle brake device is able to realize an electric commanding brake. Further, the railroad vehicle brake device is able to use an automatic air brake device including a brake pipe and installed in a counterpart railroad vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> More specifically, the railroad vehicle brake device can drive the brake actuator of the primary vehicle to generate braking force corresponding to the command value of the first electric command. Further, the railroad vehicle brake device can set the brake pipe of the counterpart railroad vehicle to a brake pipe pressure based on the second electric command. In this manner, the present invention allows for the use of the brake device of the counterpart railroad vehicle that includes the brake pipe even with a structure that does not use a brake pipe to apply brakes to the railroad vehicle provided with the railroad vehicle brake device. This allows the primary vehicle and the counterpart railroad vehicle to be further promptly slowed down.
</li>
<li>(2) Preferably, the first valve device includes a first electro-pneumatic conversion valve and a first relay valve. The first electro-pneumatic conversion valve is connected to the main reservoir pipe. The first electro-pneumatic conversion valve converts the fluid pressure to a first control pressure and outputs the first control pressure when operated based on the first electric command. The first relay valve includes the first gate and sets the open amount of the first gate in correspondence with the first control pressure.
<br/>
With this configuration, in correspondence with the first control pressure, which is a pilot pressure, the first relay valve is able to output fluid having the necessary volume to the brake actuator as drive force corresponding to the first electric command. Thus, the structure of the first electro-pneumatic conversion valve formed by an electromagnetic valve or the like is compact.
</li>
<li>(3) Preferably, the second valve device is configured to be capable of setting the brake pipe pressure having a value associated with a value of the drive pressure.
<br/>
With this configuration, the drive pressure that supplies the fluid of the brake pipe to the brake actuator of the primary vehicle is associated with the brake pipe pressure. As a result, the railroad vehicle brake device ensures further conformance of the braking state of the primary vehicle and the braking state of the counterpart railroad vehicle. Consequently, the railroad vehicle brake device of the primary vehicle cooperates with the automatic air brake device of the counterpart railroad vehicle to further promptly slow down the primary vehicle and the counterpart railroad vehicle.
</li>
<li>(4) Preferably, the first valve device is configured to supply the drive pressure to the brake actuator after a predetermined time elapses from when the brake pipe pressure from the second brake controller is reduced.
<br/>
With this configuration, the first valve device outputs the drive pressure when receiving the first electric command, which is an electric signal, and operates the brake actuator. Thus, the first valve device outputs the drive pressure within a short time from when receiving the first electric command and has high responsiveness. In the counterpart railroad vehicle, the brake actuator of the counterpart railroad vehicle is operated when the pressure of the brake pipe changes. Thus, in the brake device of the counterpart railroad vehicle, the speed at which a pressure change propagates in the brake pipe is lower than the propagation speed of an electric signal, and the responsiveness is relatively low. Taking these characteristics into consideration, the point of time for starting the supply of drive pressure from the first valve device is delayed from the point of time for reducing the pressure of the brake pipe pressure from the second valve device. This further increases the conformance of the operation timing of the brake actuator of the primary vehicle and the operation timing of the brake actuator of the counterpart railroad vehicle. As a result, the counterpart railroad<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> vehicle does not excessively push the primary vehicle when applying the brakes. Thus, the coupler is not adversely affected.
</li>
<li>(5) Preferably, the second brake controller includes a main brake pipe connected to the main reservoir pipe and to the brake pipe of the counterpart railroad vehicle, and the second valve device includes a second electro-pneumatic conversion valve and a second relay valve. The second electro-pneumatic conversion valve is connected to the main brake pipe. The second electro-pneumatic conversion valve converts the fluid pressure to a second control pressure and outputs the second control pressure when operated based on the second electric command. The second relay valve includes a second gate that adjusts the fluid pressure to the brake pipe pressure and outputs the fluid pressure. The second relay valve sets an open amount of the second gate in correspondence with the second control pressure.
<br/>
With this configuration, the brake pipe pressure and the necessary air amount can be generated in correspondence with the second electric command serving as an electric signal. This allows for the braking amount of the counterpart railroad vehicle to be set with further accuracy.
</li>
<li>(6) More preferably, the second brake controller includes a release valve device configured to transmit the brake pipe pressure from the second relay valve, and the release valve device is configured to be capable of readily releasing fluid from the main brake pipe.
<br/>
With this configuration, when driving the brake actuator of the counterpart railroad vehicle, the brake pipe pressure may be promptly reduced from the railroad vehicle brake device.
</li>
<li>(7) More preferably, the release valve device includes a main release valve, and the main release valve is configured to be capable of readily releasing fluid from the main brake pipe when operating an emergency brake.
<br/>
With this configuration, when activating the emergency brake that generates the strongest braking force, the pressure of the brake pipe in the counterpart railroad vehicle can be promptly reduced. Thus, the braking force can be promptly applied.
</li>
<li>(8) Preferably, the release valve device includes an electromagnetic valve, and the electromagnetic valve is configured to be capable of readily releasing fluid from the main brake pipe based on an emergency brake operation command of the railroad vehicle.
<br/>
With this configuration, the electromagnetic valve opens based on an emergency brake command of the primary vehicle. Thus, the pressure of the main brake pipe, that is, the pressure of the brake pipe in the counterpart railroad vehicle, can be forcibly exhausted. This allows for the brakes to be promptly applied on the counterpart railroad vehicle.
</li>
<li>(9) Preferably, the second brake controller includes a bypass pipe and a one-way valve. The bypass pipe is connected to the main brake pipe. The bypass pipe bypasses the release valve device. The one-way valve is arranged in the bypass pipe. The one-way valve restricts pressure transmission toward the second valve device in the bypass pipe.
<br/>
With this configuration, when the brake pressure from the brake pipe of the counterpart railroad vehicle acts on the main brake pipe, the fluid of the main brake pipe can be circulated to the release<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> valve device. This maintains the release valve device in the same state.
</li>
<li>(10) Preferably, the second brake controller includes a constriction that partially decreases an inner diameter of the main brake pipe, and the second brake controller is configured so that fluid that has passed through the constriction in the main brake pipe is supplied via the second relay valve to the brake pipe of the counterpart railroad vehicle.
<br/>
With this configuration, the amount of fluid per unit time supplied from the main brake pipe to the brake pipe of the counterpart railroad vehicle is restricted so as not to become greater than or equal to a predetermined amount. As a result, for example, when an automatic brake valve or a conductor valve (not shown) is operated in the counterpart railroad vehicle, as long as the supplied amount of fluid is greater than the released amount, reduction in the pressure of the brake pipe is further ensured. As a result, the application of brakes to the counterpart railroad vehicle by the operation of the automatic brake valve or the like is further ensured. Further, the restriction is arranged so that the operation of the second relay valve does not affect the responsiveness of changes in the brake pipe pressure. This allows the brake pipe pressure to be promptly changed.
</li>
<li>(11) Preferably, the railroad vehicle brake device includes a pressure detector that detects the brake pipe pressure of the counterpart railroad vehicle, and the first valve device is capable of outputting the drive pressure, which is set based on the brake pipe pressure, from the first gate to the brake actuator.
<br/>
With this configuration, for example, when the counterpart railroad vehicle tows the primary vehicle, the brake pipe pressure of the counterpart railroad vehicle, that is, the drive force corresponding to the braking amount of the counterpart railroad vehicle can be generated at the first valve device. Thus, when the counterpart railroad vehicle tows the primary vehicle, the brake device of the counterpart railroad vehicle and the brake device of the primary vehicle cooperate to further promptly apply brakes to the counterpart railroad vehicle and the primary vehicle.
</li>
<li>(12) To achieve the above object, a railroad vehicle according to one aspect of the present invention includes the railroad vehicle brake device described above.
<br/>
With this configuration, even in a configuration that does not use a brake pipe to apply brakes to the railroad vehicle, the brake device for a counterpart railroad vehicle that includes a brake pipe can be used.
</li>
<li>(13) To achieve the above object, a railroad vehicle formation according to one aspect of the present invention includes a plurality of railroad vehicles coupled one after another and the railroad vehicle brake device described above. The railroad vehicle brake device is arranged in one or both of a head vehicle and a trailing vehicle among the rail road vehicles.
<br/>
With this configuration, even in a configuration that does not use a brake pipe to apply brakes to the railroad vehicle, the brake device for a counterpart railroad vehicle that includes a brake pipe can be used. Further, among the railroad vehicles, the brake pipe for using the brake device of the counterpart railroad vehicle is arranged in only the vehicle that can be coupled to the counterpart railroad vehicle. This simplifies the structure of the railroad vehicle formation.

<p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram of a railroad vehicle formation 10 including a railroad vehicle brake device according to one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram of a counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 that is a railroad vehicle formation separate from the railroad vehicle formation 10. Referring to <figref idref="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">2</figref>, the railroad vehicle formation 10 is formed by, for example, passenger vehicles or the like. The railroad vehicle formation 10 includes a head vehicle 11, intermediate vehicles 12, and a trailing vehicle 13, which are vehicles coupled one after another. There is one intermediate vehicle 12 or multiple intermediate vehicles 12 (in the present embodiment, multiple).</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The vehicles 11, 12, and 13 each include an electric command cable 14. Further, the vehicles 11, 12, and 13 each include a main reservoir pipe (MRP) 15. The main reservoir pipes 15 run throughout each of the vehicles 11, 12, and 13. The main reservoir pipes 15 are filled with compressed air, which is compressed by an air compressor (not shown). The main reservoir pipes 15 of the head vehicle 11 and the trailing vehicle 13 respectively include sluice valves 18 and 19. The sluice valves 18 and 19 are closed when the railroad vehicle formation 10 travels solely. When the railroad vehicle formation 10 is connected to the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100, the corresponding sluice valves 18 and 19 are open.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The head vehicle 11 includes a railroad vehicle brake device 20. The trailing vehicle 13 also includes a railroad vehicle brake device 20 (hereafter, simply referred to as the brake device 20).<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> The brake device 20 of the head vehicle 11 and the brake device 20 of the trailing vehicle 13 have identical configurations. Thus, the description will focus on the brake device 20 of the trailing vehicle 13, and the brake device 20 of the head vehicle 11 will not be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In the present embodiment, the railroad vehicle brake device 20 uses the configuration of an electric commanding air brake device to apply the brakes on the railroad vehicle formation 10. Further, the railroad vehicle brake device 20 uses the configuration of an automatic air brake device to apply the brakes on the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The brake device 20 includes a brake setting unit 21, a brake actuator 22, a first brake controller 23, and a second brake controller 24.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The brake setting unit 21 is used to set the braking force for each of the vehicles 11, 12, and 13. The brake setting unit 21 is configured to be operated by a driver or the like of the railroad vehicle formation 10. When operated by the driver, the brake setting unit 21 outputs a first electric command E11 and a second electric command E21, which serve as electric signals. The brake setting unit 21, for example, synchronously outputs the first electric command E11 and the second electric command E21. However, the first electric command E11 and the second electric command E21 may be independently output. The command contents of the first electric command E11 and the second electric command E21 are, for example, a brake release command, a normal braking command, or an emergency braking command.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The brake release command refers to a command that releases the applied brakes. The normal braking command refers to a command that applies the brakes with a braking force designated by the driver. The emergency braking command refers to a command that applies the brakes with the maximum set braking force.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The brake setting unit 21 outputs the first electric command E11 to the first brake controller 23 through the electric command cable 14 and outputs the second electric command E21 to the second brake controller 24 through the electric command cable 14. When receiving the first electric command E11, the first brake controller 23 operates the brake actuator 22.</p>

<p id="p0086" num="0086">The third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 is, for example, a motor-operated valve. The third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 sets the open amount of the valve 131 to a value corresponding to the third electro-pneumatic conversion command E32. The third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 is located in an intermediate portion of the third control pipe 132.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">The third control pipe 132 is branched from the drive pressure pipe 126. The fluid pressure P10 of the main reservoir pipe 115 is converted at the third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 to the third control pressure P31. The dual check valve 133, which is supplied with the third control pressure P31, is connected to the intermediate portion of the third control pipe 132.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">The dual check valve 133 is a valve including two input ports and one output port. When fluids having different pressures are respectively supplied to the two input ports, the dual check valve 133 is configured to supply the output port with the fluid having the larger pressure. One of the input ports of the dual check valve 133, which is connected to the third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 by the third control pipe 132, receives the third control pressure P31. The output port of the dual check valve 133 is connected to the variable load valve 134.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">The variable load valve 134 is connected by the air spring pressure intake pipe 128 to an air spring (not shown), which serves as a suspension device of the trailing vehicle 113, and transmits the pressure of the air chamber of the air spring. The variable load valve 134 outputs a third control pressure P31', which corresponds to the pressure of the air spring, or a fourth control pressure P41', which will be described later, to the third relay valve 135.</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">The third relay valve 135 is a valve operated when provided with the third control pressure P31' or the fourth control pressure P41'. The third relay valve 135 is connected to an intermediate portion of the drive pressure pipe 126. The third relay valve 135 includes a third gate 135a. The third gate 135a is continuously connected to the interior of the drive pressure pipe 126. The condition of the fluid passing through the drive pressure pipe 126 changes in accordance with the open amount of the third gate 135a. In the present embodiment, the third relay valve 135 sets the open<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> amount of the third gate 135a in correspondence with the third control pressure P31' or the fourth control pressure P41'.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">In the structure described above, the third valve device 127 converts the fluid pressure P101 from the main reservoir pipe 115 to the drive pressure P30. Then, the third valve device 127 outputs the drive pressure P30 from the third gate 135a to the brake actuator 122.</p>

<p id="p0093" num="0093">The fourth brake controller 124 includes the brake pipe 116, a distribution valve 141, an auxiliary tank 142, and an action chamber 143.</p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">The brake pipe 116 includes first to fourth pipes 116a to 116d. In the brake pipe 116, the first pipe 116a runs throughout each of the vehicles 111, 112, and 113. The second pipe 116b is branched from the first pipe 116a and connected to the distribution valve 141.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">The distribution valve 141 is used as a portion that distributes the brake pipe pressure BP. The distribution valve 141 is connected by the third pipe 116c to the auxiliary tank 142. The distribution valve 141 is connected by the fourth pipe 116d to the other one of the ports of the dual check valve 133. The action chamber 143 is connected to the fourth pipe 116d. This forms an action chamber volume balanced with the volume of the auxiliary tank 142.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">The distribution valve 141 distributes the air in the first pipe 116a of the brake pipe 116 to the auxiliary tank 142 when supplied with the brake pipe pressure BP such as when the automatic brake valve 106 is in a relaxed position (braking force not applied). The distribution valve 141 distributes the compressed air from the auxiliary tank 142 via the fourth pipe 116d to the dual check valve 133 when the automatic brake valve 106 is at a brake application position (braking force applied) and the brake pipe pressure BP is reduced in the first pipe 116a. This converts the brake pressure in the auxiliary tank 142 to the fourth control pressure P41. Further, the brake pressure in the auxiliary tank 142 is converted to the fourth control pressure P41' by the dual check valve 133 and the variable load valve 134. The fourth control pressure P41' is output to the third relay valve 135.</p>

<p id="p0098" num="0098">One example of the operation of the brake devices 20 and 120 when the railroad vehicle formation 10 and the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 are coupled will now be described. More specifically, under a situation in which the railroad vehicle formation 10 is towing the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100, descriptions will be given for (1) the brake releasing operation, (2) the normal brake operation, and (3) the emergency brake operation. A further description will be given of (4) the operation of the brake device 20 when the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is towing the railroad vehicle formation 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">Operations (1) to (4) will be described under the assumption that the coupler 16 of the railroad vehicle formation 10 and the coupler 118 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 are coupled to each other. Hereafter, among the portions where the fluid pressure is acting, the locations referred to in the description are shown by thick lines.</p>
<heading id="h0016">[(1) Brake releasing operation when railroad vehicle formation 10 is towing counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100J</heading>
<p id="p0100" num="0100"><figref idref="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a diagram showing one example of the operation of the railroad vehicle formation 10. <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a diagram showing one example of the operation of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. Referring to <figref idref="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idref="f0005">5</figref>, in the case of condition (1), in the first brake controller 23 of the brake device 20, the fluid pressure P10 of the main reservoir pipe 15 acting in the drive pressure pipe 26 reaches the first electro-pneumatic conversion valve 31 and the first relay valve 34 of the first brake controller 23. In the second brake controller 24, the second electro-pneumatic conversion valve 49 outputs the second control pressure P21. This opens the second relay valve 50. As a result, the fluid pressure P10 from the main reservoir pipe 15 is converted to the brake pipe pressure BP in the second relay valve 50 and transmitted via the release valve device 43 and the couplers 16 and 118 to the first pipe 116a of the brake pipe 116. As a result, the air from the second relay valve 50 is collected in the auxiliary air tank 142 via the distribution valve 141. In the third brake controller 123, the fluid pressure P10 transmitted to the main reservoir pipe 115 via the main reservoir pipe 15 acts in the drive pressure pipe 126 reaching the third electro-pneumatic conversion valve 131 and the third relay valve 135.</p>
<heading id="h0017">[(2) Normal brake operation when railroad vehicle formation 10 is towing counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100]</heading>
<p id="p0101" num="0101"><figref idref="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a diagram showing one example of the operation of the railroad vehicle formation 10. <figref idref="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a diagram showing one example of the operation of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. Referring to <figref idref="f0006">Figs. 6</figref> and <figref idref="f0007">7</figref>, in the case of condition (2), when the driver of the railroad vehicle formation 10 operates the brake setting unit 21, the brake setting unit 21 generates a normal brake command as the first electric command E11 and the second electric command E21. As a result, in the first brake controller 23, the first control pressure P12 from the first electro-magnetic conversion valve 31 is transmitted to the first relay valve 34. This opens the first gate 34a of the first relay valve 34 by a predetermined amount, and the drive pressure P11 corresponding to the braking command value of the first electric command E11 is transmitted from the first relay valve 34 to the brake actuator 22.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">Further, in the second brake controller 24, the second electro-pneumatic conversion valve 49 changes the second control pressure P21 to decrease the brake pipe pressure BP output from the second relay valve 50. As a result, the open degree of the second relay valve 50, for example, decreases. This also decreases the brake pipe pressure BP of the brake pipe 116 in the fourth brake controller 124 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. In the fourth brake controller 124, the distribution valve 141 supplies compressed air from the auxiliary tank 142 to the dual check valve 133 in correspondence with the decreased pressure amount. As a result, the fourth control pressure P41 acts on the variable load valve 134, and the fourth control pressure P41' output from the variable load valve 134 acts on the third relay valve 135. This transmits the drive pressure P30, which corresponds to the control command value of the second electric command E21, from the third relay valve 135 to the brake actuator 122.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">In a normal brake operation, the brake setting unit 21 sets the first electric command E11 so that the timing for starting the supply of the drive pressure P11 to the brake actuator 22 is delayed by a predetermined time from the timing for starting the supply of the brake pipe pressure BP from the second relay valve 50. Thus, the first relay valve 34 supplies the drive pressure P11 to the brake actuator 22 after a predetermined time (e.g., several seconds) elapses from when the brake pipe pressure BP received from the brake controller 24 is reduced.</p>
<heading id="h0018">[(3) Emergency brake operation when railroad vehicle formation 10 is towing counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100]</heading>
<p id="p0104" num="0104"><figref idref="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram showing one example of the operation of the railroad vehicle formation 10. Referring to <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, in the case of condition (3), when the driver of the railroad vehicle formation 10 operates the brake setting unit 21, the brake setting unit 21 generates an emergency braking command as the first electric command E11 and the second electric command E21. This opens the operation electromagnetic valve 39 in the first brake controller 23. As a result, the pressure received from the main reservoir pipe 15 via the pressure adjustment valve 36 or the pressure adjustment valve 37 (in <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, for example, pressure adjustment valve 37) is supplied to the first relay valve 34 via the switch electromagnetic valve 38, the operation electromagnetic valve 39, and the dual check valve 33. Thus, the drive pressure P11 of the main reservoir pipe 15 is converted to the first control pressure P12' and applied to the first relay valve 34. This greatly opens the first gate 34a of the first relay valve 34, and the maximum drive pressure P11 that can be set is transmitted from the first relay valve 34 to the brake actuator 22.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105">Further, in the second brake controller 24, the electromagnetic release valve 54, which has received the second electric command E21, opens and releases pressure to the outside via the main release valve 53. This promptly decreases the brake pipe pressure BP. In this case, the operation of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is the same as the case of condition (2) and thus will not be described.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">In an emergency brake operation, the brake setting unit 21 conforms the timing for starting the supply of the drive pressure P11 to the brake actuator 22 to the timing for starting the release of the brake pipe pressure BP from the electromagnetic release valve 54. This allows the emergency brake operation to be promptly started.</p>
<heading id="h0019">[(4) Operation of brake device 20 of railroad vehicle formation 10 when counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is towing railroad vehicle formation 10]</heading>
<p id="p0107" num="0107"><figref idref="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating one example of the operation of the railroad vehicle formation 10. Referring to <figref idref="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>, in the case of condition (4), the main reservoir pipe 15 and the main brake pipe 41 of the railroad vehicle formation are respectively connected to the main reservoir pipe 115 and the brake pipe 116 (not shown in <figref idref="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>) of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. In this case, the second relay valve 50 is closed, and the brake pipe pressure BP acts on a portion of the main brake pipe 41 in the second brake controller 24 and on the pressure intake pipe 66. The driver of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 operates the automatic brake valve 106 to change the brake pipe pressure BP. The pressure sensor 67 outputs the pressure detection value D21 of the brake pipe pressure BP to the brake control unit 30. The brake control unit 30 generates the first electric command E11 based on the pressure detection value D21 of the brake pipe pressure BP. The brake control unit 30 is capable of outputting the first electro-pneumatic conversion command<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> E12 based on the first electric command E11. Further, the brake control unit 30 is capable of outputting the first electric command E11 as an emergency braking command via the electric command cable 14 to the emergency brake device 29. This performs the normal brake operation and the emergency brake operation, which are described above, with the brake device 20.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">As described above, the brake device 20 of the present embodiment realizes the configuration of an electric commanding air brake device in the railroad vehicle formation 10. Further, the brake device 20 is able to use the third brake controller 123 as an automatic air brake device with the brake pipe 116 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. More specifically, the brake device 20 is able to drive the brake actuator to generate braking force corresponding to the command value of the first electric command E11. Further, based on the second electric command E21, the brake device 20 is able to set the brake pipe 116 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 to the brake pipe pressure BP. In this manner, even though the railroad vehicle formation 10 does not use a brake pipe to apply brakes on the railroad vehicle formation 10, the brake device 120 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 that includes the brake pipe 116 can be used. As a result, the railroad vehicle formation 10 and the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 may be slowed down further promptly. This allows for the vehicles to be transported further promptly.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">In the brake device 20, the first relay valve 34 is able to set the open amount of the first gate 34a in accordance with the first control pressure P12 from the first electro-pneumatic conversion valve 31. In this configuration, in correspondence with the first control pressure P12, which is the pilot pressure, the first relay valve 34 outputs fluid having the necessary volume to the brake actuator 22 as the drive pressure P11 corresponding to the first electric command E11. Thus, the structure of the first electro-pneumatic conversion valve 31, which is formed by an electromagnetic valve or the like, is reduced in size.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">In the brake device 20, the second valve device 42 is able to set the brake pipe pressure BP to a value associated with the value of the drive pressure P11. In this configuration, the drive pressure P11, which is supplied to the brake actuator 22, and the brake pipe pressure BP are associated with each other. Thus, the brake device 20 ensures further conformance of the braking condition of the railroad vehicle formation and the braking condition of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. As a result, the brake devices 20 and 120 cooperate to further promptly slow down the railroad vehicle formation 10 and the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">In the brake device 20, the first valve device 27 is configured so that during a normal brake operation, the drive pressure P11 is supplied to the brake actuator 22 after a predetermined time elapses from when the brake pipe pressure BP from the second brake controller 24 is reduced. In this configuration, the first valve device 27 outputs the drive pressure P11 when receiving the first electric command E11, which is an electric signal, and operates the brake actuator 22. Thus, the time from when the first valve device 27 receives the first electric command to when the drive force P11 is output is short, and the first valve device 27 has high responsiveness. In the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100, the brake actuator 122 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is operated in accordance with changes in the pressure of the brake pipe 116. Thus, in the brake device 120, the propagation speed of a pressure change in the brake pipe 116 is slower than the propagation speed of an electric signal, and the responsiveness is relatively low. Taking such characteristics into consideration, the point of time for starting the supply of the drive pressure P11 from the first valve device 27 is later than the point of time for starting reduction of the brake pipe<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> pressure BP from the second valve device 42. This increases the degree of conformance of the operation timing of the brake actuator 22 and the operation timing of the brake actuator 122. As a result, when applying the brakes, the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 does not excessively push the railroad vehicle formation 10. Thus, the couplers 16 and 118 are not adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">In the brake device 20, the second relay valve 50 sets the open amount of the second gate 50a in correspondence with the second control pressure P21 from the second electro-pneumatic conversion valve 49. This configuration allows the brake pipe pressure BP and the necessary air amount to be generated in correspondence with the second electric command E21, which serves as an electric signal. Thus, the brake device 20 is able to set the braking amount of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">In the brake device, the release valve device 43 is configured to be capable of readily (intentionally) releasing fluid from the brake pipe 116 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. This configuration allows the brake device 20 of the railroad vehicle formation to readily reduce the brake pipe pressure BP during an emergency brake operation when driving the brake actuator 122 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In the brake device 20, the electromagnetic release valve 54 opens based on an emergency braking command, which serves as the second electric command E21, to forcibly reduce the pressure of the brake pipe 116 in the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. This allows the brakes to be applied further promptly on the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">The brake device 20 includes the one-way valve in the bypass pipe 44. In this configuration, the fluid in the brake pipe 116 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 can be circulated to the main release valve 53 of the release valve device 43. This maintains the release valve device 43 in the same state.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">The brake device 20 includes the first constriction 52 in the main brake pipe 41. In this configuration, the amount of fluid per unit time supplied from the main brake pipe 41 to the brake pipe 116 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is restricted so as not to become greater than a predetermined amount. As a result, for example, when the automatic brake valve 106 or a conductor valve (not shown) is operated in the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100, as long as the supplied amount of fluid is greater than the released amount, reduction in the pressure of the brake pipe 116 is further ensured. As a result, the application of brakes to the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 by the operation of the automatic brake valve 106 or the like is further ensured. Further, the first constriction 52 is arranged so that the operation of the second relay valve 50 does not affect the responsiveness of changes in the brake pipe pressure BP. This allows the brake pipe pressure BP to be promptly changed.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">In the brake device 20, the first valve device 27 is able to output the drive pressure P11, which is set based on the brake pipe pressure BP, from the first gate 34a to the brake actuator 22. For example, when the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 tows the railroad vehicle formation 10, this configuration allows the brake control unit 30 to generate the first electric command E12 in correspondence with the brake pipe pressure BP of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100, that is, the braking amount of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. Thus, when the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 tows the railroad vehicle formation 10, the brake device 20<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> cooperates with the brake device 120 so that the brakes may be further promptly applied on the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 and the railroad vehicle formation 10.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">As described above, even when a brake pipe is not used to apply the brakes to the railroad vehicle formation 10, the brake device 20 allows for use of the brake device 120 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 that includes the brake pipe 116.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">In the railroad vehicle formation 10, among the vehicles 11, 12, and 13, the brake device 20 is arranged in one or both of the head vehicle 11 and the trailing vehicle 13. In this configuration, among the vehicles 11, 12, and 133, the second brake controller 24 for using the brake device 120 of the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100 is arranged in only the vehicle that can be directly coupled to the counterpart railroad vehicle formation 100. This simplifies the structure of the railroad vehicle formation 10.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">One embodiment of the present invention has been described above.
