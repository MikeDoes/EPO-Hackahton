<heading id="h0001"><b>1. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy using acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) for the treatment of human subjects having acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), and, in particular, the non-neurological manifestations of Niemann Pick Disease (NPD), and in certain embodiments, NPD type B.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>2. <u>BACKGROUND</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Acid sphingomyelinase, E.C. 3.1.4.12, (ASM) is a lysosomal phosphodiesterase enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, a phospholipid storage substance found in the brain, liver, lungs, spleen and lymph nodes, to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Deficiencies in ASM activity result in the inability of the body to break down sphingomyelin, causing a form of the lysosomal storage disease termed Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Niemann-Pick disease is an inherited autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of sphingomyelin in the lysosomes of cells such as macrophages and neurons, which impairs normal cellular function. Niemann-Pick Type A is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease in infants and typically results in death within two to three years of age. Niemann-Pick Type B results in the enlargement of the liver and spleen, and respiratory distress with death generally ensuing by early adulthood. These two forms of Niemann-Pick disease which are both associated with ASM deficiencies are referred to collectively herein as Niemann-Pick disease, or ASM deficiency (ASMD). Other types of Niemann-Pick disease, <i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., Type C, do not involve mutations in the ASM gene and are not directly attributable to the function of ASM. The nature of the biochemical and molecular defects that underlie the remarkable clinical heterogeneity of the A and B subtypes remains unknown. Although patients with both subtypes have residual ASM activity (about 1 to 10% of normal),<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> biochemical analysis cannot reliably distinguish the two phenotypes. Moreover, the clinical course of Type B NPD is highly variable, and it is not presently possible to correlate disease severity with the level of residual ASM activity.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">NPD occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. It is estimated that the incidence of the type A disease among Ashkenazi Jews is about 1 in 40,000, a gene frequency (q) of about 1 in 200, and a heterozygote carrier frequency (2 pq) of 1 in 100 (Goodman, 1979, in "Genetic Disorders Among The Jewish People", John Hopkins Univ. Press, Baltimore, pp. 96-100). The heterozygote carrier incidence of type B NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is less frequent (Goodman, supra). The combined heterozygote carrier frequency for types A and B NPD has been estimated to be about 1 in 70 among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Although the enzymatic diagnosis of affected patients with either type A or B NPD can be made reliably (Spence and Callahan, supra), the enzymatic detection of obligate heterozygotes has proven problematic, particularly using peripheral leukocytes as the enzyme source. Presumably, the occurrence of neutral sphingomyelinases in some sources and/or the presence of residual ASM activity resulting from the mutant allele have contributed to the inability to reliably discriminate carriers for either disease subtype. Even the use of cultured skin fibroblasts, which do not express the neutral sphingomyelinase, has not provided unambiguous results with heterozygotes. In epidemiologic studies conducted in individual countries, the combined incidence of Niemann-Pick A and B disease in several countries in the world is estimated to range from 1 in 167,000 to 1 in 250,000 newborns (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Miekle et al., 1999 JAMA 281(3):249-254</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Poorthuis et al., 1999 Hum Genet 105:151-156</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Pinto et al., 2004 Euro. J. Hum. Gene. 12:87-92</text></nplcit>). The heterozygote carrier rate is believed to range from 1 in 200 to 1 in 250 individuals.</p>

<p id="p0010" num="0010">Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for other lysosomal storage diseases. Enzyme replacement therapy attempts to supplement the deficient enzyme activity with exogenously supplied enzyme. In the case of enzyme replacement therapy for Niemann-Pick disease, the goal would be to enable the affected individual to process sphingomyelin and avoid its buildup within the lysosomes. To be effective, such therapy initially would require a sufficiently large amount of the replacement enzyme to break down the accumulated sphingomyelin as well as continued administration of replacement enzyme to avoid further accumulation of sphingomyelin.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>

</ol></p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, the successively higher doses of rhASM are administered one, two, three or four weeks after the previous dose.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment, the successively higher dose of rhASM is administered two weeks after the previous dose.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the dose escalating regimen comprises the following sequential doses:

<li>a. 0.1 mg/kg rhASM,</li>
<li>b. 0.3 mg/kg rhASM,</li>

</ol>
wherein: (i) each dose may be administered two or more times, (ii) each dose is administered at two week intervals, and (iii) the subject is monitored for one or more moderate or severe adverse events before elevating the dose to the next level.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to the human subject a further sequential dose of 2 mg/kg rhASM and/or 3 mg/kg rhASM.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the human subject a maintenance regimen, wherein the maintenance regimen comprises administering of a dose equal to or less than the highest dose tolerated by the human subject.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the highest dose tolerated by the human subject is 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg rhASM.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment, the maintenance regimen comprises administering the dose of 1 mg/kg rhASM, 2 mg/kg rhASM, or 3 mg/kg rhASM.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment, the maintenance regimen comprises administering the dose every two weeks.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, the dose is administered intravenously.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment, the human subject is a human adult.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, the human subject is a human child.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">In one embodiment, the human subject is 10 to 18 years old.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment, the ASMD is Niemann Pick Disease (NPD) type B.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment, the ASMD is non-neuronopathic ASMD.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The invention relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of human subjects having ASMD - particularly subjects having non-neurological manifestations of NPD, and in particular embodiments, NPD type B. More particularly, the enzyme, ASM, is administered to such patients at an initial low, non-toxic dose that is then escalated in subsequent administrations. The highest dose of ASM tolerated by the patient can then be used as a maintenance dose. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective dose less than the highest dose tolerated can be used as a maintenance dose.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that doses of ASM that would be required to clear accumulated sphingomyelin substrate in human subjects, <i>i.e.,</i> ASMD patients or Niemann-Pick patients, result in toxic side effects (including clinical signs of toxicity). This is especially surprising in the less severe form of ASMD, NPD type B patients who are deficient but have at least some enzyme activity.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">More particularly, treatment of NPD would require doses high enough to achieve adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme in organs of pathology (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., in particular, the liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney and brain). Studies in an ASM knockout mouse model (ASKMO mice) showed that the majority of recombinant human ASM (rhASM) administered distributes to the liver and spleen where it reduces substrate, but to a much lesser extent in lung, heart and brain (<nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Miranda et al. FASEB 2000, 14:1988</text></nplcit>; <i>see also,</i> Figure 9B of <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>He et al., 1999, Biochimica et Biophsyica Acta 1432: 251-264</text></nplcit>). In subsequent studies using higher doses of rhASM in the ASMKO mouse model, substrate was reduced and toxicity was not observed at doses ≤3.0 mg/kg; in fact, clinical symptoms of toxicity was not observed until doses ≥10 mg/kg were used. <i>See,</i> "<nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="b"><text>Dose Responsive Toxicological Findings Following Intravenous Administration of Recombinant Human Acid Sphingomyelinase (rhASM) to Acid Sphingomyelinase Knock-out (ASMKO) Mice.

<p id="p0029" num="0029">Based on these ASKMO data, we treated non-neuronopathic ASMD human subjects with a conservative maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg rhASM as described in Section 6, <i>infra.</i> Quite unexpectedly, toxicity in the human subjects, including the onset of related adverse events with clinical symptoms, was observed using doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg! This result was especially surprising, since the ASM enzyme is absent in the knock out mouse model which should reflect a more severe condition than in these human subjects having at least some enzyme activity and relatively mild disease.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">While not intended to be bound by any theory, the toxic side effects that occur with ASM treatment may result from breakdown of stored sphingomyelin substrate in the ASMD patient and release of the product, ceramide that is pro-apoptotic and induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response and hyperbilirubinemia. To address this issue, we have developed a regimen to allow for the safe administration of high doses of the ASM enzyme required to achieve adequate distribution in organs of pathology. In accordance with this regimen, initial treatment with ASM at very low doses is used to achieve a slow degradation of the stored substrate which is accompanied by fewer side effects. As the substrate is depleted in the subject (as the storage substrate is "debulked"), the dose can be escalated safely.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">In accordance with this protocol, a low, non-toxic dose of the ASM enzyme is initially administered to a NPD disease patient and the dose is escalated over time. As the dose of the ASM enzyme is escalated, the patient can be monitored for total bilirubin concentration, the production of acute phase reactants, the production of inflammatory mediators, and related adverse events. The administration of a low dose of ASM and the escalation of the dose facilitates the debulking of the accumulated sphingomyelin. Once the patient is debulked, higher doses may be safely administered to the patient to ensure adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme to target organs (e.g., liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney, brain, bone marrow, skeleton, joints, etc.). In certain embodiments, the maximum dose tolerated by the patient can be used as the maintenance dose. In some embodiments, based upon a patient's condition, the maintenance dose may be increased or decreased over time.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In certain embodiments, treatment of the patient is monitored by measuring the plasma sphingomyelin levels, plasma ceramide levels, the production of "acute phase reactants" and inflammatory mediators that are a measure of inflammatory responses,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> bilirubin concentrations (total, direct, and indirect), and/or other biochemical markers to ensure a stable response before elevating the dose to the next level. These markers include, but are not limited to C-reactive protein (CRP) or high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), cytokines (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., IL-8, IL-6), calcitonin and ferritin. In specific embodiments, the patient may be monitored for one or more related adverse events, which may include, but are not limited to, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting, pain, myalgia) and jaundice.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Doses less than 1mg/kg are preferable for initiating treatment. The initial dose is successively elevated until a therapeutic dose is achieved. Such dose escalation can be used to determine the highest tolerated dose.

<heading id="h0006"><b>5. <u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The present invention provides a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM) for use in a method of treating an acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in a human subject, comprising a dose escalation regimen comprising:
<ol id="ol0003" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>a. administering to the human subject one or more initial doses of rhASM, wherein the initial dose ranges between 0.001 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg rhASM; and</li>
<li>b. administering successively higher doses of rhASM to the human subject, if the subject does not manifest one or more moderate or severe adverse events that has/have a causal relationship with the treatment, wherein the successively higher doses are from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg rhASM higher than the previous dose, or 0.1 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg rhASM higher than the previous dose.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The invention generally relates to dose escalation enzyme replacement therapy for use in a method of treating human subjects having ASMD - particularly subjects having non-neurological manifestations of NPD, and in certain embodiments, NPD type B. More particularly, the enzyme, ASM, is administered to such patients at an initial low, non-toxic dose that is then escalated in subsequent administrations. The highest dose of ASM tolerated by the patient can then be used as a maintenance dose. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective dose less than the highest dose tolerated can be used as a maintenance dose.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">Treatment of NPD requires doses high enough to achieve adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme in organs of pathology (<i>e.g.,</i> the spleen, lungs, heart, kidney and brain). Following intravenous administration of recombinant human ASM in ASMKO mice, most of the ASM activity distributes to the liver with small amounts of ASM enzymatic activity detected in other organs of pathology, such as the spleen, heart, kidney and lung (<i>see, e.g.,</i> Figure 9B of <nplcit id="ncit0014" npl-type="s"><text>He et al., 1999, Biochimia et Biophsyica Acta 1432: 251-264</text></nplcit>). Thus very high doses would be required to ensure distribution and delivery of the administered enzyme to the lung, heart and kidney in patients afflicted with ASMD or Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">Studies in an ASM knockout mouse model (ASKMO mice) showed that the majority of rhASM administered distributes to the liver and spleen where it reduces substrate, but to a much lesser extent in lungs, heart and brain (<nplcit id="ncit0015" npl-type="s"><text>Miranda et al. FASEB<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> 2000, 14:1988</text></nplcit>). In subsequent studies using higher doses of rhASM in the ASMKO mouse model, substrate was reduced and toxicity was not observed at doses ≤3.0 mg/kg; in fact, clinical symptons of toxicity were not observed until doses ≥10 mg/kg were used. <i>See,</i> "<nplcit id="ncit0016" npl-type="b"><text>Dose Responsive Toxicological Findings Following Intravenous Administration of Recombinant Human Acid Sphingomyelinase (rhASM) to Acid Sphingomyelinase Knock-out (ASMKO) Mice," C. Nickerson, J. Murray, A. Vitsky, M. Hawes, S. Ryan, P. Ewing, B. Thurberg, L. Andrews. Dept Pharm/Tox, Pathology, Genzyme Corp., Framingham, MA., American Society of Human Genetics 2005</text></nplcit>; and "<nplcit id="ncit0017" npl-type="b"><text>Elevations of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines and Decreases in Cardiovascular Hemodynamics Following Intravenous Administration of Recombinant Human Acid Sphingomyelinase (rhASM) to Acid Sphingomyelinase Knock-out (ASMKO) Mice," J.

Pharmacology/Toxicology &amp; Pathology, Genzyme Corp., Framingham, MA., Society of Toxicology 2006</text></nplcit></p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">Based on these ASKMO data, we treated non-neuronopathic ASMD human subjects with a conservative maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg as described in Section 6, <i>infra.</i> Quite unexpectedly, toxicity in the human subjects, including the onset of adverse events with clinical symptoms, was observed using doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg! This result was especially surprising, since the ASM enzyme is absent in the knock out mouse model which should reflect a more severe condition than the human subjects who have at least some enzyme activity and relatively mild disease.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">Without being bound by any theory, the administration of high doses of ASM to NPD patients can result in the hydrolysis of large amounts of sphingomyelin into large concentrations of ceramide, which may produce the toxic side effects observed in those NPD patients. The ASM enzyme hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, which is a major component of the plasma membrane of cells (<i>see, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0018" npl-type="s"><text>Milaus et al., 2010 FEBS Letters 584: 1887-1894</text></nplcit>), into ceramide and phosphocholine. Ceramide is known to play a role in cell death and is known to be a pro-apoptotic agent (<i>see, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0019" npl-type="s"><text>Smith and Schuchman, 2008, FASEB 22: 3419-3431</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">Moreover, unlike other lysosomal enzymes associated with characterized lysosomal storage diseases, ASM hydrolyzes sphingomyelin at the neutral pH found in the plasma and the acidic pH found in the lysosome (<i>see, e.g.,.</i> <nplcit id="ncit0020" npl-type="s"><text>Schissel et al., 1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273: 2738-2746</text></nplcit>). The ability of the ASM enzyme to function in the plasma can result in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin found in lipoproteins and the plasma<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> membrane of cells, which can increase the amount of the breakdown product, ceramide, which may cause the toxic side effects observed in NPD patients administered high doses of ASM enzyme.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">To solve the problem of achieving adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme to the organs of pathology while avoiding or minimizing the toxicity associated with administering high doses of the enzyme, the inventors develop the regimens described herein, in which a low, non-toxic dose of the ASM enzyme is initially administered to a NPD patient and the dose is escalated over time. As the dose of the ASM enzyme is escalated, the patient can be monitored for total/direct/indirect bilirubin concentrations, the production of acute phase reactants, the production of inflammatory mediators, and related adverse events. The administration of a low dose of ASM and the escalation of the enzyme facilitates the debulking of the accumulated sphingomyelin. Once the patient is debulked, higher doses of the ASM enzyme may be safely administered to the patient to ensure adequate distribution of the ASM enzyme to target organs (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney, brain, bone marrow, skeleton, joints, etc.). In certain embodiments, the maximum dose tolerated by the patient can be used as the maintenance dose. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective dose less than the highest dose tolerated can be used as a maintenance dose. In some embodiments, based upon a patient's condition, the maintenance dose may be increased or decreased.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">In certain embodiments, treatment of the patient can be monitored by measuring the plasma sphingomyelin levels, plasma ceramide levels, the production of "acute phase reactants" and inflammatory mediators that are a measure of inflammatory responses, bilirubin concentrations (total, direct or indirect) and/or other biochemical markers to ensure a stable response before elevating the dose to the next level. These markers include, but are not limited to CRP/hs-CRP, cytokines (e.g., 1L-8, 11-6), calcitonin, and ferritin. In specific embodiments, the patient may be monitored for one or more related adverse events which may include, but is not limited to constitutional symptoms (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., fever, nausea, vomiting, pain, myalgia and jaundice).</p>
<heading id="h0007"><b>5.1. <u>DOSE ESCALATION PROTOCOL</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">Methods are described for treating ASMD involving the administration of one or more initial, low non-toxic doses of ASM to a subject to reduce the amount of sphingomyelin that has accumulated in the subject. After a certain period of time, the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> dose of ASM can be escalated until the highest dosage tolerated by the subject that is therapeutically effective is achieved. Once this dosage is identified, it can be used as the maintenance dose to treat the subject. The maintenance dose can be administered weekly, biweekly, or monthly to the subject to treat ASMD. In some embodiments, a subject receiving a maintenance dose is monitored every 3 months, every 6 months or yearly for one, two, three or all of the following: (i) a related adverse events; (ii) total/direct/indirect bilirubin concentrations; (iii) plasma ceramide concentration; or (iv) an acute phase response. If the subject experiences a related adverse event of moderate intensity (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., a related moderate adverse event), a total bilirubin concentration greater than the total bilirubin value for a human without ASMD (<i>e.g.,</i> a healthy human), a plasma ceramide concentration greater than the plasma ceramide concentration of a human without ASMD (<i>e.g.,</i> a healthy human), or an acute phase response, then the dose administered to the subject can be evaluated by a physician or other medical professional to determine whether the dose should be adjusted.</p>

In a specific embodiment, carrot cells are engineered to express ASM. In certain embodiments, algae (<i>e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) may be engineered to express ASM (<i>see, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0053" npl-type="s"><text>Rasala et al., 2010, Plant Biotechnology Journal (Published online March 7, 2010</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">Tissue and cellular uptake of ASM is mediated by both the high mannose residues (<i>e.g.,</i> in macrophages) and by mannose-6-phosphate (<i>e.g.,</i> in liver). Thus, production of ASM with altered glycan content and/or phosphorylation may be desired<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> to enhance drug distribution. For example, ASM can be produced by cells having a mutation, <i>e.g</i>., a knockout for, at least one Golgi processing mannosidase. In one embodiment, the mutation reduces the expression of the gene, reduces protein or activity levels, or alters the distribution or other post translational modifications of the mannosidase, <i>e.g</i>., the processing of the carbohydrate chains. In a specific embodiment, the mutation reduces the level of the Golgi processing mannosidase activity. The mutation can be in a class 1 processing mannosidase; a class 2 processing mannosidase; a class 1 processing mannosidase and a class 2 processing mannosidase. Class 1 processing mannosidase includes: Golgi mannosidase IA; Golgi mannosidase IB; Golgi mannosidase IC. Class 2 processing mannosidase includes: Golgi mannosidase II. <i>See, e.g</i>., <patcit id="pcit0052" dnum="WO0215927A"><text>International Patent Application Publication No. WO 02/15927</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0053" dnum="US7138262B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,138,262</text></patcit>, for methods of producing a high mannose protein.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">In certain embodiments, cells expressing ASM are cultured in the presence of mannosidase inhibitor, such as an antibody, kifunensine, swainsonine, mannostatin, 6-deoxy-1, 4- dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-mannitol (6-deoxy-DIM), or 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-1, 4-dideoxy-1, 4- imino-D-mannitol (6-deoxy-6-fluoro-DIM). The culture of ASM in the presence of such inhibitors may result in the production of a high mannose ASM. In some embodiments, the cells expressing ASM include a nucleic acid sequence, such as an antisense molecule or ribozyme, which can bind to or inactivate a cellular mannosidase nucleic acid sequence, <i>e.g</i>., mRNA, and inhibit expression of the protein. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <patcit id="pcit0054" dnum="WO0215927A"><text>International Patent Application Publication No. WO 02/15927</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0055" dnum="US7138262B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,138,262</text></patcit> for methods of producing a high mannose protein.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">In certain embodiments, the carbohydrate chains of the ASM enzyme recombinantly expressed are remodeled by sequential treatment with various enzymes, such as neuraminidase, galactosidase and .beta.-N acetylglucosaminidase. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <patcit id="pcit0056" dnum="US5549892A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,549,892</text></patcit>, for a methods for remodeling carbohydrate chains of a lysosomal enzyme.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">Uptake of ASM, mediated by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) can be enhanced by modification of ASM to produce highly phosphorylated mannose residues and M6P. For example, ASM can be modified by recombinant technology to introduce additional mannose-6-phosphate to the ASM for enhancing cellular uptake. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0054" npl-type="s"><text>Matsuoka et al., 2010 Mole. Ther. 18:1519-1526</text></nplcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --></p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">In other embodiments, ASM can be coupled to highly phosphorylated oligosaccharide derivatives containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). <i>See, e.g.,</i> <patcit id="pcit0057" dnum="US7001994B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,001,994</text></patcit>, U.S Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0058" dnum="US20100173385A"><text>US2010/0173385</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0059" dnum="WO2010075010A"><text>International Publication No. WO2010/075010</text></patcit>. In another approach, a yeast culture system can be used for the expression of recombinant ASM that contains additional highly phosphorylated mannose-6-phosphate residues. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0055" npl-type="s"><text>Akeboshi et al., 2009 Glycobiology 19(9):1002-1009</text></nplcit>.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">Once ASM has been produced, it may be isolated or purified by any method known in the art for isolation or purification of a protein, for example, by chromatography (<i>e.g.,</i> ion exchange, high performance liquid chromatography, affinity, particularly by affinity for ASM, by Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the isolation or purification of proteins. Where the ASM enzyme is secreted by the cultured cells, ASM may be readily recovered from the culture medium. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0056" npl-type="s"><text>He et al., 1999, Biochimia et Biophsyica Acta 1432: 251-264</text></nplcit> for methods for purifying ASM.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">The ASM enzyme can be formulated for any route of administration (<i>e.g.,</i> infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraventricular, intranasal, inhalation or intradermal). The ASM enzyme can be supplied in a lyophilized form that is reconstituted before use with, <i>e.g.,</i> sterile saline <i>(e.g.,</i> 0.9 % sodium chloride) or sterile water. Alternatively, the ASM enzyme can be supplied in an aqueous form. In certain embodiments, ASM is administered to a subject in a formulation comprising zinc. In some embodiments, the ASM enzyme is administered to the patient by infusion using, <i>e.g.,</i> a syringe pump or an infusion bag with a pump.</p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">In certain embodiments, ASM is administered to a subject in a carrier, such as liposomes or a polycationic carrier. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <patcit id="pcit0060" dnum="US5716614A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,716,614 </text></patcit> for a carriers that can be used to administered ASM. In some embodiments, the ASM administered to a subject in ICAM-1-target nanocarriers. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0057" npl-type="s"><text>Muro et al., 2006, Mol.

In some embodiments, the biological sample is a biological fluid such as urine. In certain embodiments, the biological sample is a sputum or nasal discharge sample. In some embodiments, the biological sample is mouth swab.</p>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">Techniques known in the art can be used to assess the presence, number, amount or percentage of a certain type(s) of cells present in a biological sample. For example, cells can be sorted using a using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is a known method for separating particles, including cells, based on the fluorescent properties of the particles. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0061" npl-type="s"><text>Kamarch, 1987, Methods Enzymol 151:150-165</text></nplcit>. Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture. An antibody or ligand used to detect an antigenic determinant present on the cell surface of particular cells is labeled with a fluorochrome, such as FITC or phycoerythrin. The cells are incubated with the fluorescently labeled antibody or ligand for a time period sufficient to allow the labeled antibody or ligand to bind to cells. The cells are processed through the cell sorter, allowing separation of the cells of interest from other cells. FACS sorted particles can be directly deposited into individual wells of microtiter plates to facilitate separation.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">Magnetic beads can be also used to separate cells. For example, cells can be sorted using a using a magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technique, a method for separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads (0.5-100 µm diameter). A variety of useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres, including covalent addition of an antibody which specifically recognizes a cell-solid phase surface molecule or hapten. A magnetic field is then applied, to physically manipulate the selected beads. In a specific embodiment, antibodies to a blood cell surface marker are coupled to magnetic beads. The beads are then mixed with the blood cell culture to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --> out cells having the blood cell surface markers of interest. These cells can then be isolated.</p>
<p id="p0179" num="0179">In some embodiments, the surface of a culture dish may be coated with antibodies, and used to separate cells by a method called panning. Separate dishes can be coated with antibody specific to particular cells. Cells can be added first to a dish coated with blood cell specific antibodies of interest. After thorough rinsing, the cells left bound to the dish will be cells that express the cell markers of interest. Examples of cell surface antigenic determinants or markers include, but are not limited to, CD2 for T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, CD3 for T lymphocytes, CD11a for leukocytes, CD28 for T lymphocytes, CD19 for B lymphocytes, CD20 for B lymphocytes, CD21 for B lymphocytes, CD22 for B lymphocytes, CD23 for B lymphocytes, CD29 for leukocytes, CD14 for monocytes, CD41 for platelets, CD61 for platelets, CD66 for granulocytes, CD67 for granulocytes and CD68 for monocytes and macrophages.</p>

<heading id="h0015"><b>6.1. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0196" num="0196">ASMD is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disorder that results when sphingomyelin is unable to be normally catabolized to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Consequently, sphingomyelin accumulates within cells primarily of the reticuloendothelial system, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and interstitial lung disease. Growth retardation and an atherogenic lipid profile also are common findings. Patients who have little to no residual ASM activity exhibit the most severe symptoms with onset in infancy, failure to thrive, neurodegeneration, and death by age 3 (Niemann-Pick disease type A, NPD A). Patients with higher amounts of residual ASM activity have variable ages of onset, heterogeneous presentations and somatic symptoms, little to no neurologic involvement, and generally survive into adulthood (NPD B). Currently, there is no treatment for patients with ASMD.</p>
<p id="p0197" num="0197">Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been successfully used to treat several lysosomal storage disorders, including Gaucher disease, Mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, and VI, Fabry disease, and Pompe disease. Recombinant human lysosomal enzymes are administered intravenously and taken up into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis for subsequent targeting to lysosomes. Proof of principle for the treatment of ASMD was demonstrated by Dr. Edward Schuchman's laboratory (Mount Sinai Medical Center) in an ASM knockout mouse (ASMKO) model where intravenous injections of recombinant human ASM (rhASM) efficiently reduced sphingomyelin levels in liver and spleen, and to a lesser extent in lung (<nplcit id="ncit0063" npl-type="s"><text>Miranda, et al., FASEB 2000;14:1988</text></nplcit>). However, sphingomyelin levels were not reduced in brain because of the inability of rhASM to cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to the fact that the ASMKO mouse has no residual ASM activity or protein and develops rapid and severe neurological disease, this animal is considered most appropriately a model of NPD - type A (see, <nplcit id="ncit0064" npl-type="s"><text>Buccinna et al., 2009, J. Neurochem. 109:105-115</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0198" num="0198">Additional studies confirmed that biweekly doses of rhASM reduced sphingomyelin levels in ASMKO mice in a dose-dependent manner (0.3-3 mg/kg). The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) for single and repeat dosing were<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> determined to be 0.3 and 3 mg/kg, respectively in ASMKO mice. Subsequent attempts to deplete sphingomyelin levels in lung with higher doses of rhASM led to unexpected toxicity. At doses ≥10 mg/kg, ASMKO mice but not normal animals experienced liver inflammation, adrenal hemorrhage, cardiovascular shock and death in the setting of very elevated cytokine levels, suggesting cytokine release syndrome. The toxicity and cytokine elevations seen with high doses of rhASM could be ameliorated or prevented by prior treatment of ASMKO mice with several lower doses of rhASM, suggesting that the rate and amount of sphingomyelin degradation plays a key role.</p>
<p id="p0199" num="0199">In the ASMKO mouse, a model for NPD-type A, toxicity was not observed following single doses of ≤ 0.3 mg/kg rhASM and repeat doses of ≤ of 3.0 mg/kg rhASM; severe toxicity was not observed until single doses ≥10 mg/kg rhASM were administered. Therefore, a conservative starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg rhASM was selected for single-dose treatment of human subjects to ensure a 10-fold safety margin with respect to the single-dose NOAEL (0.3 mg/kg) observed in ASMKO mice. A maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg rhASM was selected for single dose treatment of human subjects to ensure a 10-fold safety margin with respect to the dose at which serious toxicity was observed in the ASMKO mouse (10 mg/kg). Upon completion of the protocol set forth below, toxicity in the human subjects was unexpectedly observed with a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg rhASM.</p>

<heading id="h0017"><b>6.2.1. <u>HUMAN PROTOCOL DESIGN</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0200" num="0200">This protocol was a single-center, single-dose, dose escalation Phase 1 trial. The primary trial objectives were to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single doses of rhASM in human adults with non-neuronopathic ASMD (Niemann-Pick B). Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 mg/kg rhASM were infused sequentially by dose cohort. The original trial design called for a minimum of 15 patients (5 cohorts of 3 patients each). Due to difficulties with patient enrollment, the protocol was amended such that the first 2 cohorts enrolled 3 patients each and the last 3 cohorts were to enroll 2 patients each. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw the conduct of the trial and all protocol procedures were approved by the IRB. <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1</figref> depicts the protocol patient flow.</p>
<heading id="h0018"><b>6.2.2. <u>PATIENTS</u></b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="76"> -->
<p id="p0201" num="0201">To be eligible for the protocol, patients had to be 18-65 years of age and have deficient ASM enzyme activity, a spleen volume ≥2x normal, AST and ALT ≤250 IU/L, bilirubin ≤3.6 mg/dL, INR ≤1.5, DLco &gt;30% predicted, and platelets ≥60,000/mL. Patients were excluded if they had cirrhosis (by liver biopsy), significant cardiac disease, total splenectomy, or were taking medications or herbal supplements that were potentially hepatotoxic, promoted bleeding, or inhibited rhASM.</p>
<p id="p0202" num="0202">A total of 13 patients were enrolled and 11 patients infused with rhASM. rhASM was produced by over-expression of ASM cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The mean age of infused patients was 30.8 yrs, all were Caucasian (non-Hispanic/non-Latino), and mean spleen volume was 10.8 multiples of normal. One had a partial splenectomy; the remaining patients had intact spleens at protocol entry. <figref idref="f0002">Figure 2</figref> depicts the demography and baseline characteristics of the patients in this protocol.</p>
<p id="p0203" num="0203">Once screening was completed and eligibility was confirmed, patients were admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) overnight for baseline telemetry and infused the following morning with rhASM.

<p id="p0205" num="0205">As depicted in <figref idref="f0003">Figures 3A</figref> and <figref idref="f0004">3B</figref>, plasma ceramide levels and plasma sphingomyelin levels, respectively, were determined at several time points. Plasma ceramide levels showed a dose-dependent rise by 6 hrs and peaked at 18-72 hrs. Plasma sphingomyelin levels were normal at baseline and showed no consistent trend over time. In patient no. 12112 who received the highest dose (1 mg/kg), the plasma sphingomyelin level rose post-dose and peaked at 72 hours.</p>
<p id="p0206" num="0206"><figref idref="f0006">Figure 4</figref> depicts total bilirubin levels determined over several time points during the protocol. Total bilirubin showed a dose-related rise by 24 hrs and peaked at 48-60 hrs. The highest total bilirubin was 4.7 mg/dL in patient no. 12112 who received the highest dose (1 mg/kg). There were proportional increases in direct and indirect bilirubin. No increases were seen in ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase. There was a mild increase in GGT through 72 hrs (not shown) in two patients who received the highest (1 mg/kg, patient no. 12112) and lowest (0.03 mg/kg, patient no. 10503) doses. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were stable through the protocol, indicating that hemolysis was not responsible for elevated bilirubin levels.</p>

CRP/hs-CRP showed a transient dose-related rise by 24 hrs, peaked at 48-72 hrs, and returned to normal by Day 14. Other acute phase reactants also showed increases (% neutrophils, fibrinogen, ferritin, PT and PTT) and decreases (iron, albumin). Certain inflammatory biomarkers, e.g., the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and calcitonin, also showed substantial<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --> elevations that were dose dependent and peaked 48 hours post-infusion. Among these inflammatory mediators, the greatest changes in descending order occurred in IL 8 (peak 33.8× upper limit of normal), calcitonin (peak 33.4× upper limit of normal), CRP (peak 9.8 × upper limit of normal), and ferritin (3.9× upper limit of normal). There was no trend in platelet count or the level of fibrin-split products (not shown). The rises in laboratory acute phase reactants correlated with the constitutional clinical symptoms of fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, pain, and myalgias in some patients.</p>
<p id="p0208" num="0208"><figref idref="f0014">Figure 6</figref> is a chart of treatment emergent adverse events for four patients each on a different dose of rhASM, which events were considered to be related (possibly, probably, or definitely) to treatment. As set forth in the chart, patient no. 11509, who was given a dose of 0.3 mg/kg rhASM, exhibited moderately severe adverse events starting on day 2.</p>
<p id="p0209" num="0209">With regard to related adverse events reported in the protocol, there were no significant cardiovascular changes by telemetry, ECG, echocardiogram, or biomarkers (BNP, cardiac troponin-I, CPK-MB) or adrenal hormone dysfunction. One patient (no. 12112, 1.0 mg/kg cohort) had an elevated cortisol level in the morning 24 hours post-dose, which most likely represented a normal physiologic stress response to several ongoing moderate related adverse events. Further, four of six patients receiving ≥0.3 mg/kg rhASM experienced a total of 19 clinical and laboratory related adverse events assessed as drug-related. The intensity of related adverse events ranged from mild to severe, but most were moderate and did not require any intervention. They included fever (n=2), pain [myalgia; abdominal, leg, and hip pain] (n=2), nausea (n=2), scleral icterus and urine urobilinogen (n=1), fatigue (n=1), vomiting (n=1), lymphocytic infiltrate/hepatocellular degeneration on liver biopsy (n=1), acute phase reaction (n=4), elevated bilirubin (n=2), and increased fibrin D-dimer (n=1). The onset of clinical symptoms began 12 hours post-infusion and resolved by 72 hrs, except for hip pain in one patient that began after 72 hours. At day 14, a liver biopsy in one patient (0.6 mg/kg rhASM, patient no. 12313) showed two new foci of lymphocytic infiltrates: one was tiny (0.1 mm diameter), and the other was moderate (0.5 mm diameter) and which was associated with hepatocellular degeneration. This protocol was stopped when the first patient in cohort 5 (1 mg/kg rhASM, patient no. 12112) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity of hyperbilirubinemia (peak 4.7 mg/dL).</p>
<p id="p0210" num="0210">The results of this showed an unexpected and delayed onset of dose-related clinical and laboratory adverse events in humans suffering from ASMD at doses of<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --> rhASM of 0.3 mg/kg and higher. Further, two major safety laboratory observations were made in view of the results of this protocol. One regarding hyperbilirubinemia, in which a proportionate to dose rise in direct and indirect bilirubin was observed with no consistent markers of liver damage (AST, ALT, AP) or evidence of hemolysis (hemoglobin and hematocrit). Two patients had mildly elevated GGT at 48-72 hours, and one patient had two new liver foci of lymphocytic infiltrates, one of which was associated with hepatocellular degeneration.</p>
<p id="p0211" num="0211">The other observation concerned the acute phase response, i.e., inflammation. The results showed an increase in CRP/hs-CRP, % neutrophils, ferritin, IL-6, IL-8, calcitonion, fibrinogen, PT, PTT, and a decrease in iron and albumin in response to increasing dosages of rhASM. The constitutional clinical symptoms of fever, nausea, vomiting, pain, and myalgia were most likely related to the acute phase response. The results showed no evidence of cytokine release syndrome associated with cardiovascular changes, and no evidence of adrenal hormone dysfunction.</p>
<heading id="h0020"><b>6.4. <u>CONCLUSIONS</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0212" num="0212">The above-described protocol is the first experience with enzyme replacement therapy in adult human patients with ASMD. At bioactive doses in humans, rhASM did not cause cytokine release syndrome associated with cardiovascular changes, or cause adrenal hormone dysfunction. The major safety observations were dose-related hyperbilirubinemia and acute phase response. Both adverse events are likely related to the breakdown of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphylcholine, but the exact molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Several safety biomarkers were identified, including bilirubin, ceramide, CRP/hs-CRP, 1L-8, 1L-6, calcitonin, and ferritin. Further, based on the hyperbilirubinemia findings, the maximum tolerated starting dose of rhASM was 0.6 mg/kg.</p>
<p id="p0213" num="0213">Moreover, the fact that the onset of adverse events with clinical symptoms in patients was observed at a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg was surprising, given that the NOAEL ("no observed adverse effect level") in the ASMKO mouse was 0.3 mg/kg. Notably, clinical symptoms of toxicity in the ASMKO mice was not observed until doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg were used.<!-- EPO <DP n="80"> --></p>

<p id="p0214" num="0214">This example describes the investigation of the potential toxicity of repeated intravenous administration of recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM) following a debulking phase in acid sphingomyelinase knockout (ASMKO) mice. Having established that toxic side effects begin to be observed at intital doses of 10 mg/kg of rhASM in ASMKO mice, the following investigation was designed to determine if the administration of escalating doses of recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM) in ASMKO mice would debulk enough of the accumulated sphingomyelin so that a higher dose of rhASM could be administered to the ASMKO mice to target sites of pathology, such as the lung and brain, with minimal or no observable toxicity.</p>
<p id="p0215" num="0215">JK ASMKO mice were administered 3 mg/kg rhASM on study days (SD) 1, 3, 5, 7 (Debulking Phase). Beginning on SD 9 and continuing every other week for 13 weeks (7 doses) mice received treatment doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg rhASM (Treatment Phase).</p>
<p id="p0216" num="0216">rhASM was intravenously administered via a bolus injection in a lateral tail vein to male and female ASMKO mice. Groups 1-3 received 3 mg/kg rhASM during the Debulking Phase (SD 1, 3, 5 and 7). Groups 1, 2, and 3 received 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg rhASM, respectively, during the Treatment Phase (SD 9, 23, 37, 51, 65, 79, and 93). One subset of mice in each group (the first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3) were bled pre-study as well as 5 minutes and 4 hours following Treatment Phase Doses 1, 4, and 7 for analysis of toxicokinetics (TK) (5 minutes) and ceramide levels (4 hours). The other subset of mice in each group (the last 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the last 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3) were bled pre-study as well as 4 and 24 hours following Treatment Phase Doses 1, 4, and 7 for analysis of rodent multi-analyte profiles (4 hours) and acute phase protein/liver function test levels (24 hours). See the Study Design in Table 2, <i>infra.</i></p>
<p id="p0217" num="0217">Due to the likelihood of anaphylactic responses beginning with the first Treatment Phase dose and each dose thereafter, each mouse was observed closely for signs of anaphylaxis (e.g., restlessness, chewing, rubbing face, urticaria, edema, lethargy, and scruffy coat) following test article administration.

Animal body weights were taken once weekly during the course of the study beginning on SD-1 and were taken on the Monday of each week thereafter. Cageside observations were made once daily Monday through Friday. Any abnormalities and observations of normal were recorded. Post-dose clinical observations/scoring were made immediately prior to, 10-20, and 50-70 minutes following each dose administration. Any abnormalities and observations of normal were recorded. The attending veterinarian and/or the study director was consulted in the event of an adverse reaction and appropriate actions were taken based on their recommendations.</p>

<p id="p0222" num="0222">If there was an adverse reaction that affected the health and well being of an animal, then the animal was euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation, opened via the thoracic, abdominal, and cranial cavities and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for possible future analysis. If an animal was found dead, the entire carcass was preserved in 10% NBF for possible future analysis. At the end of the study all surviving animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.</p>

<p id="p0224" num="0224"><i>Blood Collection:</i> For the collection of blood for analysis of TK, rodent multi-analyte profiles, and acute phase protein/liver function test levels mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen. Blood collections occurred on SD -1, 9, 51 and 93 (pre-study and the 1st, 4th, and 7th treatment phase doses, respectively) according to the Blood Collection Tables (see Tables 4 and 5, <i>infra)</i> and the following text.
<br/>
<i>rhASM Toxicokinetics</i>: The first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3 had a blood sample taken for analysis of peak rhASM levels pre-study (SD -1), and 5 minutes following the 1st, 4th, and 7th Treatment Phase doses. Blood from all animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of unconscious mice. Approximately 60 µL of whole blood was collected into hematocrit tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 1 minute. Serum were prepared from these samples by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Following centrifugation the serum was collected and stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to maintain a temperature of ≤ -70°C. Once transferred, all samples were stored at ≤ -70°C until analysis. TK samples were transferred on SD 1, 9, 51, and 93. TK samples were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br/>
<i>Analysis of Ceramide Levels:</i> The first 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the first 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3 had a blood sample taken for analysis of ceramide levels pre-study (SD -1), and 4 hours following the 1st, 4th, and 7th Treatment Phase doses. Blood from these animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of unconscious mice. Approximately 240 µL of whole blood was collected into potassium EDTA tubes and placed on a Nutator rocker for up to 30 minutes to prevent the formation of a clot. Plasma was prepared from these samples by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 RPM. Following centrifugation the plasma was collected and stored on dry ice until transfer to a freezer set to maintain a temperature of ≤ -70°C. Once transferred, all samples were stored at ≤ -70°C until analysis by a Mass Spectrometry Group. Ceramide samples were transferred no later than SD 94. Ceramide samples were measured by mass spectrometry.<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --><br/>
<i>Analysis of Rodent Multi-Analyte Profiles (MAP)</i>: The last 2 mice/sex in Group 1 and the last 4 mice/sex in Groups 2-3 had a blood sample taken for analysis of rodent multi-analyte profiles pre-study (SD -1), and 4 hours following the 1st, 4th, and 7th Treatment Phase doses. Blood from these animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus in unconscious mice. Approximately 150 µL of whole blood was collected into serum separator tubes and allowed to clot for at least 30 minutes. Serum was prepared from these samples by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 RPM.

Patients that tolerate the 0.1 mg/kg rhASM infusion are then administered escalating doses of 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks, as tolerated. Patients who tolerate 1.0 mg/kg are then stratified by spleen volume (&lt;12 times or ≥12 times multiples of normal) and randomized to receive one of 2 target doses: 1.0 mg/kg rhASM or 3.0 mg/kg; patients randomized to the 3.0 mg/kg group will escalate to 2.0 mg/kg and then 3.0 mg/kg, as tolerated. Patients who do not tolerate the 0.1 mg/kg dose of rhASM are replaced.

Therefore the Secondary DE Phase can be completed 4 weeks after the first tolerated dose of 1.0 mg/kg. No re-challenge dose will be allowed. If the patient cannot tolerate the first dose at 2.0 mg/kg, the second rhASM dose can be decreased to the maximum tolerated dose (i.e., 1.0 mg/kg) or temporarily halted in the event of a potential dose limiting toxicity (DLT).</p>
<p id="p0265" num="0265">Patients can continue receiving rhASM at the maximum tolerated or randomized dose administered IV every 2 weeks during the 26-week DM Phase of the Primary Treatment Period. This can include both randomized and non-randomized patients.</p>
<p id="p0266" num="0266">As indicated in <figref idref="f0015">Figure 7</figref>, patients in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group can start the DM Phase at their first dose of 1.0 mg/kg following randomization, whereas patients in the 3.0 mg/kg group can start the DM Phase at their third dose of rhASM following randomization. Subsequent rhASM doses can be administered IV every 2 weeks for 26 weeks in the DM Phase for all randomized patients.</p>
<p id="p0267" num="0267">Non-randomized patients can start the DM Phase at their first dose of rhASM 2 weeks after their 16-week DE Phase. These patients can continue on their maximum tolerated dose of rhASM (&lt; 1.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for a total of 26 weeks.<!-- EPO <DP n="99"> --></p>
<p id="p0268" num="0268">If a randomized patient experiences a moderate/severe related AE (i.e., an infusion associated reaction (IAR)) during the infusion in the DM Phase, the patient may have the rhASM infusion stopped and restarted (i.e., interrupted) or the infusion rate slowed down. Provided that a potential DLT has not occurred, the patient can continue on this dose of rhASM for the remainder of the DM Phase.</p>
<p id="p0269" num="0269">After all Week 26 protocol assessments have been completed, all patients (including non-randomized patients) can enter the Long-Term Treatment period and continue rhASM treatment (at the rhASM dose that was administered during the DM Phase) IV every 2 weeks for at least 182 weeks [3.5 years] in duration or until termination of the protocol. The Long-Term Treatment Period includes the Protocol Completion (or patient withdrawal/discontinuation) visit and a safety follow-up phone call (30 to 37 days after the last dose of rhASM). Individual patient doses of rhASM may be adjusted in the Long-Term Treatment Period based on the results of the Primary Treatment Period analyses. Any required dose escalation can occur as previously described.</p>
<heading id="h0040"><b>9.3. <u>TREATMENT</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0270" num="0270">Patients will receive intravenous infusions of rhASM at 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks during the Primary DE Phase. Patients randomized to 3.0 mg/kg rhASM will receive 2.0 mg/kg prior to receiving 3.0 mg/kg (or maximum tolerated dose) 2 weeks later during the Secondary DE Phase. During the 26-week DM Phase, patients will be administered 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg (or maximum tolerated dose) rhASM every 2 weeks following the DE Phase. During the Long-Term Treatment Period, the rhASM dose that was administered during the DM Phase will be administered IV every 2 weeks.</p>
<p id="p0271" num="0271">Patients will receive each intravenous infusion of rhASM over a period of approximately 35 to 135 minutes (min) depending on the dose (see Table 9 below). Protocol treatment (rhASM) will be infused using a standard programmable infusion pump and a 0.22 micron, low protein-binding, in-line filter. To calculate the dose in mg/kg, use actual weight for patients with body mass index (BMI) ≤ 30 (weight in kg)/(height in meters); for patients with BMI &gt; 30, calculate the weight corresponding to a BMI of 30 using the patient's height.<!-- EPO <DP n="100"> -->

<p id="p0272" num="0272">Clinical end points can be measured as the percent (%) change from baseline in spleen volume multiples of normal (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging) after 26 weeks of receiving the maximum tolerated or randomized dose of rhASM. Secondary efficacy endpoints include liver volume (as measured by MRI); pulmonary imaging (by high resolution computed tomography scan and chest X ray; pulmonary function tests, including percent predicted diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, percent predicted forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and total lung capacity; exercise capacity by cycle ergometry, including percent predicted maximum workload, peak oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production; physician global assessment of change; efficacy biomarkers such as serum chitotriosidase, CCL18, and ACE; and hematology parameters such as platelet count, hemoglobin level. Efficacy assessments can also include fasting lipids, coagulation studies, disease related biomarkers, health outcome measures, and patient photographs.</p>
<p id="p0273" num="0273">Safety assessments can be performed prior to, during and/or subsequent to dose administration. Safety assessments that can be performed include: a physical examination with neurological assessment, vital signs (<i>e.g.,</i> systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation), ECG, CHO with Doppler, blood chemistry (<i>e.g.,</i> sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphate, total protein, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, etc.), hematology (<i>e.g.,</i> a complete blood count), urinalysis, biomarker analysis for biomarkers<!-- EPO <DP n="102"> --> related to cancer, hormones, cytokines (<i>e.g.,</i> IL-8 and IL-6), cardiovascular risk, acute phase reactants and other cellular processes, serum anti-rhASM IgG concentration, serum anti-rhASM IgE concentration, serum tryptase activity, and skin testing for hypersensitivity. Further, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessments can be performed prior to, during and/or subsequent to dose administration. For example, sphingomyelin levels can be assessed in the liver and skin by biopsy, and in plasma and DBS by tandem mass spectrometry.</p>
