<abstract id="abst" lang="en">
<p id="pa01" num="0001">A perforation system (100) is disclosed that utilizes an optical beamlet generator and a scanner (190), e.g., at least two moveable mirrors 150). The optical beamlet generator may be a lenslet array or a diffractive optical element. The optical beamlet generator outputs a plurality of beamlets from a single input laser beam (122). These beamlets are moved in at least two dimensions relative to a surface (22) of a substrate (20) to form perforations in the substrate (20).

<heading id="h0001">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure (invention) generally relates to the field of processing substrates and, more particularly, to creating perforations in a substrate.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Prior technology with laser/scanner perforation on aerostructures materials utilizes a combination of n lasers in conjunction with a galvo-based x-y scanner. Although control of beam direction can be realized with the x-y scanners, it comes at speeds that are much slower than are desired for use in connection with aerostructure production. In a standard two galvanometer mirror system, the mirrors are commanded to some position and the laser is made to emit light. Although flexible in terms of pointing control in two planes, and adequate for many applications, this configuration yields a relatively slow process for creating perforations for aerostructures.</p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Various perforation systems are presented herein. Both the configuration of such a perforation system and the operational characteristics of such a perforation system are within the scope of this Summary.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">According to an aspect of the present invention, a perforation system may include a laser system and a scanner. The laser system may include a laser and an optical beamlet generator. The laser system may be configured to input a laser beam (e.g., collimated) to the optical beamlet generator, which then outputs a plurality of beamlets. The scanner (e.g., at least a first movable mirror and a second movable mirror) is configured to simultaneously direct beamlets from the optical beamlet generator toward a substrate and to simultaneously move the plurality of beamlets relative to the substrate in first and second dimensions that are orthogonal to one another. Each beamlet defines a two-dimensional perforation on a surface of the substrate<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> through operation of the scanner. An optical path may be characterized as proceeding from the laser to the substrate on which perforations are formed.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The optical beamlet generator may be in the form of a lenslet array or a diffractive optical element. The laser system may include a beam expander, a beam homogenizer, or both. The beam expander may be located between the laser and the optical beamlet generator proceeding along the noted optical path. The beam homogenizer may be located between the beam expander and the optical beamlet generator proceeding along the noted optical path. The optical beamlet generator may be located between the beam homogenizer and the scanner proceeding along the noted optical path.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The perforation system may further include a movable base (e.g., rotatable), which in turn may include a plurality of optical beamlet generators. Each optical beamlet generator may be movable into alignment with the noted optical path by movement of the base. At least one of the optical beamlet generators may be detachably connectable with the base. At least two of the optical beamlet generators may be of a different configuration (e.g., to output a different number of beamlets, a different arrangement/pattern of beamlets, or both).</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Any feature of any other various aspects that is intended to be limited to a "singular" context or the like will be clearly set forth herein by terms such as "only," "single," "limited to," or the like. Merely introducing a feature in accordance with commonly accepted antecedent basis practice does not limit the corresponding feature to the singular (e.g., indicating that a perforation system includes "a lenslet array" alone does not mean that the perforation system includes only a single lenslet array). Moreover, any failure to use phrases such as "at least one" also does not limit the corresponding feature to the singular (e.g., indicating that a perforation system includes "a lenslet array" alone does not mean that the perforation system includes only a single lenslet array). Use of the phrase "at least generally" or the like in relation to a particular feature encompasses the corresponding characteristic and insubstantial variations thereof (e.g., indicating that a mirror surface is at least substantially flat encompasses the mirror surface being flat). Finally, a reference of a feature in conjunction with the phrase "in one embodiment" does not limit the use of the feature to a single embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>

These perforations may be of any desired perimeter configuration (e.g., a shape or profile of the perforation in a plan view) and/or size. <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1A</figref> illustrates a substrate 10a having such a perforation 12a in the form of a through-hole (i.e., the perforation 12a extends completely through the substrate 10a), where this perforation 12a has a perimeter 14a that defines the perimeter configuration of the perforation 12a. <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1B</figref> illustrates a substrate 10b having such a perforation 12b in the form of a recess or blind hole (i.e., the perforation 12b fails to extend completely through the substrate 10b, so the perforation 12b instead defines a concave<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> recess on a surface of the substrate 10b), where this perforation 12b has a perimeter 14b that defines the perimeter configuration of the perforation 12b. <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1C</figref> is a plan view of a perforation 12 having a circular perimeter 14, and that may be utilized for the perforation 12a of <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1A</figref> or the perforation 12b of <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">The embodiments of perforation systems disclosed herein may be configured/operated to form any appropriate number of perforations on a substrate, in any appropriate layout/arrangement, and with any appropriate spacing between adjacent pairs of perforations. Representative layouts/arrangements of perforations that may be formed by the embodiments of perforation systems disclosed herein are illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">Figures 1D and 1E</figref>. The substrate 10c of <figref idref="f0002">Figure 1D</figref> includes a plurality of circular perforations 12c that are disposed in a plurality of rows that are spaced from one another. The substrate 10d of Figure IE includes a plurality of square perforations 12d that are disposed in a plurality of rows that are spaced from one another. Any appropriate spacing between adjacent pairs of perforations in a given row may be utilized, including a common spacing between adjacent pairs of perforations throughout a given row. The same or a different spacing between adjacent pairs of perforations may be utilized in one or more rows.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">Perforations formed by any of the embodiments of perforation systems disclosed herein may provide any appropriate function or combination of functions. Representative functions for these perforations on a surface of a substrate include without limitation addressing acoustics (dampening) (the addition of perforations to a surface of a substrate may be characterized as an acoustic treatment of the substrate), addressing aerodynamic drag (e.g., improving laminar flow), surface conditioning (e.g., to enhance bonding, to enhance hydrophobic properties), cutting, trimming, welding, and the like. One application for the embodiments of perforation systems disclosed herein is to create perforations on a substrate that is used as an aerostructure (e.g., a component of an airframe for an aircraft; an exterior surface of an aerostructure).</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">A perforation system in accordance with various embodiments is illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Figure 2A</figref>, is identified by reference numeral 100, and is configured/operated to form a plurality of perforations of a predetermined perimeter configuration and size on a surface 22 of a substrate 20 in accordance with the foregoing. The perforation system 100 may be characterized as<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> including an optical system 110. Components of this optical system 110 include a laser 120, a first polygon mirror 130, and a mirror 150. The first polygon mirror 130 and mirror 150 may be characterized as a scanner 190.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The laser 120 may be of any appropriate type/configuration, of any appropriate pulse repetition rate, pulse width, power, and wavelength (e.g., YAG; 100 kHz, 10 ns, 100 W, 1064 nm), and generates a laser beam 122 that proceeds along an optical path to the substrate 20. The laser beam 122 may be output by the laser 120 in the form of a pulse that is issued at any appropriate frequency (e.g., a fixed frequency). One or more embodiments has the position of the laser 120 being fixed relative to the first polygon mirror 130 - more specifically the position of the laser 120 may be fixed relative to the position of a rotational axis 132 of the first polygon mirror 130. The impacting of the laser beam 122 on the surface 22 of the substrate 20 removes corresponding material from the substrate 20 (e.g., via ablation, vaporization, or the like of the material defining the substrate 20).</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The first polygon mirror 130 may be disposed between the laser 120 and the mirror 150 along the optical path of the laser beam 122 proceeding from the laser 120 to the substrate 20, although both the first polygon mirror 130 and the 150 mirror may be disposed at any appropriate position along the noted optical path. Operation of the perforation system 100 may include continuously rotating the first polygon mirror 130 at a constant rotational velocity about its rotational axis 132 (e.g., an appropriate rotational drive may be interconnected with the first polygon mirror 130). A plurality of faces 134 are disposed on a perimeter of the first polygon mirror 130. Any appropriate number of faces 134 may be disposed on the perimeter of the first polygon mirror 130 (six in the illustrated embodiment). Each of these faces 134 are flat or planar surfaces in one or more embodiments. Moreover, these faces 134 are each disposed at least substantially parallel to the rotational axis 132 of the first polygon mirror 130 for the case of the perforation system 100. As such, a vector 140 that is normal to its corresponding face 134 is parallel to or colinear with the same vector 140 of each other face 134 of the first polygon mirror 130 when disposed in the same rotational or angular position relative to the rotational axis 132.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">A common included angle θ exists between each adjacent pair of faces 134 of the first polygon mirror 130 (e.g., <figref idref="f0004">Figure 2B</figref>). Although adjacent faces 134 may intersect along a line,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> any appropriate transition may be used between each adjacent pair of faces 134 (e.g., a chamfer; a rounded or convex transition surface). Where the laser beam 122 impacts a given face 134 between its corresponding pair of ends 136 (the spacing between a pair of adjacent ends 136 may be referred to as defining a length dimension of the corresponding face 134) will determine where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the x dimension noted in <figref idref="f0003">Figure 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The mirror 150 may be disposed between the first polygon mirror 130 and the substrate 20 along the optical path of the laser beam 122 proceeding from the laser 120 to the substrate 20, but again the mirror 150 may be disposed at any appropriate position along the noted optical path. The position of the mirror 150 is controlled by a drive 160 (e.g., a servomotor or a galvanometer) that rotates the mirror 150 about a rotational axis 152. The mirror 150 may be referred to as a galvanometer mirror or scanner 150. In any case, the position of the mirror 150 controls where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the y dimension noted in <figref idref="f0003">Figure 2A</figref>. One or more other optical components may be located along the optical path between the mirror 150 and the substrate 20, for instance such that the laser beam 122 impacts the substrate 20 normal to its surface 22.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Operation of the perforation system 100 will be addressed with regard to <figref idref="f0003">Figures 2A</figref> and <figref idref="f0005">2C</figref>. <figref idref="f0003">Figure 2A</figref> shows a plurality of row sets 30 that extend in the x dimension and that are spaced from one another in the y dimension (e.g., the plurality of row sets 30 may be disposed in parallel relation to one another). Each row set 30 may be characterized as including a plurality of rows 32 that also extend in the x dimension and that are spaced from one another in the y dimension (e.g., the plurality of rows 32 may be disposed in parallel relation to one another). Generally and as shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref>, the laser 120 may be activated such that its laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 at each of the locations shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref> to define a plurality of perforations 12 in each row set 30, where each of these perforations 12 will ultimately have a predetermined perimeter configuration, and where the perforations 12 in each row set 30 are spaced from one another in any appropriate fashion (e.g., an equally spaced relation within the given row set 30).<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Generally, the mirror 150 may be moved to a fixed position where the laser beam 122 will impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 along one of the rows 32 (or between an adjacent pair of rows 32) of a particular row set 30. The laser 120 will be pulsed such that it impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 at predetermined locations along the given row 32 (or in the x dimension) to define a corresponding portion of each of the perforations 12, and that is achieved by the laser beam 122 being reflected from a face 134 of the first polygon mirror 130 as it is being rotated at a constant rotational speed about its rotational axis 132. Again, the location of where the laser beam 122 impacts a face 134 of the first polygon mirror 130 (e.g., where the laser beam 122 impacts a face 134 along its length dimension), determines where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the x dimension. The mirror 150 may be incremented between a number of different fixed positions such that the laser beam 122 will impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 along each of the rows 32 (or between each of the rows 32) of a particular row set 30 to define each of the desired perforations 12 in this row set 30 and where each perforation 12 will ultimately have a predetermined perimeter configuration.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">One way in which the perforations 12 shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref> may be produced will be summarized. The mirror 150 may be positioned such that the laser beam 122 will impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 on the second row 32 (the second down from the top in the view of <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref>) of the upper row set 30 in the view of <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref>. With the mirror 150 remaining in this fixed position, the laser 120 may be pulsed and reflected by one or more faces 134 of the rotating first polygon mirror 130 to impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 at the locations shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref> (these locations being spaced from one another in the x dimension but occupying the same position in the y dimension). This may be repeated a plurality of times in order for each of the perforations 12 to extend to the desired depth within the substrate 20 (including for a given perforation 12 to extend through the entire thickness of the substrate 20). Thereafter, the mirror 150 may be incremented/moved to a position where the laser beam 122 will impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 on the next row 32 proceeding in the y dimension (e.g., to another location in the y dimension). With the mirror 150 remaining in this new fixed position, again the laser 120 may be pulsed and reflected by one or more faces 134 of the rotating first polygon mirror 130 to impact the surface 22 of the substrate 20 at the locations shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref> (these locations being spaced from one another in the x dimension but occupying the same position in the y dimension). This may be repeated until each of the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> perforations 12 in the row set 30 have been defined, and also may be repeated for each row set 30 in which one or more perforations 12 are to be defined.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Based upon the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the mirror 150 is moved in increments dy to form the desired perforations 12 in a particular row set 30, and is moved in a larger increment Dy to move from one row set 30 to an adjacent row set 30. Although the perforation system 100 may be operated to scan or sequence in a top-to-down fashion in the view shown in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 2C</figref>, and where the entire depth of each perforation in a given row 32 may be defined prior to proceeding to the next row 32 in the same row set 30 (or more generally to another location in the y dimension), other operational configurations may be utilized. For instance, perforations 12 may be partially defined in each row 32 of a given row set 30, although this would require more incremental movements of the mirror 150 (e.g., ½ of the desired perforation depth for each perforation 12 in a given row set 30 may be defined by a first set of incremental movements of the mirror 150, and this may then be repeated to define the remainder of the desired perforation depth for each perforation in this same row set 30), and this may apply to each row set 30.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">A perforation system in accordance with various embodiments is illustrated in <figref idref="f0006">Figure 3A</figref>, is identified by reference numeral 200, and is configured/operated to form a plurality of perforations of a predetermined perimeter configuration and size on a surface 22 of a substrate 20 in accordance with the foregoing. Corresponding components between the perforation system 100 of <figref idref="f0003">Figure 2A</figref> and the perforation system 200 of <figref idref="f0006">Figure 3A</figref> are identified by the same reference numeral and the corresponding discussion above remains applicable to the perforation system 200 unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">The perforation system 200 may be characterized as including an optical system 210. Components of this optical system 210 include the laser 120, a first polygon mirror 130a, and the mirror 150. The first polygon mirror 130a and mirror 150 may be characterized as a scanner 290. The first polygon mirror 130a is disposed between the laser 120 and the mirror 150 along the optical path of the laser beam 122 proceeding from the laser 120 to the substrate 20, although both the first polygon mirror 130a and the mirror 150 may be disposed at any appropriate position along the noted optical path. Operation of the perforation system 200 may include<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> continuously rotating the first polygon mirror 130a at a constant rotational velocity about its rotational axis 132. A plurality of faces 134a are disposed on a perimeter of the first polygon mirror 130a. Any appropriate number of faces 134a may be disposed on the perimeter of the first polygon mirror 130a (six in the illustrated embodiment). Each of these faces 134a are flat or planar surfaces in one or more embodiments. Unlike the case of the perforation system 100 discussed above, these faces 134a are each disposed in a different orientation relative to the rotational axis 132 of the first polygon mirror 130a and as shown in <figref idref="f0007">Figure 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idref="f0008">Figure 3C</figref> shows the orientation of the rotational axis 132 of the first polygon mirror 130a, along with a reference plane 138 that corresponds with one of the faces 134a. As such, a vector 140a that is orthogonal to this face 134a is disposed in an orientation other than perpendicular to the rotational axis 132 of the first polygon mirror 130a. Stated another way, there is an included angle Φ between the rotational axis 132 and the reference plane 138, and this included angle Φ may be any appropriate value that is greater than 0°. Based upon the different orientation of each face 134a of the first polygon mirror 130a, the vector 140a will be in a different orientation for each of the faces 134a of the first polygon mirror 130a when in the same rotational or angular position relative to the rotational axis 132 (see <figref idref="f0007">Figure 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">Although adjacent faces 134a of the first polygon mirror 130a may intersect along a line, any appropriate transition may be used between each adjacent pair of faces 134a (e.g., a chamfer; a rounded or convex transition surface). Again, where the laser beam 122 impacts a given face 134a between its corresponding pair of ends 136 (or along the length dimension of such a face 134a) will determine where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the x dimension noted in <figref idref="f0006">Figure 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">The position of the mirror 150 again is controlled by the drive 160. Generally, the position of the mirror 150 at least partially controls where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the y dimension noted in <figref idref="f0006">Figure 3A</figref>. However, the different orientations of the faces 134a of the first polygon mirror 130 also controls where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the y dimension noted in <figref idref="f0006">Figure 3A</figref>. One or more other optical components may be located along the optical path between the mirror 150 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> substrate 20, for instance such that the laser beam 122 impacts the substrate 20 normal to its surface 22.</p>

That is, each face 134a of the first polygon mirror 130a is associated with a different location in the y dimension shown in <figref idref="f0009">Figure 3D</figref>.

Again, the location of where the laser beam 122 impacts a face 134 of the first polygon mirror 130 (e.g., where the laser beam 122 impacts a face 134 along its length dimension), determines where the laser beam 122 impacts the surface 22 of the substrate 20 in the x dimension (and in the corresponding row or between the corresponding pair of adjacent rows of the current row set 30).

For instance, perforations 12 may be partially defined in each of the row sets 30, although this would require more incremental movements of the mirror 150 (e.g., ½ of the desired perforation depth for each perforation 12 in each row set 30 may be defined by a first set of incremental movements of the mirror 150, and this may then be repeated to define the remainder of the desired perforation depth for each perforation in each row set 30 by repeating the noted incremental movements of the mirror 150).
