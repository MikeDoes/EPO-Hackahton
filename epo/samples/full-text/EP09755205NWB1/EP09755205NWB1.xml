<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">A device according to the present invention is generally directed to visual rehabilitation and treatment of pain for patients with epithelial defects on the cornea of the eye. Although specific reference is made to epithelial defects following photorefractive keratectomy, embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat epithelial defects from other causes, for example corneal abrasions, trauma, keratoconus, penetrating keratoplasty and dystrophies.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The eye includes several tissues that allow patients to see. The cornea of the eye is an anterior tissue of the eye that is clear in healthy eyes and refracts light so as to form an image on the retina. The retina is a posterior tissue of the eye that senses light from the image formed thereon and transmits signals from the image to the brain. The cornea includes an outer layer of tissue, the epithelium, which protects the underlying tissues of the cornea, such as Bowman's membrane, the stroma and nerve fibers that extend into the stroma and Bowman's. The healthy eye includes a tear film disposed over the epithelium. The tear film can smooth small irregularities of the epithelium so as to provide an optically smooth surface. The tear film is shaped substantially by the shape of the underlying epithelium, stroma, and Bowman's membrane, if present. The tear film comprises a liquid that is mostly water and does include additional components, such as mucoids and lipids. The many nerve fibers of the cornea provide sensation to promote blinking that can cover the cornea with the tear film. The never fibers also sense pain so that one will normally avoid trauma to the cornea and also avoid direct contact of an object to the cornea so as to protect this important tissue.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In the healthy cornea, the proper amount of hydration of the cornea, sometimes referred to as dehydration of the cornea, is maintained such that the cornea remains clear. The cornea includes a posterior endothelial layer that pumps water from the cornea into the adjacent anterior chamber. The epithelium minimizes flow of water from the tear liquid into the cornea, such that the corneal stroma can be maintained with the proper amount of hydration with endothelial pumping. The endothelial pumping of water from the cornea to maintain the proper hydration and thickness of the eye is often referred to as deturgescence.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">In patients with epithelial defects, the barrier function of the epithelium is compromised, such that water can enter the cornea through the epithelial defect so as to cause swelling of the corneal stroma. As a result, excessive hydration of the cornea may<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> occur in eyes with epithelial defects. In some instances, excessive hydration that swells the corneal stroma can result in light scattering, or haze, such that an image seen by a patient is degraded. The scattering of light by the corneal stroma can be seen with a slit lamp examination to diagnose the patient, and is sometimes referred to as corneal haze. In addition to potentially causing excess hydration of the cornea, an epithelial defect can expose the nerve fibers of the cornea such that the patient feels pain.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Several known techniques exist to treat corneal epithelial defects, including bandage therapeutic lenses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (hereinafter NSAIDS), steroids, antibiotics and analgesics. These known techniques may be somewhat effective in reducing symptoms associated with the epithelial defect. However, many of these known techniques may not provide a barrier to water entry into the corneal stroma, such that the cornea may swell with water and may affect patient vision in at least some instances. For example, a bandage therapeutic lens may be placed over the epithelial defect to cover and protect the corneal tissues under the defect, such as the corneal stroma and nerve fibers. However, in at least some instances the bandage therapeutic lens may not prevent water of the tear from leaking through the epithelial defect into the stroma. Also, a bandage therapeutic lens may slide over the epithelial defect when positioned on the eye in at least some instances, potentially decreasing the therapeutic benefit of the therapeutic lens when the lens slides along the delicate underlying tissue, for example when a patient blinks.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that at least some of the known therapeutic bandage lenses used to treat epithelial defects may actually contribute to corneal edema and pain in at least some instances. At least some of the current bandage lenses may provide less oxygen than would be ideal, and decreased oxygen to the cornea may be related pain and corneal edema in at least some instances. Also, in at least some instances, bandage lenses may be fit loosely on the cornea, such that water can go around the bandage lens and may penetrate the stroma through the epithelial defect.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Although analgesics such as lidocaine may reduce pain, the overuse of these treatments can delay regeneration of the epithelial tissue over the defect, such that the defect may last longer. Consequently many people with epithelial defects may feel pain and have degraded vision while the epithelial defect heals.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Many people elect to undergo laser vision correction surgery to treat refractive error of the eye, such as near sightedness. With one form of this surgery known as photorefractive<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> keratectomy (hereinafter "PRK"), a large area of the epithelium is removed, for example a 6 mm area. Following ablation of the underlying tissues such as the corneal stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, the epithelium grows back over the ablation to cover the area where the epithelium was removed. This re-growth of the epithelium can take three to four days, and at least some of the patients who undergo this surgery may feel pain. In addition, the epithelium may be somewhat irregular while growing back over the corneal stroma, and the irregularities may degrade patient vision in at least some instances. Further, work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that anterior stromal edema, ablated surface irregularities and necrotic cells in the ablated surface area may decrease vision in some instances. Therefore, improved treatment of epithelial defects may result in improved patient comfort and vision following PRK, and possibly other surgeries that remove the corneal epithelium.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In light of the above, it would be desirable to provide improved treatments for epithelial defects of the cornea. Ideally, these treatments would avoid at least some of the deficiencies of known techniques while providing improved patient comfort and/or vision while the epithelial defect heals.</p>

<heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The scope of the invention is set out in the appended claims. The present invention is generally directed to visual rehabilitation and treatment of pain for patients with epithelial defects on the cornea of the eye. Although specific reference<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is made to epithelial defects following photorefractive keratectomy, embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat epithelial defects from other causes, for example corneal abrasions, trauma, keratoconus and corneal dystrophies. Embodiments of the present invention can provide patients having epithelial defects with improved hydration of the cornea and improved vision with decreased pain.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention provide a therapeutic covering for the treatment of an epithelial defect of a cornea of an eye. The cornea comprises a stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The covering may comprise a layer of a therapeutic material positionable over the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane of the eye. The layer can be positionable over the eye to reduce pain, for functional vision through the layer, to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea, and/or so as to decrease light scatter of the cornea. The layer can be configured to reduce pain in many ways, for example by covering exposed nerve fibers and/or by adhering to the stroma and/or Bowman's so as to inhibit, in some embodiments minimize, rubbing of the layer on the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane where nerve fibers may be located. The layer may be configured for positioning on the eye with mechanical resistance sufficient to resist a blink of the eyelid, and this resistance may decrease pain by inhibiting motion of the covering over corneal nerve fibers. The layer can be configured for functional vision through the layer in many ways, for example configured to contact the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane for a plurality of days so as to inhibit and/or minimize, swelling of the cornea and/or so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the cornea. The layer may comprise an index of refraction so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer can be configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea in many ways, for example with a hyperosmotic solution, a hydrophobic liquid and/or a matrix material that inhibits and/or minimizes water flow from the tear liquid to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer may be configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea for a plurality of days when positioned on the eye, and the layer may restore deturgescence of the cornea. In some embodiments, the layer is configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from the stroma and /or Bowman's membrane. The layer may comprise an index of refraction to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer may be configured for the eye to view through for a plurality of days when positioned on the eye. The layer can be configured to adhere to the stroma and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Bowman's membrane. The layer may comprise a curved anterior surface that corresponds to the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane to within about+/- ID, for example with post-PRK patients, such that the lens with the curved anterior surface comprises a lens to correct vision of the patient when the epithelium regenerates. The layer of therapeutic material can be positioned on the eye in many ways, for example with a covering that is placed on the eye or with a spray that is cured to adhere the layer to the exposed surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. For example, a thin layer may be sprayed on the corneal surface which comprises a curved anterior surface of the therapeutic layer that corrects patient vision. In some embodiments, a therapeutic lens disposed over the layer of therapeutic material may comprise a curved anterior surface that corrects patient vision.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The therapeutic covering may comprise oxygen permeability sufficient to restore deturgescence of the cornea, for example with an oxygen permeability Dk parameter of 350 or more, such that the epithelial and endothelial cell layers have oxygen for epithelial regeneration and endothelial pumping to restore deturgescence, respectively. The covering may comprise a hydrophobic water barrier layer disposed between a hydrophilic lower surface to contact the cornea and a hydrophilic upper surface to contact the tear film. An outer portion of the covering may be configured to form a seal with the epithelium such that the covering can be adhered to the cornea with endothelial suction of the covering onto the epithelial defect. As the endothelial suction may not immediately adhere the covering to the cornea, the covering may be held in place with another mechanism initially. For example, a contact lens may be placed over the covering to hold the covering against the epithelial defect, and the contact lens removed after the covering is adhered to the cornea with endothelial suction, for example removed after one hour or less.</p>

<p id="p0312" num="0312">In examples described herein, the covering comprises an inner portion and an outer portion, in which the outer portion conforms to the cornea to seal the cornea, and the inner portion comprising a lens. The lens may comprise a shape, and the outer portion may be more rigid than the inner portion such that the shape of the lens is substantially retained when the epithelium regenerates to close the defect and the cornea is sealed.</p>
<p id="p0313" num="0313">In examples described herein, the epithelial defect comprises an area of corneal tissue, and the covering is removed when the epithelial defect is healed with an epithelial layer over the area of corneal tissue. The covering can be separated from the epithelial layer when the covering is removed such that the epithelial layer remains over the area.</p>
<p id="p0314" num="0314">In examples described herein, a contact lens is placed over the covering to adhere the covering to the cornea. The contact lens can be removed from the covering when the covering is adhered to the cornea. For example, the contact lens is removed from the covering no more than about one hour after the contact lens is positioned on the covering.</p>
<p id="p0315" num="0315">Examples described herein provide a method of treating an eye having a cornea with an epithelial defect. A therapeutic covering is placed on the cornea, and the therapeutic covering corrects optical aberrations of the eye when the covering is adhered to the cornea.</p>

<heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0318" num="0318">Embodiments of the present invention provide a therapeutic cover for the treatment of an epithelial defect. The cover may comprise a layer of therapeutic material positionable over the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A person or ordinary skill in the art may refer to Bowman's membrane as "Bowman's". The cover may minimize water flow into the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, such that corneal deturgescence can be restored and can decrease light scattering when the epithelium regenerates. The layer of therapeutic material can cover and protect nerve fibers so as to decrease pain felt by the patient. The layer may comprise an index of refraction to inhibit or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with an index of refraction that matches the index of refraction of the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The cover may comprise a curved anterior surface that corresponds to the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with post-PRK patients, such that the curved anterior surface comprises a lens to correct vision of the patient when the epithelium regenerates. The lens on the anterior surface of the layer may correspond to the optical power of the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's to within about +/- 1 Diopter. The layer of therapeutic filler material may comprise a solid, an adhesive, a gel, a low adhesion gel, and/or a liquid with therapeutic properties. The layer of therapeutic material can be positioned on the eye in many ways, for example with a spray that is cured to adhere the layer to the exposed surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A thin layer sprayed on the corneal surface may comprise the curved anterior surface of the therapeutic lens that corrects patient vision. A therapeutic lens disposed over the layer of therapeutic material may comprise the curved anterior surface of the therapeutic lens that corrects patient vision, and the therapeutic lens may comprise a posterior surface with a curvature that fits the curvature of the epithelium.</p>
<p id="p0319" num="0319">The therapeutic covering as described herein can be used with many corneal surgeries. For example, the therapeutic covering can be used with surgery of the cornea where an incision is made, and the covering used to shape the cornea when the corneaheals, for example with penetrating keratoplasty, also referred to as PKP.</p>
<p id="p0320" num="0320">As used herein, a lens encompasses at least one light transmitting body with two opposite surfaces with optical properties suitable for forming images. A therapeutic contact lens encompasses a lens that can be worn on the cornea of the eye. The lens may comprise little or no refractive power when placed on the cornea.<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --></p>
<p id="p0321" num="0321">As used herein the stroma and/or (the) Bowman's encompasses: the Bowman's membrane or the stroma, or both. For example, the ablations and coverings described herein can be used to cover one of Bowman's membrane or the stroma following laser ablation, or both. With PRK, for example, both the stroma and Bowman's can be ablated, such that the ablated surface includes an exposed surface of Bowman's membrane and an exposed stromal surface such that the covering contacts both the stroma and Bowman's membrane. In some instances, Bowman's membrane may be ablated such that the coverings described herein may cover mostly stromal tissue, for example with a deep PRK ablation of about 150 um. With a very shallow PRK ablation, for example to about five microns, the ablated surface in a human cornea may comprise Bowman's membrane without exposed stromal tissue.</p>
<p id="p0322" num="0322">A tie layer encompasses a layer that can be optically clear, and adhere the lens, itself or other "layer" to the cornea, for example to at least one of the stroma, the epithelium or the conjunctiva.</p>
<p id="p0323" num="0323">Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that edema can be caused by both a decreased water barrier function and decreased oxygenation of the cornea. The thin lens covering can provide pain management both mechanically and metabolically. From a mechanical standpoint, the thin lens covering can provide a barrier against rubbing between the debrided zone and the inside of the eye lid. The thin lens covering may also comprise a barrier sealed against the epithelium so as to inhibit or minimize water entering the debrided area. From a metabolic standpoint, the thin lens covering comprises oxygen permeability so as to provide the amounts of oxygenation helpful for corneal epithelium healing. The oxygenation can also be sufficient for increased endothelial pumping and associated metabolism that may occur in response to the epithelial defect. For epithelial re-growth of the debrided epithelium, the oxygen requirement of the epithelium growing over the defect can be much higher than for intact epithelium. Without adequate oxygenation, the epithelium may shift the metabolic pathway away from producing the carbon dioxide to producing lactic acid. The lactic acid can cause hyperosmosis in the epithelial and stromal layers and draw water into these layers which, in turn, may cause the cornea to swell. The decreased oxygen of the cornea may also cause nerve activation manifested by pain, for example nerve activation due to increase swelling. Examples of the present disclosure can provide a therapeutic covering with a high oxygen permeability, for example a Dk of at least about 350. The Dk of the covering may comprise a value of 400 or more, for example a Dk of at least about 500.<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> This increased permeability can decrease swelling associated with the metabolically active epithelium when the epithelium regenerates over the debrided cornea.</p>
<p id="p0324" num="0324">The therapeutic material and/or layer as described herein may comprise permeability to water no more than about 50 % more than a healthy cornea, or about 1.5 times the permeability of the cornea, for example about no more than 25% more than a healthy cornea, or 1.25 times the permeability of the healthy cornea, such as the cornea prior to ablation. The permeability of the cornea, for example the permeability of the corneal epithelium, can be expressed as a quantity of water per unit area of the cornea per unit time. The permeability of the cornea to water may comprise the permeability of the corneal epithelium to water.</p>
<p id="p0325" num="0325">The therapeutic device may be used as a drug delivery platform. At least one of the therapeutic materials or the therapeutic lens may comprise a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent may comprise at least one of an analgesic, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, a steroid or an epithelial growth factor to enhance epithelialization.

The growth factor may comprise at least one of fibroblast growth factor, fibronectin, or arginine glycine aspartic acid (RGD) comprising peptide sequence or a derivative thereof.</p>
<p id="p0326" num="0326">An analgesic therapeutic agent may comprise an anesthetic therapeutic agent configured for delivery to the cornea at an amount so as to have an analgesic effect and reduce pain, for example without numbing the cornea.<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --></p>

<p id="p0328" num="0328"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> shows a cornea 10 of an eye with an epithelial defect 11 following refractive surgery, for example PRK, suitable for incorporation of embodiments of the present invention. Cornea 10 includes an epithelium 12 disposed over a stroma 16. A tear liquid 13 covers the anterior surface of epithelium 12. In at least humans, primates and some birds, a Bowman's membrane 14 is disposed between epithelium 12 and stroma 16. Bowman's membrane 14 comprises an acellular collagenous tissue with a thickness of about 5 to 10 microns. In some animals, Bowman's membrane may be absent and the epithelium may be disposed adjacent to the stromal layer. An endothelium 18 is disposed under stroma 16. Endothelium 18 comprises a layer of cells that pump water from cornea 10 as indicated by arrows 19. Tear liquid 13 also covers surfaces of the cornea that are exposed by the epithelial defect, such as an exposed surface of Bowman's membrane I4E and an exposed stromal surface 16E.</p>
<p id="p0329" num="0329">In a normal healthy eye, epithelium 12 is disposed across cornea 10 and is a protective layer. Epithelium 12 covers nerves of the cornea and minimizes the flow of water from the tear film of the eye to into the stroma. Epithelium 12 in most human patients can be about 40 to 60 microns thick, for example about 50 microns. When epithelium 12 is intact, endothelium 18 can pump water from stroma 16 and maintain hydration in the cornea at a proper level. The mechanism by which the stroma of the cornea remains properly hydrated can be referred to as deturgescence. Deturgescence of the cornea can be important because excess hydration of the cornea can result in swelling of the cornea and light scattering, or haze, that can degrade vision. The total thickness of normal cornea 10 from endothelium 18 to tear liquid 13 in most human patients can be from about 400 to 600 microns. A healthy cornea with normal hydration comprises about 80 to 85% water. Edema of the<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> cornea due to swelling of the cornea, for example with additional water can increase, the thickness of the cornea.</p>
<p id="p0330" num="0330">With refractive surgery, for example PRK, the epithelium can be removed to ablate a refractive correction into Bowman's membrane 14 and/or stroma 16. An initial profile 22 of the anterior surface of stroma and/or Bowman's membrane is ablated to an ablated profile 20 to correct the patient's vision. The profile of tissue removed to correct vision is described in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5163934A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,934</text></patcit>, entitled "Photorefractive keratectomy", the disclosure of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some examples of the present disclosure. Ablated profile 20 generally comprises an optical zone that extends across the cornea to correct refractive error of the eye and may correct aberrations of the eye, for example wavefront aberrations. Ablated profile 20 is bounded by boundary 2OB that may circumscribe the ablated profile. The epithelium grows centripetally from circumscribing boundary 12B toward the center of ablated profile 20 to cover the exposed stroma, as indicated by arrows 30.</p>

Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 130 can be formed in many ways, for example by application of a drop of liquid that spreads on the eye, for example with surface tension and/or a therapeutic lens mold. Filler material 130 may comprise a two component system with a polymer component and a cross-linker component. The two components may be applied separately, for example by separate application, or simultaneously, for example with a mixed aerosol spray. Filler material 130 can be applied over ablated profile 20. Filler material 130 can be applied over epithelium 20 with a peripheral flap 120 that can facilitate removal of filler material 130 when epithelium 12 regenerates centripetally as shown by arrows 30, as shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0332" num="0332">The therapeutic filler material can be applied in many ways. The therapeutic filler material can be applied as a spray onto the cornea post PRK, with a layer thin enough to match PRK contour and thick enough to smooth roughness of the post ablation contour at the interface of the filler material and stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The filler material can be applied with an inkjet deposition process, for example with separate cartridges for each component of two component system. Microparticles of the filler material can be applied, for example microparticles of collagen.<!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --> The filler material can build up over time with deposition to make the therapeutic layer and/or lens.

Lens 150 comprises an optical surface 152 that is smooth to improve patient vision. Tie layer 140 comprises a lower surface 142, or posterior surface, that is adhered to the stroma and/or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 140 allows tie layer 140 to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier.</p>
<p id="p0334" num="0334"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref> shows optical smoothing of a corneal surface and barrier protection with therapeutic lens 150 comprising optical surface 152. Filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 comprise a thickness 132. Thickness 132 can be sufficient to inhibit or minimize passive transport of water, for example by diffusion, from the tear film near the anterior surface through filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 to ablated profile 20 as indicated by arrow 158. Optical surface 152 corresponds to abated surface 20 over an optically useful portion of ablated surface 20, for example at least about a central 3 mm of ablated surface 20.</p>
<p id="p0335" num="0335">The permeability to water of filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 may be no more than about 50% more than the pumping capacity of the endothelial layer.

Irregularities 201 can include peaks<!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --> 2OP and valleys 20V. Such irregularities may be caused by the ablation of tissue and may be present prior to ablation for example with naturally occurring roughness of Bowman's membrane and/or roughness of an exposed surface of the cornea following debridement of the corneal epithelium.</p>

Thickness 132 can be substantially uniform such that the profile of anterior optical surface 152 corresponds to ablated profile 20 and smooths irregularities 201. For example, thickness 132 can be within a range from about 1 micron to about 200 microns, as noted above, and thickness 132 can vary from a mean value by no more than about +/- 10 microns over an optically useful portion of the layer, such that the anterior surface of therapeutic layer 130 and/or tie layer 140 corresponds to ablated profile 20.

<p id="p0354" num="0354">The optical clarity of the fibrin adhesive may be modulated by altering the fibrin structure (solid phase) within the fibrin gel, for example when the adhesive is sprayed onto the eye to form a layer with a thickness from about 5 to 100 microns. This may be accomplished by altering the gelation time (thrombin concentration between 1-1000 units/mL) or by altering the ionic strength of the liquid phase of the gel. A more opaque ("coarse") gel is created by lower ionic strength and slower gelation times (low thrombin concentration). A clear or "fine" gel can be made by increasing the ionic strength or decreasing the gelation time (almost instantaneous at a high thrombin concentration, while several minutes at a low thrombin concentration). As gelation time usually is preferably consistent for a given medical application, it may be more convenient to alter the ionic strength of the liquid phase by increasing or decreasing the salt concentration (as an example, if using sodium chloride, the concentrations range between 0-500 mM). For example, lyophilized thrombin may be reconstituted in a low ionic strength buffer with the requisite calcium chloride (required for covalent crosslinking of the resultant gel by the transamidation reaction of Factor XIII) in order to create a more opaque gel. To create an optically clear gel, a higher salt concentration buffer system (e.g., saline at twice or more physiological concentration) with calcium chloride can be used. Other ways of altering the ionic strength can be by use of compatible salts and buffers such as potassium chloride, calcium chloride, tris buffer, carbonate buffer, and the like. Alternately or in combination, sugar-based solutions can be used such as dextrose. Dextran solutions can also be used to alter the ionic strength. The buffer/salt solution can be used in either the fibrinogen component or the thrombin component, though it is most convenient to reconstitute and dilute the thrombin component in order to attain the desired gel time. The above can be used to spray an optically clear and optically transmissive layer on the eye such that a patient has functional vision of 20/40 or better, for example 20/25 or better.</p>

<p id="p0364" num="0364">Table 1 is merely an example of some of the electromagnetic radiation wavelength that may be used to achieve photo-activation, which may generally have a wavelength from about 10 nm to about 700 nm and will be within the visual, infrared or ultra violet spectra. The radiation may be supplied in the form of a monochromatic laser beam or other form of electromagnetic radiation source. The choice of energy source can be made in conjunction with the choice of photosensitizer employed in the composition. For example, an argon laser may be particularly suitable for use with flavins such as riboflavin-5-phosphate, i.e., flavins are optimally excited at wavelengths corresponding to the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the argon laser. For similar reasons, a diode laser can be suitable for use with chlorophylls such as bacteriochlorophyll A.</p>
<p id="p0365" num="0365">There are at least two major types of sensitized photo- oxidative processes, for example Type I and Type II. The sensitizer in its ground state can first absorb light energy to form S<sub>x</sub> and T which may comprise sensitizer molecules in their excited singlet and triplet states, respectively. Both Type I and Type II reactions can then proceed via the triplet state because it has a much longer lifetime than the singlet state.</p>
<p id="p0366" num="0366">In many Type I reactions, the sensitizer triplet T<sup>∧</sup> can then directly bind to the substrate to produce substrate free radicals or radical anions. The substrate radicals then can undergo further reactions, including that with molecular oxygen to form the superoxide anion O<sub>2-</sub>. The superoxide<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> anion then can react in numerous ways. For example, the superoxide anion can further react to generate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and the hydroxyl radical (OH*).</p>
<p id="p0367" num="0367">In Type II reactions, the sensitizer triplet may react first with molecular oxygen to produce singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). The singlet oxygen can then oxidize the substrate to form photo-oxidation products. Direct electron transfer from triplet to oxygen can also occur to yield superoxide anions, but in some instances much less efficiently.</p>
<p id="p0368" num="0368">Photo sensitizers can then cause oxidative damage to susceptible amino acid residues, for example histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine, and methionine. They may cause non-disulfide covalent cross-links in susceptible proteins. This process can be oxygen dependent and may be mediated by singlet oxygen rather than by superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, or hydroxyl radicals. Natural collagen can be devoid of disulfide bridges. Examples described herein may enable one to produce non-disulfide covalent cross links within collagen when exposed to light so to adhere an onlay to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane.</p>
<p id="p0369" num="0369">Water soluble photosensitizers that have high quantum efficiency for singlet oxygen production can be selected. These photosensitizers may include rose bengal (excited by the argon laser), riboflavin-5-phosphate (argon laser), porphyrins (argon/krypton) and methylene blue (krypton laser). The photosensitizer can then be mixed with a protein solder, applied to the wound, and exposed to the appropriate laser. An 18% fibrinogen solution may have the right consistency for ease of application and dissolved all photosensitizers without problem. Welded fibrinogen may resorb in vivo (Oz and Chuck et al., 1989), and may be a good substrate for an organic glue where resorbtion is used such that the onlay is temporarily adhered with the adhesive, for example prior to integration and/or re-epithelialization. Other proteins that may be used include albumin, collagen, myoglobin, glutathione, acid soluble collagen, /3<sub>H</sub> crystalline β crystalline and lysine, at various concentrations and in combinations with each other and with various photosensitizers and salts. For a more complete list of formulations, see Table 2, which shows protein and photosensitizer combinations that may be used.

<p id="p0370" num="0370">Table 2 shows examples of photosensitizers that may be used and empirical experiments can be performed on a suitable number of animals and/or patients to determine appropriate characteristics to adhere and/or cure the onlay on the exposed surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The photosensitizers of Table 2 can be combined with many of the onlay materials described and/or adhesives described herein to form a material suitable for adhesion to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane.</p>
<p id="p0371" num="0371">Adhesion of a therapeutic layer can be used to hold the therapeutic layer in place while an adhesive sets. A photosensitizer may be disposed under the therapeutic layer and tack welded with laser and/or other light to weld the therapeutic layer to the tissue. An additional adhesive may be employed, for example delivered with a deliver tool near the periphery of the therapeutic layer. The tack welds can hold the therapeutic layer in place while the adhesive sets. An annular track of adhesive may be disposed on the therapeutic layer as described above, and used with tack welding of the therapeutic layer with light.</p>
<heading id="h0010">PROTEIN CROSS-LINKING AGENTS</heading>
<p id="p0372" num="0372">Many protein cross-linking agents may be used, for example adhesives as described above. A heterobifunctional with a photoactivated group and a cross-linking group can be employed so as to cross-link the layer to the Bowman's membrane and/or stroma with covalent bonds in response to<!-- EPO <DP n="77"> --> photo activation with an appropriate flux. The cross-linking agent may crosslink the therapeutic layer to Bowman's membrane and/or the stroma without photoactivation.</p>
<p id="p0373" num="0373"><figref idref="f0002">Fig. 1C2</figref> shows regeneration of the epithelial layer with centripetal advancement of the epithelial layer under therapeutic lens 150. Regenerated epithelium 112 comprises a leading edge 112A that advances centripetally as shown by arrows 30. Filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 comprise peripheral flap 120 that allows the epithelium to advance centripetally under and dislodge a peripheral portion of the filler material and/or tie layer while a central portion of the filler material and/or tie layer remains adhered to the cornea. This adherence of a central portion of the filler material and/or tie layer while the peripheral portion is dislodged allows the filler material and/or tie layer to inhibit or minimize water transport into the cornea and provide good vision through the adhered portion. The epithelium continues to regenerate centripetally and dislodge filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 with leading edge 1 12A near the center of ablated profile 20. When the epithelium substantially covers the cornea so as to provide a natural barrier to water and natural smoothing of most of ablated profile 20, therapeutic lens 150 can be completely dislodged from the cornea, for example when the epithelial defect is no more than about I mm across.</p>

Aperture 210A can be shaped so as to apply filler material 230 to the eye over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman's membrane. A layer 230L of filler material forms over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman s membrane. Filler material 230 can be applied to the eye in many ways, for example as described above, and with aperture 210A disposed between the cornea and source of aerosol, for example with an aerosol spray 220 comprising small particles directed toward the anterior exposed surface of cornea 10. Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 230 can be formed in many ways as described above. Filler material 230 may comprise a two component system, as described above. Filler material 230 can be applied over ablated profile 20 so as to inhibit or minimize deposition of the filler material on the epithelium, as this may allow the epithelium 12 to regenerate over the cured filler material.</p>

Lens 250 comprises an optical surface 252 that is smooth to improve patient vision as described above. Optical surface 252 corresponds to ablated surface 20 over an optically useful portion of ablated surface 20, for example<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --> at least about a central 3 mm of ablated surface 20. Tie layer 240 comprises a lower surface 242, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 244, or anterior surface. Lower surface 242 is adhered to the stroma and or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 240 allows tie layer 240 to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier and therapeutic optical surface.</p>

As the irregularities of the cornea can be small, a thickness of about 1 um can provide optical smoothing and provide a barrier. Thickness 232 can be within a range from about 3 microns to about 25 microns, for example from about 4 microns to about 10 microns, and provide a therapeutic barrier and therapeutic optical surface.

A layer 280L of filler material 280, similar to layer 130L, layer 230L, filler material 130 and filler material 230, can be applied to the cornea and cured to form a tie layer 290, similar to tie layer 140 and tie layer 240 as described above. Tie layer 290 comprises a lower surface 292, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 294, or anterior surface.

Silicone may be positioned on one side, for example printed on or wiped on with a blade. An even thinner layer can be achieved applying silicone dissolved in solvent and then removing the solvent through methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p0531" num="0531">The thin flap lens covering may comprise silicone hydrogel which offers good oxygen permeability and allows for the transport of metabolites.</p>
<p id="p0532" num="0532">The thin flap lens covering may also comprise gelatin attached thereto. The gelatin may be crosslinked, which can provide the ability to maintain the pre-formed shape of the lens, or non-crosslinked, which can offer the advantage of dispersing under the other materials of the thin flap lens covering. The gelatin may be crosslinked using glutaraldehyde, UV, or riboflavin, and many known methods of cross-linking. A heavily crosslinked gelatin on the anterior surface may be used to promote lubricity on the thin flap lens covering.</p>

<p id="p0534" num="0534">The materials shown in Table IIIA and Table IIIB can be modified in many ways for incorporation in accordance with examples of the present disclosure. The hydrogel lenses and materials shown in Table IIIA can be modified in many ways, for example to include a hydrophobic layer, such that water permeability is reduced to deturgesce the cornea, and a peripheral structure included to at least one of seal or adhere the lens to the cornea. The silicone hydrogel lenses and materials shown in Table IIIB can be modified in many ways, for example to include a peripheral hydrophobic surface to suck down against the epithelium and form a seal with the corneal epithelium. The silicone hydrogel materials may comprise less hydrogel and more silicone, so as to decrease the transmission of water through the lens and increase oxygen permeability. The central portion of the above lenses and materials may also comprise a thickness of no more than about 200 um, for example 100 um, and that is substantially uniform, such that the central portion conforms to the ablated cornea with no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power from the central portion<!-- EPO <DP n="123"> --> when the lens is sucked down against the cornea. Many additional modifications will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art based on the drawings and descriptions included herein.</p>
<p id="p0535" num="0535">A contact lens may be placed over the thin flap lens covering, for example a contact lens adhered to the epithelium as described above.</p>
<p id="p0536" num="0536"><figref idref="f0090">Fig. 29A-2</figref> shows a thin covering 2900 as in <figref idref="f0089">Fig. 29A- 1</figref> sized to extend beyond an epithelial debridement area 11. This sizing may facilitate centripetal epithelial in growth under the covering. This size may also form a seal between the covering and the epithelium 12, for example epithelium that is not debrided and includes hemidesmosomes to adhere to the epithelium to the Bowman's membrane. The covering can adhere to the cornea with a physiologic sucking mechanism. A contact lens may be placed over the covering and adhered to the cornea, for example adhered as described above.</p>
<p id="p0537" num="0537"><figref idref="f0090">Fig. 29A-3</figref> shows a thin covering 2900 as in <figref idref="f0090">Fig. 29A-2</figref> size to fit an epithelial debridement area 11. The covering can be sized to fit the epithelial debridement area, for example a circular debridement area. This sizing may provide a seal of the covering with the epithelium around the periphery of the covering similar to a LASIK flap. A portion of the covering may be glued to the epithelium, for example with fibrin glue, to form a hinge. A thin layer of glue may also be placed under the flap covering. Alternatively, the thin covering may be sized smaller than the debrided area. In such a case, the epithelium may grow preferentially under the thin covering. The diameter of the thin covering may be within a range from about 6 to 11 mm or more, and the upper limit of the diameter may be determined by the diameter of the cornea at the limbus, such that the diameter of the thin covering is sized smaller than the diameter of the cornea at the limbus.</p>
<p id="p0538" num="0538"><figref idref="f0091">Figs. 29A-4 and 29A-5</figref> shows a thin covering 2900 comprising a hydrophobic portion 2906 to decrease water flow and a hydrophilic portion 2908 to contact ablated stroma. The hydrophobic portion can control edema, for example by decreasing water flow through the covering, even inhibiting water flow through the covering. The hydrophobic portion may also prevent infection by preventing bacteria from accessing the debrided zone. The hydrophilic portion can assist in the sucking down of the flap. As the stroma comprises a hydrophilic material, a hydrophilic surface of the covering to contact the stroma can improve contact of the flap with the ablated stroma and/or Bowman's, and may even adhere the flap to stroma when the cornea is deturgesced by endothelial pumping. The hydrophilic surface of the covering can also increase friction and may decrease<!-- EPO <DP n="124"> --> sliding of the covering when the cornea is deturgesced by endothelial pumping. As the epithelium grows under the covering, the hydrophilic surface of the covering may contact and hydrophobic surface of the corneal epithelium. This contact of the hydrophilic surface of the covering with the epithelium that may be hydrophobic can facilitate removal of the covering when the epithelium regenerates, and the covering can be separated from the regenerated epithelium such that the regenerated epithelium remains intact on the cornea.</p>
<p id="p0539" num="0539">The hydrophobic portion and the hydrophilic portion may comprise, respectively, many hydrophobic and many hydrophilic materials as described herein. For example the hydrophilic portion may comprise a thin covering comprising an amniotic membrane or components of amnion. The amniotic membrane component may be formed from amniotic membranes, for example as known in the art. The amniotic membrane may comprise donor tissue which is adequately tested to prevent transmission of disease and processed so as to maximize resiliency and wound healing properties. At least one other component may be attached to the amniotic membrane. The at least one other component may comprise a second hydrophobic material, so as to help control edema and prevent tear fluid from penetrating to the epithelial defect of the eye. The hydrophobic material component may comprise a silicone polymer, for example room temperature vulcanized silicone, thinly applied by brushing or deposition onto the amniotic membrane. The hydrophobic layer may comprise a biologic tissue grown or adhered to the amniotic layer, such as an epithelial layer.</p>
<p id="p0540" num="0540">The hydrophobic portion may be covered by a hydrophilic surface, for example plasma treated, and may also be covered by a hydrophilic layer, for example hyaluronic acid (HA). For example, the amniotic membrane may be covered by a silicone hydrophobic layer, which, in turn, is covered by a hydrophilic or lubricious coating, for example lubricious surface coatings commercially available under the trademark Isurtec™, as provided by Innovative Surface Technology, Inc. of Saint Paul, Minnesota, and as available from Surmodics of Eden Prairie Minnesota. Other examples of plasma treatment materials include vinyl pyrrolidone, diols, ethylene glycol and tetraethyl ethylene glycol. The hydrophilic or lubricious coating can reduce friction between the thin covering and the bandage lens or the lid of the eye. The plasma treatment may<br/>
create a mechanical lock-a layer to seal a surface to which other material can bond- and a layer to increase wettability or lubricity. Examples of materials that can be made to bond following plasma treatment include collagen or gelatin. Plasma treatment may be further crosslinked by using glutaraldehyde. The amniotic membrane comprises an epithelial side, containing an<!-- EPO <DP n="125"> --> epithelial cell layer, and a stromal or collagen side comprising fibroblast. For various reasons it may be advantageous to leave one or the other of these sides exposed to cover the patient tissue (stroma) and the other covered by a coating such as those described above. For example, the epithelium of the amniotic membrane may be covered with a hydrophilic silicone coating such that the fibroblast containing collagenous layer of the amniotic membrane is exposed for placement against the exposed stromal tissue of the patient. Alternatively, the collagenous fibroblast containing layer of the amniotic membrane may be covered with a hydrophilic silicone coating such that the epithelial layer of the amniotic membrane is exposed for placement against the exposed stromal tissue of the patient.</p>
<p id="p0541" num="0541"><figref idref="f0092">Fig. 29B-1</figref> shows a silicone flap covering 2910 comprising peripheral portion 2912 and a central portion 2914. The central portion may comprise a thin portion, for example a thin layer, of an elastic material, for example an elastomer such as silicone. The central portion can comprise a hydrophilic surface and may comprise, for example, silicone elastomer treated with surface treatment such as plasma oxidation to produce glassy islands or a 25 nm plasma coating with high reactive index. The peripheral portion can be shaped in many ways and may comprise a peripheral ring 2916 to hold the central portion in place. The peripheral portion may be more rigid than the central portion. The central portion can be configured to adhere to the cornea similar to the contact lens examples described above. For example the peripheral portion may comprise many of the above structures to adhere the covering to the cornea, for example including but not limited to at least one of a hydrophobic surface, protrusions, tacks, holes, channels, tubes, wedges, clips, needles, sutures or nitinol.</p>
<p id="p0542" num="0542"><figref idref="f0093">Fig. 29B-2</figref> shows a flap covering 2910 as in <figref idref="f0092">Fig. 29B- 1</figref> contacting a stromal tissue surface. The stromal tissue surface may comprise an ablated stromal tissue 11 surface of a PRK patient. The ring 291 6 can be positioned on the epithelium 12 away from the epithelial defect. The flap covering, for example the silicone flap covering, can be sucked down onto the stroma with endothelial pumping and displaced as the epithelium advances centripetally.</p>
<p id="p0543" num="0543"><figref idref="f0094">Fig. 29C</figref> shows a curved covering 2920 comprising a curved central portion 2920CP adapted to conform to the cornea and a curved peripheral portion 2920PP to seal against the cornea and placement of the covering on the cornea. The peripheral portion may comprise a lower surface radius of curvature, as described above. The radius of curvature of the lower surface may comprise a value that corresponds to the radius of curvature of the cornea such that the peripheral portion of<!-- EPO <DP n="126"> --> the lens is fit to the unablated cornea comprising the epithelium. The central portion can be sized to fit over the ablated cornea 11 and may comprise a lower surface with a radius of curvature that approximates the radius of curvature of the cornea after the ablation. For example, the radius of curvature of the central potion may be greater than the radius of curvature of the peripheral portion with a patient receiving a myopic PRK correction. The central portion may comprise a lens, for example a lens with no optical power and uniform thickness 2921, such that the lens can conform to the ablated stromal surface. The covering may comprise a water inhibiting hydrophobic layer 2922 to inhibit or minimize corneal swelling, for example a silicone elastomer layer. The water inhibiting layer may comprise a non-water permeable layer composed of a hydrophilic material, such as silicone hydrogel that minimizes permeability of the layer to water.</p>
<p id="p0544" num="0544">The surfaces of the covering can be configured in many ways so as to optimize the adherence of the covering to the cornea. For example, the peripheral portion 2920PP may comprise a hydrophobic surface so as to increase the coefficient of friction such that the peripheral portion comprises a sticky surface to contact and adhere to the corneal epithelium. The covering may comprise a hydrophilic layer 2924 to contact the stroma, for example a hydrophilic surface coating. The inner portion and the outer portion can be sized such that the hydrophobic outer portion contacts the intact epithelium and the inner portion contacts the stroma.</p>
<p id="p0545" num="0545">The lens can be fit to the cornea in many ways, for example the lens covering can be selected from among of a plurality of lens coverings, such that the peripheral portion fits the undebrided epithelium. Although the peripheral portion can be fit in many ways, for example a loose fit, the fit may also comprise a tight fit to form a seal, for example with a radius of curvature of the peripheral portion fitting the radius of curvature of the cornea to within about +/-0.1 mm, or about +/- 0.5 D for a 44 D peripheral cornea. The tight fit may comprise a steep fit with the radius of curvature of the lens shorter than the radius of curvature of the cornea such that the peripheral portion of the lens that contacts the cornea is steeper than the cornea. The radius of the lens can be determined preoperatively with known lens fitting techniques, such as fluorescein installation and slip lamp examination.</p>
<p id="p0546" num="0546"><figref idref="f0095 f0096">Figs 29C1 to 29C4</figref> show an example method of covering an ablated cornea with a covering.</p>
<p id="p0547" num="0547"><figref idref="f0095">Fig. 29C1</figref> shows a flat casting 2926 of substantially uniform thickness 2928. The flat casting can be formed by curing a material, between plates. The material may comprise many of the<!-- EPO <DP n="127"> --> materials described above, for example fibrin. The casting can be cut, for example with a trephine to form a circular covering 2930. The casting may be ablated to a desired thickness, for example with an excimer laser.</p>
<p id="p0548" num="0548"><figref idref="f0095">Fig. 29C2</figref> shows the covering comprising the circular casting 2930 positioned above the cornea, for example a post PRK cornea in a first flat configuration. The covering is aligned with the debrided region, for example the ablated region of the cornea.</p>
<p id="p0549" num="0549"><figref idref="f0095">Fig. 29C3</figref> shows the covering comprising the circular casting 2930 positioned on the cornea and conforming to corneal surface, for example the ablated stroma 16 and/or Bowman's 14 membrane. The covering is sized to fit within the epithelial defect.</p>
<p id="p0550" num="0550"><figref idref="f0096">Fig. 29C4</figref> show a contact lens 2934 positioned over the circular covering 2930. The contact lens may comprise many of the contact lenses described above. The contact lens may hold the covering in place over the epithelial defect when the epithelium regenerates.</p>
<p id="p0551" num="0551"><figref idref="f0096">Fig 29C5</figref> shows a covering 2930 for use with the method as in <figref idref="f0095 f0096">Figs. 29C 1-29C4</figref> with the covering sized to extend beyond the debrided area 11. This sizing of the covering may be used with a contact lens, as described above. This sizing may facilitate regeneration of the epithelium 12 over the ablated stroma 11 and may help to seal the covering against the cornea, as described above.</p>
<p id="p0552" num="0552"><figref idref="f0096">Fig 29C6</figref> shows in situ ablation 2936 of a covering 2930 to correct vision of a patient after ablation of the stroma 16 to correct vision. The covering can be ablated in situ on the cornea. The covering can be ablated in many ways, for example to thin the covering for conformance to the underlying stromal ablation. The covering may also be ablated so as to shape the covering with optical power to correct vision of the patient. The covering may comprise a conformable covering that conforms to the cornea when the covering is placed on the cornea.</p>
<p id="p0553" num="0553">The ablatable covering may comprise many materials, for example as described above. The ablatable covering may comprise collagen combined with polymer such as Neoglycopolymer-crosslinked biopolymer matrix as described by <patcit id="pcit0088" dnum="US2007002046A"><text>US Pub.

<p id="p0555" num="0555"><figref idref="f0097">Fig. 29C8-1</figref> shows a curved covering 2930 adapted to conform to the cornea and placement of the covering on a debrided and ablated cornea. The covering comprises a peripheral portion 2930PP to contact the epithelium 12 and a central portion 2930CP to contact the stroma 16 and/or Bowman's. The peripheral portion of the covering can be fit to the cornea, for example as described above. The lower surface of the covering may comprise a radius, radius as described above, that is substantially similar for the central and peripheral portions.</p>
<p id="p0556" num="0556"><figref idref="f0097">Fig. 29C8-2</figref> shows the covering 2930 of <figref idref="f0097">Fig. 29C8-1</figref> conforming to the ablated surface contour. The central portion 2930CP of the covering can be sucked down against the stroma 16 and/or Bowman's membrane such that the covering conforms to the ablated surface. The central portion may comprise a thin material of substantially uniform thickness to conform to the ablated cornea when the central portion is sucked down against the cornea with endothelial pumping and deturgescence. The covering may also be sufficiently thin and soft so as to conform to the epithelium 12 around the boundary of the epithelial defect.</p>

The aberration ablated into the eye may comprise aberrations ablated in response to aberration measured with a wavefront aberrometer such as a known Hartmann-Shack wavefront aberrometer 2942. The aberration may comprise many known aberrations such as spherical aberrations and coma.</p>
<p id="p0558" num="0558"><figref idref="f0098">Fig. 29D</figref> shows an erodible covering 2944. The covering can be configured to erode such that the cover erodes inwardly away from the regenerating corneal epithelium. The covering may comprise an outer portion, for example a peripheral portion, configured to erode at a first rate and an inner portion, for example a central portion, configured to erode at a second rate. For example, the outer portion can be configured to erode within 24 hours of placement on the eye and the inner portion is configured to erode 48 hours after placement on the eye. The outer portion erosion rate is faster than the inner erosion rate to erode the outer portion of the covering before the inner portion of the covering. Such erosion can be helpful to improve fitting of the covering to the exposed ablation surface, for example when the epithelium advances centripetally. For example, the covering may comprise a first portion configured to erode in 12 hours, a second portion 2946 configured to erode in 24 hours 2948, a third portion configured to erode in 48 hours 2950 and a fourth portion configured to erode in 72 hours 2952.<!-- EPO <DP n="129"> --></p>
<p id="p0559" num="0559">The outer portion, for example the first portion, may comprise a first amount of crosslinking, and the inner portion, for example the second portion, may comprise a second amount of cross linking to erode the outer portion before the inner portion. The cross-linking can be configured in many ways, for example with known crosslinking such as that used to manufacture 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour collagen shields. A collagen shields that is known erode is the ProShield™ available from Alcon Laboratories, Inc.; such a shield can be modified to incorporate zones that erode at different times and rates.</p>
<p id="p0560" num="0560">The outer portion and the inner portion may comprise many arrangements of portions of the covering. For example, the outer portion may comprise a first outer portion and a second outer portion peripheral to the first outer portion, and the inner portion may comprise a first inner portion and a second inner portion with the second inner portion disposed inward from the first inner portion.</p>
<p id="p0561" num="0561"><figref idref="f0099">Fig. 29E1</figref> shows a covering 2954 with a hydrophobic layer and a hydrophilic layer. The covering comprises an upper surface 2956 and a lower surface 2958. The covering also comprises a hydrophobic layer 2960 and a hydrophilic layer 2962. The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer are each disposed between the upper surface and the lower surface. The hydrophilic layer is disposed closer to the lower surface and may comprise the lower surface, and the hydrophobic layer is disposed closer to the upper surface and may comprise the upper surface. The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer each comprise a thickness, and the thickness of each layer can be configured in many ways to enhance the performance of the covering. For example, at least one of the hydrophilic layer or the hydrophobic layer comprises at least one monolayer, and the at least one monolayer comprises a thickness 2964 of no more than about 40 nm.</p>
<p id="p0562" num="0562">The hydrophilic layer may comprise the functions of encouraging healthy epithelial growth, taking metabolites, and cushioning the cornea. The hydrophilic layer may comprise many known hydrophilic materials, surfaces and coatings and can be formed in many ways and may comprise a known coating. Hydrophilic coatings, surfaces and materials are commercially available from Surmodics, Hydromer Biocoat, HorshamPA, Hyluran, Hydromer, and the coating may comprise hyaluronic acid (HA) coatings, monolayers and a plasma treated surface. The hydrophilic layer may comprise an optically transparent gel comprising at least about 10% water. The gel may comprise a non-water containing hydrophilic gel, for example NuSiI, a very soft silicone that can be formulated so as to promote re-epithelialization by minimizing the force needed to disconnect the stroma from<!-- EPO <DP n="130"> --> the thin therapeutic covering.

The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer each comprise a thickness. The hydrophilic layer thickness can be at least about twice the thickness of the hydrophobic layer. For example the hydrophilic layer can be at least about ten times as thick as the hydrophobic layer. The hydrophobic layer may comprise a monolayer, for example a monolayer no more than about 40 nm thick. The thicker hydrophilic layer may have some advantages. For example, the thicker hydrophilic layer comprises a water density that is hyperosmotic relative to the normal hydration of the cornea, such that the cornea can be dried with the hyperosmotic hydrophilic layer.</p>

The thicker hydrophobic layer may be useful where it is desirable to decrease changes in thickness of the covering due to hydration of the underlying cornea.

The two monolayers can be tied together with a crosslinker such that the two monolayers are positioned opposite each other. The covering comprising the two monolayers can be very thin, for example about 100 nm.

The hydrophobic layer is disposed between the first hydrophilic layer and the second hydrophilic layer. A covering with an upper surface comprising a hydrophilic layer can help the tear film spread uniformly over the upper surface which can improve patient vision and decrease friction with at least one of a contact lens or the eyelid that contacts the upper surface and may move relative to the upper surface, for example when the patient blinks. The hydrophobic layer, for example silicone, may inhibit the flow of water through the covering.

The covering and corneal tissue may be roughened in many ways. For example, the lower surface can be microshaped using a femtosecond laser or an excimer laser. Work in relation to the present disclosure indicates that microshaping of the covering and/or recipient Bowman's 14 and/or stroma 16 can provide adhesion. The lower surface can be roughened with mechanical roughening such as scraping. The ablated corneal surface 11 of the recipient cornea may also be ablated and/or treated with a femtosecond laser or additional ablation so as to microfinish the surface with roughness. Microfinishing may provide increased surface area so as to adhere the covering to the stroma and/or Bowman's with Van der Waals forces.</p>
<p id="p0572" num="0572">The ablated surface comprises a roughness and the lower surface of the covering may comprise a similar roughness. As both surfaces comprise comparable roughness, for example roughness on the order of about a micron, contact between the two surfaces can cause friction that can minimize sliding of the covering over the ablated surface when the covering is held against the ablated surface, for example with at least one of a contact lens or suction.</p>
<p id="p0573" num="0573">The lower surface can be configured for friction with the ablated stroma in many ways. For example the lower surface can be roughened, may comprise nano structures, and may comprise interlocking structures. The lower surface may comprise structures configured to interlock with collagen for adhesion, for example small protrusions, such as hairs, hooks, or pokers that extend downward to go around collagen fibers. The protrusions may comprise a density per square mm, and the density per square mm can be configured for the desired amount of adhesion and removal. A first force, or first pressure, may be used to apply the covering to the ablated stroma, and a second force, or second pressure, required for removal. The second force can be configured such that the covering is lifted by the epithelium when the epithelium regenerates.</p>
<p id="p0574" num="0574">The covering comprising the rough lower surface can be adhered to the lower surface, for example with fibrin. The covering may also be configured to crosslink to the stroma, for example with riboflavin. Many of the above adhesives can stick to the stroma and slough off the epithelium<!-- EPO <DP n="133"> --> when the epithelium regenerates. With both cross-linking and adhesives, the epithelium can grow under the covering so as to dislodge the covering when the epithelium grows centripetally during regeneration.</p>
<p id="p0575" num="0575">The covering can be removed with a solution that dissolves an adhesive. For example, the covering can be adhered with fibrin and a drop of a fibrin dissolving substance applied when the epithelium has regenerated. For example the fibrin dissolving substance may comprise known tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or a known plasmin.</p>

The lower surface portion may comprise a first amount of roughness for friction against the ablated stromal surface. This roughness of the lower surface can provide friction so as to resist sliding of the lower the lower surface portion along the stromal surface, for example when the patient blinks. The upper surface portion may comprise a second amount of roughness. The second amount of roughness can be less than the first amount of roughness, so as to slide the upper surface portion along at least one of a contact lens or an eyelid, for example when the patient blinks. This differential roughness of the upper and lower surfaces can retain the covering against the ablated stroma and minimize sliding of the covering against the ablated stroma, so as to decrease patient and irritation.</p>

For example, the first amount of roughness may be at least about twice the second amount of roughness. The upper surface portion comprises an optically smooth surface. For example, the optically smooth surface of the upper surface portion may comprise an RMS roughness for visual acuity of about 20/25 or better. The lower surface portion may comprise an optically rough surface. For example, the optically rough surface may comprise an RMS roughness for a visually acuity less than about 20/25 or better before the covering is placed against the cornea, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="134"> --> visual acuity of at least about 20/25 or better when the covering is placed on the cornea.

For example, the outer portion may comprise a thickness from about 20 to about 100 microns, and may comprise a Shore A hardness durometer parameter within a range from about 20 to about 60.</p>
<p id="p0604" num="0604">The covering 2990 can be configured in many ways so as to seal the cornea. The outer portion and inner portion comprise a radius of curvature 2990R. The radius of curvature 2990R can be the same for both the inner portion and the outer portion. For example, the radius of each the inner portion and the outer portion may comprise about 7.5 mm. Alternatively, the inner portion may comprise a radius of curvature fit to the ablation profile, and the outer portion may comprise a<!-- EPO <DP n="141"> --> radius of curvature fit to the unablated peripheral epithelium corresponding to the pre-ablation radius of curvature, as described above.</p>

The inner portion 2994 is positioned over the ablation 20. The inner portion can be sized smaller than the ablation such that the outer portion 2992 extends at least partially over the ablation and the edge of the epithelium. The outer portion 2992 extends over the boundary of the ablation 2OB and the edge of epithelium 12 so as to conform to the epithelium and the edge of the ablation such that the lens is sealed on the cornea.</p>

The outer portion can comprise a size and a thickness so as to conform with the epithelium at the edge of the epithelial defect 12E and at the edge of the ablation 2OB. For example, the thickness may comprise about 20 um at the periphery of the outer portion and extend to the central portion with an increasing thickness to about 50 microns. The outer portion may comprise a Shore A durometer hardness parameter of about 20 to about 40. The thickness can be increased as the durometer is decreased. For example, the thickness may extend from about 20 um at the periphery to about 100 microns near the inner portion. As the endothelial suction may not take effect immediately, contact lens may be positioned over the covering 2990 to retain the covering such that the covering can be pulled down ward against the epithelium with endothelial suction so as to seal the covering. The covering 2990 may be retained with many structures, adhesives and photosensitizers as described above.</p>
<p id="p0607" num="0607"><figref idref="f0113">Fig. 29N-3</figref> shows the inner portion of the therapeutic covering as in <figref idref="f0111">Figs. 29N and 29N- 1</figref> with an optical surface disposed over regenerating corneal epithelium. The optical surface may comprise upper surface 2994U of inner portion 2994L. Work in relation to embodiments suggests that the epithelium can be somewhat irregular during regeneration, and that this irregularity can contribute to decreased vision. Inner portion 2994 comprises sufficient rigidity such that the inner portion retains the optical shape of the surfaces. For example, when irregular epithelium regenerated under the inner portion, the inner portion may separate slightly from the ablated surface such that the inner portion floats on the regenerating epithelium. As the regenerated epithelium may be subject to suction of the endothelium due so sealing and endothelial pumping, the irregular epithelium can be smoothed by the lower optical surface of the inner portion so as to improve<!-- EPO <DP n="142"> --> patient vision, for example to about 20/30 or better when the epithelium has regenerated at three days post-op. As the epithelium may continue to smooth after re-epithelialization, the covering may be positioned on the cornea for more than three days, for example 7 days or more and even one month.</p>
<p id="p0608" num="0608">The upper and lower surfaces of the inner portion can be curved in many ways to provide functional patient vision of at least 20/40 (metric 6/12) or better, for example 20/30 (metric 6/9) or better.

The lower surface 2994U may comprise a radius of curvature so as to correspond to the ablation 20, as described above.</p>

The outer portion 2992 may comprise a thickness of no more than about 100 microns. For example the outer portion may comprise a thickness of about 50 microns at the boundary with the inner portion, and linearly taper from 50 microns at the boundary with the inner portion to about 20 microns at the periphery of the outer portion. The inner portion may comprise a thickness of no more than about 200 microns. For example, the inner portion may comprise a thickness of about 100 microns. Many materials can be used as described above. For example, the single piece covering may comprise silicone having a water content within a range from about 0.1 % to about 10%, for example no more than about 1%, and a hardness Shore A durometer parameter within a range from about 20 to about 70, for example about 30.</p>

The central inner portion may comprise a rigid central portion, of a higher durometer, of 3 -4 mm in diameter to improve visual acuity in patients. This optically clear central portion may be up to 6mm in diameter, for example. The central inner portion may provide optical power when placed on the eye, although patients receiving refractive vision correction such as PRK may not benefit from such refractive power such that the inner lens portion may comprise no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power. The center portion may comprise many materials, for example an RGP material. The peripheral outer portion may comprise a less rigid material, of a lower durometer, than the central portion so as to conform to the cornea along the epithelium and around the debrided edge and the edge of the ablation. Since optical clarity may not play a substantial role in the peripheral portion, the peripheral portion may comprise a transparent or opaque material. For example the peripheral portion may comprise an opaque material so as to define an aperture of the inner portion, for example a pinhole as described above.</p>

A step 30D05 measures the patient correction, for example a vision correction. A step 30D 10 determines an ablation profile in response to the vision correction. A step 3OD 15 places a speculum in the eye of the patient, for example a physician placing the speculum in the eye of the patient to keep the eyelids separated and the cornea exposed. A step 30D20 removes the epithelium, for example with known methods as described above. A step 30D25 ablates the eye to correct vision, for example with known ablation profiles as described above. A step 30D30 places a therapeutic covering on the eye. The therapeutic covering may be placed on the eye after ablation and before the eye is hydrated when the speculum is placed against the eyelids. When the speculum is placed against the eyelids, the eyelids cannot blink to hydrate the eye and the cornea may dry. The covering may comprise an amount of hydration that is dryer than normally hydrated corneal tissue that comprises about 85% water, so as to adhere the covering to the stromal tissue. For example, the covering may comprise hyperosmotic hydration relative to the normally hydrated cornea, so as to adhere the covering to the cornea. A step 30D35 conforms the covering to the ablated corneal surface. The covering can be conformed to the corneal surface when positioned on the corneal surface, for example with pressure to the covering. A step 30D40 places a contact lens over the eye, for example a contact lens as described above. The covering may form a seal with the corneal epithelium when the covering conforms to the cornea. A step 30D45 adheres the contact lens to the cornea, for example as described above. A step 30D50 hydrates the eye, for example with saline from an artificial source. A step 30D55 removes the speculum from the eye, such that the patient can blink. A step 30D60 deturgesces the cornea, for example with endothelial pumping. A step 30D65 adheres the covering to the cornea with endothelial suction. A step 30D70 decreases pain, decreases swelling and improves vision, for example in response to deturgescence of the<!-- EPO <DP n="145"> --> cornea . A step 30D75 regenerates the epithelium, for example such that the epithelium grows over the ablated corneal stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A step 30D80 hydrates the contact lens, for example in preparation for removal of the contact lens. A step 30D85 removes the contact lens. A step 30D90 hydrates the therapeutic covering, for example in preparation for removal of the therapeutic covering. Another step can be to apply an oil, such as silicone oil to the eye, for example when the covering comprises silicone. A step 30D95 removes the covering so as to separate the covering from the underlying regenerated epithelium, such that the underlying regenerated epithelium remains intact over the ablated stroma and/or epithelium.</p>

<p id="p0623" num="0623">Reducing Corneal Edema for Improving Vision in Patients Following Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)</p>
<heading id="h0013"><b><u>Background:</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0624" num="0624">PRK is a well established procedure for refractive correction for close to 20 years. One of its main draw backs is deteriorated visual acuity during the first postoperative days. Surface<!-- EPO <DP n="146"> --> irregularity of the ablated area, epithelial initial irregular growth pattern and anterior stromal edema may play a role in such reduced vision. If stromal edema can be reduced during the first post-operative days, vision can be preserved. To establish what is the role of edema in vision recovery following PRK it can be important to establish whether dehydrating the cornea of the post-operative edema can significantly improve vision in patients following PRK. Dehydration of edematous corneas using Glycerin solution, a hyperosmotic agent, can be performed in the ophthalmologist's office to reduce edema when such edema obscures objects seen through the cornea. Glycerin can have a short lasting effect (minutes) and may temporarily dehydrate the edematous cornea. The purpose of this study is to examine if reduction of corneal edema using glycerin can improve patient's vision following PRK.</p>

<p id="p0656" num="0656"><figref idref="f0120">Fig. 31A</figref> shows measured corneal edema immediately following PRK surgery and one day post-op with PRK patients. The corneal edema can be measure with pachymetry by comparing the pre-op values to the post-op values. The day of surgery, day 0, the edema is about 100 um in the measure patients. At one day post-op, the swelling is about 140 um. This data shows the cornea swells following PRK both the day of surgery and the following day.</p>
<p id="p0657" num="0657"><figref idref="f0120">Fig. 31B</figref> shows a model for corneal swelling with PRK patients as in <figref idref="f0120">Fig. 31A</figref>. After PRK the epithelium has an epithelial defect 11 that allows water to enter the cornea 10 through the ablated stroma 16. This water passes through the cornea and is pumped from the cornea by the corneal endothelium 18. The amount of water that enters the cornea through the epithelial defect can exceed the pumping rate of the corneal endothelium, such that the cornea swell, for example in an anterior portion of the stroma 16 where the cornea is ablated.</p>
<p id="p0658" num="0658">Fig- 32A shows measured corneal edema immediately following LASIK surgery and one day post-op with LASIK patients. The day of surgery, day 0, the corneal swelling is about 100 um, similar to the PRK patients. At one day post-op the corneal swelling is about 30 um. The 110 um difference in swelling between the PRK corneas and the LASIK corneas shows that PRK corneas swell more than LASIK corneas, at least for the first day post-op. As LASIK patients report less<!-- EPO <DP n="154"> --> pain and have better vision at one day post-op than PRK patients, this data shows that swelling of the cornea can significantly effect patient comfort and may also effect patient vision.</p>
<p id="p0659" num="0659"><figref idref="f0121">Fig. 32B</figref> shows a model for corneal swelling with LASIK patients as in <figref idref="f0120">Fig. 3IA</figref>. With LASIK, a flap 3200 of corneal tissue is cut and moved to the side with a hinge that connects the flap to the cornea, and the exposed stromal tissue 16 ablated is ablated 11. The flap is repositioned on the cornea over the stromal ablation. As the flap retains the corneal epithelium, the flap may comprise a barrier to water entry of the corneal stroma. At surgery, the epithelium has not regenerated between the flap and the cornea, such that water can enter at the margin of the flap 3204. At one day post-op for LASIK, the epithelium can cover the margin of the flap to seal the cornea, such that the endothelium can effectively deturgesce the cornea so as to decrease swelling. Consequently, the cornea swells less with LASIK at one day post-op and patients report less pain and better vision.</p>
<p id="p0660" num="0660"><figref idref="f0122">Figs. 33A and 33B</figref> show pre-op and post-op pachymetry measurements on patients with a Pentacam™ to determine corneal edema at one day post-op. A Pentacam™ is a known device for mapping the thickness of the cornea and is commercially available from Oculus, Inc. of Lynwood, WA. <figref idref="f0122">Fig. 33A</figref> shows the pre-op pachymetry map of a patient that is a - 1.25 myope. The combined thickness of the pre-operative cornea comprising the endothelium, stroma, Bowman's membrane and epithelium is 524 um. The pre-operative thickness includes 60 um of corneal epithelium that is debrided. The thickness of the post operative cornea is 537 um. The edema of the cornea can be calculated from the change in pachymetry, the thickness of the epithelium and the thickness of the ablation. The pre operative cornea comprises a stromal thickness of about 464 microns, and is ablated with about 24 microns, such that the pachymetry should be about 440 um post-op. The measured corneal thickness is about 537 um post-op, which is 97 microns more than the theoretical pachymetry post-op due to swelling of the stroma.</p>
<p id="p0661" num="0661"><figref idref="f0123">Figs. 34A and 34B</figref> show pre-op and post-op pachymetry measurements on patients with a OCT to determine corneal edema at one day post-op. OCT, also referred to as optical coherence tomography, is a known and commercially available method of measuring corneal thickness. <figref idref="f0123">Fig. 34A</figref> shows the pre-operative corneal thickness as 458 microns, which includes 60 um of epithelium. The cornea was ablated with a targeted ablation depth of 24 microns. <figref idref="f0123">Fig. 34B</figref> shows the post-ablation stromal thickness to be 514 microns by OCT. Without swelling, the post-operative corneal<!-- EPO <DP n="155"> --> thickness would have been 434 um (5 18 - 60 - 24) microns. The measured thickness of 5 14 microns indicates approximately 80 microns of corneal swelling.</p>
<p id="p0662" num="0662"><figref idref="f0124">Fig. 35</figref> shows loss of visual acuity and cornea edema with PRK for patients the day of surgery within about one hour of surgery, measured in accordance with the above protocols. For example, patient one OD (ocular dexter, or right eye), shows a pre-op corrected visual acuity of 20/25. One day post op the vision is 20/50 with a bandage lens (BL) and 20/50 with a rigid gas permeable lens (RGP). Therefore, post-op this patient has lost about 3 lines of visual acuity at one day post op. The edema based on OCT is about 70 um. The left eye, OS, of patient 1 shows similar results. Patients 2 and 3 show similar results.</p>
<p id="p0663" num="0663"><figref idref="f0125">Fig. 36</figref> shows loss of visual acuity and cornea edema with PRK patients one day after surgery, measure in accordance with the above protocols. These data show a loss of visual acuity and corneal swelling similar to <figref idref="f0124">Fig. 35</figref>. The edema of patient 1 OS is about 166 microns, and the edema of patient 2 OD is about 104. The last row shows the change in corneal edema from the day of surgery to the first day post-op (Baseline Pa@PRK day - Pa@lst day). The visual acuity of patient 2 with the right eye is 20/40 without a bandage lens (BL) and is correctable to 20/22 with a bandage lens, which indicates that post-operative swelling of the cornea can effect visual acuity.</p>
<p id="p0664" num="0664">Also, the patients were treated with glycerin and Healon® to determine the effect of corneal drying, in accordance with the above protocols. These data show that glycerin with a bandage contact lens can improve visual acuity (VA wo/BL GIy 1) with the first application at about 1 minute, which show visual acuity without a bandage lens improving by two lines in both the right and left eyes of patient 1 from about 20/50 and 20/66, respectively, to about 20/33 and 20/40. Subsequent applications of glycerin did not improve visual acuity (VA wo/BL + GIy 2). This may be due to penetration of the corneal stroma by the glycerin so as to decrease the hyperosmotic effect of the glycerin on the stroma. The subsequent treatment of the eyes with Healon, which has a higher molecular weight than glycerin, may not penetrate the stroma and may be effective to reduce swelling, for example as a filler material as described above. The initial testing with Healon (VA+RGB+Healon) did showed an improvement in vision over the second application in glycerin in both eyes of patient 1, and not with the right eye of patient 3. Further experiments and refinements can be made on an empirical number of patients.<!-- EPO <DP n="156"> --></p>

<heading id="h0043">1. Standard Fibrin Formulation Membrane:</heading>
<p id="p0674" num="0674">The fibrinogen component of a standard fibrin sealant such as Tisseal™ (Baxter Biosurgery) is reconstituted with half of the supplied aprotinin solution at 370C on a heated stir plate such as Fibrotherm™, Baxter Biosurgery, by stirring for at least 5 minutes. Once the lyophilize is completely dissolved, the solution is allowed to sit for at least 30 minutes until all entrapped air bubbles have dissipated. The thrombin component is reconstituted with the supplied 40 mM CaC12 solution, then diluted 9:1 v/v with more 40 mM CaC12, to produce a 50 unit/mL thrombin solution. Each component is loaded into syringes, taking care to not introduce air bubbles, and mounted into a dual syringe tissue adhesive applicator such as DuploJect from Baxter Biosurgery. An applicator tip either with or without an in-line static mixer, is attached to the end of the syringe joiner piece. Glass slides are prepared by adhering w/medical device grade cyanoacrylate metal shim strips (approximately 25 um thick) along the edges, then washing and rinsing. An amount of the two part mixture is then applied to the glass slide sufficient to cover it, then another clean glass slide without shim strips is placed atop the solution and pressed down gently but firmly onto the shim strips. The glass slide assembly containing the entrapped fibrin is allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight. Once the gel has dried, the glass slides are pried apart, the fibrin rinsed with saline, and peeled off, then washed and rinsed in several changes of sterile saline and allowed to dry again and trephined to produce circular implants. The membranes are then placed in appropriate packaging and sterilized by gamma radiation (approximately 25 kGy). Prior to application onto the cornea, the membrane is rehydrated with saline.<!-- EPO <DP n="158"> --></p>
<heading id="h0044">2. Optically Clear Custom Fibrin Formulation Membrane:</heading>
<p id="p0675" num="0675">To produce an optically clear fibrin membrane, the fibrinogen component of the fibrin sealant is reconstituted with only half of the supplied aprotinin solution in the same manner as for the standard formulation. The thrombin is reconstituted with 300 mM NaCI and 40 mM to produce a 50 U/mL solution. The membrane production then proceeds in the same manner as for the standard fibrin formulation.</p>
<heading id="h0045">3. BSA-Glutaraldehyde Membrane:</heading>
<p id="p0676" num="0676">Sterile 30% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-AIdrich) is loaded into a syringe. A 4% glutaraldehyde solution is prepared and loaded into a second syringe. Both components are loaded onto a dual syringe tissue adhesive applicator such as DuploJect from Baxter Biosurgery) either with or without a static inline mixer. The membrane is then produced in the same manner as for the fibrin membranes, except more rinsing is used in order to remove unbound glutaraldehyde prior to gamma sterilization.</p>
<p id="p0677" num="0677">The optical and conforming properties of the covering can be improved with and improved casting process based on empirical laboratory and clinical studies, such that the covering can provide improved vision, for example 20/20 vision through the covering as measured with the air force resolution target. An improved casting process may comprise improving the mixing of the two solutions (fibrinogen and thrombin). For example by using a static mixer attached to the applicator. That way inhomogeneities in the ratios between the two components can be minimized or eliminated completely. A person can cast other fibrin formulations this way and the cast formulation can appear much more visually homogeneous. Such casting formulations can be made by one of ordinary skill in the art with time to do make this specific formulation, which can be the very clear fibrin. Further, laser ablation to affect further thinning of the material can result in improved optical quality, for example by rendering the covering clearer and this improvement may be quantified, for example by measuring the minimum angle of resolution of images through the covering. Also, gamma irradiation of the cast membrane can clarify the covering further. This has been observed with the clinical material as these materials have been laser thinned and gamma irradiated before human use.</p>

The<!-- EPO <DP n="159"> --> annular band is clearly visible in the picture. The wire extends horizontally along the band and is embedded in the band as described above. The wire successfully penetrated the underlying contact lens and anchored in the underlying stroma. The annular band can be adhered to a contact lens, for example and RGP contact lens so as to adhere the contact lens to the cornea with the annular band.</p>
<heading id="h0046">Pain Management:</heading>
<p id="p0679" num="0679">Experimentally it has been observed that edema can be caused by both a lack of water barrier function and decrease of oxygen. The thin lens covering can provide pain management both mechanically and metabolically. From a mechanical standpoint, the thin lens covering can provide a barrier against rubbing between the debrided zone and the inside of the eye lid. The thin lens covering may also comprise a barrier sealed against the epithelium so as to inhibit water entering the debrided area. From a metabolic standpoint, the thin lens covering comprises oxygen permeability so as to provide the oxygenation needed for corneal epithelium healing. For epithelial re-growth of the debrided epithelium, the oxygen requirement of the epithelium growing over the defect can much higher than for intact epithelium. Without adequate oxygenation, the epithelium may shift the metabolic pathway away from producing the carbon dioxide to producing lactic acid. The lactic acid can cause hyperosmosis in the epithelial and stromal layers and draw water into these layers which, in turn, may cause the cornea to swell. The decreased oxygen of the cornea may also cause nerve activation manifested by pain, for example nerve activation due to increase swelling.</p>

These data were obtained from clinical studies undertaken with PRK patients in accordance with the above described protocols. The data are shown for 17 patients for the control group and 10 test patients receiving the tested device.</p>
<p id="p0681" num="0681">Data are shown of patients' uncorrected visual acuity readings from 0 to 72 hours post-PRK The data shows the UCVA of 17 control patients wearing either Oasys Acuvue or Night &amp; Day CIBA Vision silicone hydrogel bandage lenses.

The UCVA measurements were taken at 0, 4,<!-- EPO <DP n="160"> --> 24, 48 and 72 hours. The patients wearing a silicone thin lens flap and on top of it a silicone hydrogel bandage contact lens for the purpose of the UCVA measurement, had better UCVA than the control group wearing a bandage lens only; at 72 hours the UCVA values for both sets of patients largely corresponded</p>
<p id="p0682" num="0682">The uncorrected visual acuity of the patients with the test silicone covering had a mean uncorrected visual acuity (20/XX) of 0.5 at about I hour post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean visual acuity of about 0.4 at about 1 hour post-op. At one day post-op, the test patients had an acuity of about 0.75 and the controls had a visual acuity of about 0.55. At two days post-op the test patients had a visual acuity of about 0.60 and the control patients had a visual acuity of about 0.45. These data show that the therapeutic covering can improve vision at a plurality of days comprising days one and two post-op, and one of ordinary skill in the art can improve vision based on the teachings described herein. At day three post-op, the test patients and the control patients each have similar visual acuities of about 0.6. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that the regenerated epithelium at day three may comprise some irregularities, and that one can improve the optical surface of the covering so as to improve the patient vision at day three based on the teachings described herein.</p>

The data shows the edema thickness (in um) of 17 control patients wearing either Oasys Acuvue or Night &amp; Day CIBA Vision silicone hydrogel bandage lenses. Ten patients wore a thin lens flap covering comprising NuSiI and plasma treated with carboxylated hydrocarbon surface on the front surface. The patients wearing a silicone thin lens flap had less edema than the control group wearing a bandage lens only; at 72 hours the edema values for both sets of patients were quite close.</p>
<p id="p0684" num="0684">The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 70 um at about 1 hour post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 80 um at about 1 hour post-op. The edema was calculated based on the pre-op corneal thickness as compared to post-op, and the calculated edema corrected for the ablation depth and the epithelial thickness. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 15 um, about 3%, at about 4 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45 um, about 10%, at about 4 hours post-op. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 3 um at about 24 hours post-op, less than 1%, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45 um, about 10%, at about 24 hours post-op. The mean<!-- EPO <DP n="161"> --> edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 5 um, about 1%, at about 48 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45%, about 10%, at about 48 hours post-op. Therefore, the test therapeutic covering reduced the mean edema to about 1 % or less for a plurality days comprising days one and two and the control patients showed an edema of about 10 % at these time periods. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 15 um, about 3%, at about 72 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 10 um, about 2%, at about 72 hours post-op. Work in relation to these studies suggest that oxygen permeability of the test covering may contribute to the corneal edema at day three post-op. Based on the teachings described herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art can decrease the permeability to decrease the edema of patients at day three post-op to within about 20 um, about 2%, or less, for example within about 10 um, about 1%. The thickness of the covering may be decreased so as to increase the oxygen permeability Dk parameter, and the parameter determined empirically.</p>

<p id="p0689" num="0689"><figref idref="f0136">Fig. 43</figref> shows an optical coherence tomography image of a therapeutic covering conforming to a de-epithelialized porcine eye. The pig eye was enucleated and debrided. The diameter of the debrided zone is approximately 2.5 mm. The thickness of the epithelium is shown as approximately 0.06 mm.</p>
<p id="p0690" num="0690">The thin lens flap covering comprises NuSiI grade 4930 and with a carboxylated plasma treated anterior surface has been draped over the debrided zone. The thin lens flap covering conforms to the surface of the eye, leaving no gaps between the posterior/bottom part of the lens and the surface of the cornea. The covering is shown conforming to irregularities of the cornea, including irregularities of the epithelium and stroma, such as the boundary of the epithelial defect. The covering comprised a thickness of about 50 um and a Shore A durometer of about 30. These data suggest suitable parameters for the peripheral portion such that the peripheral portion can conform to irregularities of the epithelium so as to seal the cornea, and that the inner portion may comprise a durometer of more than 30 when the inner portion is no more than about 50 um thick.<!-- EPO <DP n="163"> --></p>
<p id="p0691" num="0691">A person of ordinary skill in the art can conduct empirical studies to determine material properties, coatings and dimensions of a therapeutic covering for use after photorefractive keratectomy so as to provide improved water barrier function, decreased pain and increased visual acuity for days one to three post-op, even from days one to seven post-op. For example, a decreased thickness of the flap can result in decreased edema at three days post-op and may improve visual acuity at three days post-op. For example, parameters can be determined for a therapeutic covering so as to decrease average edema to no more than about 5%, decrease average pain, and provide an average visual acuity of at least about 20/30 or better in a population of patients for days one to three post. For example, the above experimental findings indicate that a thinner silicone flap can decrease swelling at days 1 and 3 post-op.</p>
<p id="p0692" num="0692">Clinical studies in accordance with the above described examples have shown that the cornea may comprise may corneal irregularities following PRK, and that the covering can decrease many of these irregularities. The irregularities can correspond to optical aberrations that decrease patient vision. In the first one to three days following PRK, the cornea can swell. The swelling of the corneal stroma can result in stromal irregularities. For example the stroma can swell so as to produce a central island, which can resolve when swelling is decreased and the epithelium covers the stroma and/or Bowman's. A central island may comprise an under ablated central portion that produces optical aberrations. Also, the boundary at the edge of the ablation may comprise a stroma irregularity. Clinical studies the Pentacam™ and topography systems have shown epithelial irregularities comprising the edge of the epithelial defect, and the epithelium can be somewhat irregular, even though the epithelium can cover the cornea. The epithelial irregularities may last for at least one week following PRK.</p>
<p id="p0693" num="0693">The empirical studies may comprise laboratory studies, for example of conformance of a covering to a target shape. For example, the covering can be placed over a 7.5 mm radius of curvature surface with a 2 mm hole in the middle of the test surface to simulate a corneal irregularity. With a inner portion that may be more soft than ideal, the inner portion may droop over the hole. The hardness and/or thickness of the inner portion can be increased such that the inner portion retains the optical shape and does not droop over the hole. For example, experiments have suggested that a 50 um uniform thickness covering with a Shore A durometer of 30 may droop slightly such that a thicker and/or harder covering may provide improved clinical results. Patients may be tested subsequent to laboratory testing to optimize empirically the parameter of the<!-- EPO <DP n="164"> --> therapeutic covering so as to achieve the above stated functions such as edema less than 5% and visual acuity of 20/30 or better.</p>
<p id="p0694" num="0694">An example of a therapeutic covering in accordance with the above may comprise a single piece of molded silicon having a water content of no more than about 2%, an outer portion with an outer size of about 7 to 9 mm across, for example 8 mm diameter, an inner portion with a size of about 3 to 5 mm across, for example 4 mm diameter. The silicone may comprise hardness corresponding to a Shore A durometer from within a range about 30 to about 70, for example a uniform hardness corresponding to a durometer of about 40. The thickness of the outer portion at the periphery may comprise about 10 to 40 microns across, for example 20 microns. The thickness can gradually increase toward an inner boundary of the outer portion having a thickness within a range from about 40 to 80 microns. The central portion may comprise an uniform thickness within a range from about 80 to 120 microns across, for example 100 microns. The covering comprising the molded single piece can be coated on the upper surface with a hydrophilic layer, for example a lubricous coating, and coated on the lower surface with a hydrophilic layer, for example a lubricous coating. The outer portion of the covering can conform to and seal against the undebrided epithelium and the peripheral Bowman's membrane with endothelial suction , as described above, and the central portion comprises an optical surface for vision which does not conform to irregularities of the epithelium or the ablated stroma. The oxygen permeability and corresponding Dk of the covering can exceed 350, for example 400 or even 500 or more, so as to inhibit or minimize pain and swelling when the epithelium regenerates.</p>
