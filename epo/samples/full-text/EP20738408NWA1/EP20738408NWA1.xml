The elements or features may be considered selective unless otherwise mentioned. Each element or feature may be practiced without being combined with other elements or features. Further, various embodiments of the present disclosure may be constructed by combining parts of the elements and/or features. Operation orders described in various embodiments of the present disclosure may be rearranged. Some constructions or elements of any one embodiment may be included in another embodiment and may be replaced with corresponding constructions or features of another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the description of the attached drawings, a detailed description of known procedures or steps of the various embodiments of the present disclosure will be avoided lest it should obscure the subject matter of the various embodiments of the present disclosure. In addition, procedures or steps that could be understood to those skilled in the art will not be described either.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Throughout the specification, when a certain portion "includes" or "comprises" a certain component, this indicates that other components are not excluded and may be further included unless otherwise noted. The terms "unit", "-or/er" and "module" described in the specification indicate a unit for processing at least one function or operation, which may be implemented by hardware, software or a combination thereof. In addition, the terms "a or an", "one", "the" etc. may include a singular representation and a plural representation in the context of the various embodiments of the present disclosure (more particularly, in the context of the following claims) unless indicated otherwise in the specification or unless context clearly indicates otherwise.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, a description is mainly made of a data transmission and reception relationship between a Base Station (BS) and a User Equipment (UE). A BS refers to a terminal node of a network, which directly communicates with a UE. A specific operation described as being performed by the BS may be performed by an upper node of the BS.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">Namely, it is apparent that, in a network comprised of a plurality of network nodes including a BS, various operations performed for communication with a UE may be performed by the BS, or network nodes other than the BS. The term 'BS' may be replaced with a fixed station, a Node B, an evolved Node B (eNode B or eNB), gNode B (gNB), an advanced base station (ABS), an access point, etc.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the term terminal may be replaced with a UE, a mobile station (MS), a subscriber station (SS), a mobile subscriber station (MSS), a mobile terminal, an advanced mobile station (AMS), etc.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">A transmission end is a fixed and/or mobile node that provides a data service or a voice service and a reception end is a fixed and/or mobile node that receives a data service or a voice service. Therefore, a UE may serve as a transmission end and a BS may serve as a reception end, on an uplink (UL). Likewise, the UE may serve as a reception end and the BS may serve as a transmission end, on a downlink (DL).</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The various embodiments of the present disclosure may be supported by standard specifications disclosed for at least one of wireless access systems including an institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 802.xx system, a 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) system, a 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) system, 3GPP 5G NR system and a 3GPP2 system.

The detailed description, which will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings, is intended to explain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, rather than to show the only embodiments that can be implemented according to the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The following detailed description includes specific terms in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the specific terms may be replaced with other terms without departing the technical spirit and scope of the various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Hereinafter, 3GPP LTE/LTE-A systems and 3GPP NR system are explained, which are examples of wireless access systems.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The various embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to various wireless access systems such as code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), etc.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">CDMA may be implemented as a radio technology such as universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA) or CDMA2000. TDMA may be implemented as a radio technology such as global system for mobile communications (GSM)/general packet radio service (GPRS)/enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE). OFDMA may be implemented as a radio technology such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), etc.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">UTRA is a part of universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). 3GPP LTE is a part of evolved UMTS (E-UMTS) using E-UTRA, adopting OFDMA for DL and SC-FDMA for UL. LTE-advanced (LTE-A) is an evolution of 3GPP LTE.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">While the various embodiments of the present disclosure are described in the context of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A systems and 3GPP NR system in order to clarify the technical features of the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the various embodiments of the present disclosure is also applicable to an IEEE 802.16e/m system, etc.</p>

<heading id="h0010"><b>1.1. Physical Channels and General Signal Transmission</b></heading>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">In a wireless access system, a UE receives information from a base station on a DL and transmits information to the base station on a UL. The information transmitted and received<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> between the UE and the base station includes general data information and various types of control information. There are many physical channels according to the types/usages of information transmitted and received between the base station and the UE.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating physical channels and a signal transmission method using the physical channels, which may be used in various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">When a UE is powered on or enters a new cell, the UE performs initial cell search (S11). The initial cell search involves acquisition of synchronization to a BS. Specifically, the UE synchronizes its timing to the base station and acquires information such as a cell identifier (ID) by receiving a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) and a secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH) from the BS.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Then the UE may acquire information broadcast in the cell by receiving a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) from the base station.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">During the initial cell search, the UE may monitor a DL channel state by receiving a downlink reference signal (DL RS).</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">After the initial cell search, the UE may acquire more detailed system information by receiving a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and receiving on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) based on information of the PDCCH (S12).</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">Subsequently, to complete connection to the eNB, the UE may perform a random access procedure with the eNB (S13 to S16). In the random access procedure, the UE may transmit a preamble on a physical random access channel (PRACH) (S13) and may receive a PDCCH and a random access response (RAR) for the preamble on a PDSCH associated with the PDCCH (S14). The UE may transmit a PUSCH by using scheduling information in the RAR (S15), and perform a contention resolution procedure including reception of a PDCCH signal and a PDSCH signal corresponding to the PDCCH signal (S16).</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">When the random access procedure is performed in two steps, steps S13 and S15 may be performed in one operation for a UE transmission, and steps S14 and S16 may be performed in one operation for a BS transmission.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">After the above procedure, the UE may receive a PDCCH and/or a PDSCH from the BS (S17) and transmit a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) and/or a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) to the BS (S18), in a general UL/DL signal transmission procedure.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">Control information that the UE transmits to the BS is generically called uplink control information (UCI). The UCI includes a hybrid automatic repeat and request acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK/NACK), a scheduling request (SR), a channel quality indicator (CQI), a precoding matrix index (PMI), a rank indicator (RI), etc.</p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">In general, UCI is transmitted periodically on a PUCCH. However, if control information and traffic data should be transmitted simultaneously, the control information and traffic data may be transmitted on a PUSCH. In addition, the UCI may be transmitted aperiodically on the PUSCH, upon receipt of a request/command from a network.</p>

<p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0003">3</figref> illustrate radio frame structures in an LTE system to which various embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The LTE system supports frame structure type 1 for frequency division duplex (FDD), frame structure type 2 for time division duplex (TDD), and frame structure type 3 for an unlicensed cell (UCell). In the LTE system, up to 31 secondary cells (SCells) may be aggregated in addition to a primary cell (PCell). Unless otherwise specified, the following operation may be applied independently on a cell basis.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">In multi-cell aggregation, different frame structures may be used for different cells. Further, time resources (e.g., a subframe, a slot, and a subslot) within a frame structure may be generically referred to as a time unit (TU).</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref> illustrates frame structure type 1. Frame type 1 is applicable to both a full Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system and a half FDD system.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">A DL radio frame is defined by 10 1-ms subframes. A subframe includes 14 or 12 symbols according to a cyclic prefix (CP). In a normal CP case, a subframe includes 14 symbols, and in an extended CP case, a subframe includes 12 symbols.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">Depending on multiple access schemes, a symbol may be an OFDM(A) symbol or an SC-FDM(A) symbol. For example, a symbol may refer to an OFDM(A) symbol on DL and an SC-FDM(A) symbol on UL. An OFDM(A) symbol may be referred to as a cyclic prefix-OFDMA(A) (CP-OFDM(A)) symbol, and an SC-FMD(A) symbol may be referred to as a discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM(A) (DFT-s-OFDM(A)) symbol.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">One subframe may be defined by one or more slots according to a subcarrier spacing (SCS) as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> -->
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>When SCS = 7.5kHz or 15kHz, subframe #i is defined by two 0.5-ms slots, slot #2i and slot #2i+1 (i = 0∼9).</li>
<li>When SCS = 1.25kHz, subframe #i is defined by one 1-ms slot, slot #2i.</li>
<li>When SCS = 15kHz, subframe #i may be defined by six subslots as illustrated in Table 1.</li>

A symbol may refer to a symbol duration. A slot structure may be described by a resource grid including N<sup>DL/UL</sup><sub>RB</sub>N<sup>RB</sup><sub>sc</sub> subcarriers and N<sup>DL/UL</sup>symb symbols. N<sup>DL</sup><sub>RB</sub> represents the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> number of RBs in a DL slot, and N<sup>UL</sup><sub>RB</sub> represents the number of RBs in a UL slot. N<sup>DL</sup><sub>RB</sub> and N<sup>UL</sup><sub>RB</sub> are dependent on a DL bandwidth and a UL bandwidth, respectively. N<sup>DL</sup><sub>symb</sub> represents the number of symbols in the DL slot, and N<sup>UL</sup><sub>symb</sub> represents the number of symbols in the UL slot. N<sup>RB</sup><sub>sc</sub> represents the number of subcarriers in one RB. The number of symbols in a slot may vary according to an SCS and a CP length (see Table 1).

<heading id="h0021"><b>1.6. Dynamic Slot Format Indication Information (e.g., DCI format 2_0)</b></heading>
<p id="p0234" num="0234">Basically, a slot format indicates the usage of each symbol in a slot. The slot format indicates each symbol as DL (D), UL (U), or flexible (F). Slot format-related information may be transmitted in one or more of the following signals:
<ul id="ul0022" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>a static or semi-static slot format indication (SFI) (e.g., <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon</i> and/or <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated</i>) by higher-layer signaling</li>
<li>a measurement-related scheduling signal (e.g., a measurement-related signal configured by UE-specific RRC signaling)</li>
<li>a dynamic SFI (e.g., a signal transmitted in DCI format 2_0)</li>
<li>a UE-specific data transmission scheduling signal (e.g., UE-specific DCI)</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0235" num="0235">The static or semi-static SFI may be indicated by cell-specific RRC signaling (e.g., <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon</i>) or UE-specific RRC signaling (e.g., <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated</i>). The measurement-related signal may be indicated by UE-specific RRC signaling, and the corresponding signal may indicate a periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS, a periodic CSI report, a periodic/semi-persistent SRS, or the like. The UE-specific data transmission-related signal may include UE-specific DCI that triggers a PUCCH along with an A/N for a PDSCH, a PUSCH, or a PDSCH, and DCI that triggers an aperiodic measurement-related signal such as an aperiodic CSI-RS, an aperiodic SRS, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0236" num="0236"><figref idref="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating exemplary slot formats according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.

<p id="p0237" num="0237">The slot formats include a format for zero, one or two switching points. FIG. C5 illustrates various exemplary slot formats. Specifically, <figref idref="f0013">FIG. 13(a)</figref> illustrates an exemplary slot format for zero switching point, <figref idref="f0013">FIG. 13(b)</figref> illustrates an exemplary slot format for one switching point, and <figref idref="f0013">FIG. 13(c)</figref> illustrates an exemplary slot format for two switching points.</p>
<p id="p0238" num="0238">The slot format for zero switching point includes 14 DL symbols, 14 flexible symbols, or 14 UL symbols. The slot format for one switching point is configured to start with zero or more DL symbols and end with zero or more UL symbols, with one or more flexible symbols and DL/UL<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> symbols in between. The slot format for two switching points is configured to include first 7 symbols starting with zero or more DL symbols and ending with one or more UL symbols in a 7<sup>th</sup> symbol, and second 7 symbols starting with one or more DL symbols and ending with zero or more UL symbols. Each of the sets of the first 7 symbols and the second 7 symbols may include zero or more flexible symbols.</p>
<p id="p0239" num="0239">Up to 256 such slot formats may be defined, and their configurations are defined in the technical specification TS 38.211 and so on. The UE is configured with a UE-specific SFI table based on the up to 256 slot formats by higher-layer signaling, and receives a specific index value of the UE-specific SFI table in DCI format 2_0 (or a GC-PDCCH).</p>
<p id="p0240" num="0240">The UE determines a slot format based on the following prioritization for signals carrying the above-described slot format-related information. More specifically, when the UE receives slot format-related information in a plurality of signals, the UE considers indication information of signals with the following priority only to identify the usage of a symbol indicated as flexible by a high-priority signal.</p>
<p id="p0241" num="0241">Slot format information by cell-specific higher-layer signaling (e.g., <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon</i>) &gt; slot format information by UE-specific higher-layer signaling (e.g., <i>TDD-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated</i>) &gt; slot format information by a GC-PDCCH (e.g., DCI format 2_0) &gt; UE-specific data transmission scheduling information &gt; measurement-related scheduling information</p>
<p id="p0242" num="0242">Therefore, when a specific symbol in a slot is indicated to the UE as DL/UL by cell-specific RRC signaling or UE-specific RRC signaling, the UE does not expect DCI format 2_0 (or a group-specific PDCCH including DCI format 2_0) to indicate the specific symbol as UL/DL or flexible. When a specific symbol in a slot is indicated as flexible by DCI format 2_0 (or a group-specific PDCCH including DCI format 2_0), the UE transmits and receives a related signal in the specific symbol only when separately receiving scheduling information (e.g., UE-specific scheduling DCI). When the UE does not receive the scheduling information separately, the UE does not transmit/receive a signal in the specific symbol.</p>

<heading id="h0026"><b>2.2 Overview of Channel Access Procedures (CAPs)</b></heading>
<p id="p0268" num="0268">Unless otherwise noted, the definitions below are applicable for the following terminologies used in the present disclosure.<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> -->
<ul id="ul0023" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>A channel refers to a carrier or a part of a carrier composed of a contiguous set of RBs in which a CAP is performed in a shared spectrum.</li>
<li>A channel access procedure (CAP) may be a procedure based on sensing that evaluates the availability of a channel for performing transmissions. A basic unit for sensing is a sensing slot with a duration of T<sub>s1</sub>= 9us. The sensing slot duration may be considered to be idle if an eNB/gNB or a UE senses the channel during the sensing slot duration, and determines that the detected power for at least 4us within the sensing slot duration is less than an energy detection threshold X<sub>Thresh</sub>. Otherwise, the sensing slot duration T<sub>s1</sub> may be considered to be busy.</li>
<li>Channel occupancy refers to transmission(s) on channel(s) by eNB/gNB/UE(s) after performing a corresponding CAP in this subclause.</li>
<li>A channel occupancy time (COT) refers to the total time for which eNB/gNB/UE(s) and any eNB/gNB/UE(s) sharing the channel occupancy perform transmission(s) on a channel after an eNB/gNB/UE performs the corresponding CAPs described in this subclause. For determining a COT, if a transmission gap is less than or equal to 25us, the gap duration may be counted in the COT. The COT may be shared for transmission between an eNB/gNB and corresponding UE(s).</li>
<li>A DL transmission burst is defined as a set of transmissions from an eNB/gNB without any gaps greater than 16us. Transmissions from an eNB/gNB separated by a gap of more than 16us are considered as separate DL transmission bursts. An eNB/gNB may transmit transmission(s) after a gap within a DL transmission burst without sensing the corresponding channel(s) for availability.</li>
<li><i>A</i> UL transmission burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a UE without any gap greater than 16us. Transmissions from a UE separated by a gap of more than 16us are considered as separate UL transmission bursts. A UE may transmit transmission(s) after a gap within a UL transmission burst without sensing the corresponding channel(s) for availability.</li>
<li>A discovery burst refers to a DL transmission burst including a set of signal(s) and/or channel(s) confined within a window and associated with a duty cycle. The discovery burst may be any of the following:
<ul id="ul0024" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>- - Transmission(s) initiated by an eNB that includes a primary synchronization signal (PSS), secondary synchronization signal (SSS) and cell-specific reference signal(s)(CRS) and may include non-zero power CSI-RS.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --></li>
<li>- - Transmission(s) initiated by a gNB that includes at least an SS/PBCH block and may also include a CORESET for a PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH with SIB1, and a PDSCH carrying SIB1 and/or non-zero power CS-RS. The SS/PBCH block may include a PSS, a SSS, and a PBCH with an associated demodulation reference signal (DM-RS).</li>

On the assumption that a PCell being a licensed band and one or more SCells being an unlicensed band are basically configured for the BS, the following description is given of DL CAPs to which various embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable, in which an unlicensed band is referred to as a licensed assisted access (LAA) SCell. However, the DL CAPs may also be applied in the same manner, when only an unlicensed band is configured for the BS.</p>
<heading id="h0028">2.3.1. Type 1 DL channel access procedures</heading>
<p id="p0270" num="0270">This subclause describes CAPs to be performed by a BS for which a time duration spanned by sensing slots that are sensed to be idle before DL transmission(s) is random. This subclause is applicable to the following transmissions:

<p id="p0272" num="0272"><figref idref="f0020">FIG. 20</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a DL CAP for transmission in an unlicensed band, to which various embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable.</p>
<p id="p0273" num="0273">The afore-described Type 1 DL CAP may be summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p0274" num="0274">For a DL transmission, a transmission node (e.g., a BS) may initiate a CAP (2010).</p>
<p id="p0275" num="0275">The BS may randomly select a backoff counter N within a contention window (CW) according to step 1. N is set to an initial value N<sub>init</sub> (2020). N<sub>init</sub> is a random value selected between 0 and CW<sub>p</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0276" num="0276">Subsequently, when the backoff counter value N is 0 according to step 4 (2030; Y), the BS terminates the CAP (2032). The BS may then perform a Tx burst transmission (2034). On the contrary, when the backoff counter value N is not 0 (2030; N), the BS decrements the backoff counter value by 1 according to step 2 (2040).</p>
<p id="p0277" num="0277">Subsequently, the BS checks whether the channel is idle (2050). If the channel is idle (2050; Y), the BS determines whether the backoff counter value is 0 (2030).</p>
<p id="p0278" num="0278">On the contrary, when the channel is not idle, that is, the channel is busy in operation 2050 (2050; N), the BS determines whether the channel is idle during a longer defer duration T<sub>d</sub> (25usec or longer) than a sensing slot duration (e.g., 9usec) (2060). If the channel is idle during the defer duration (2070; Y), the BS may resume the CAP.</p>
<p id="p0279" num="0279">For example, when the backoff counter value N<sub>init</sub> is 10 and the channel is determined to be idle after the backoff counter value is decremented to 5, the BS senses the channel during the defer duration and determines whether the channel is idle. If the channel is idle during the defer duration, the BS may resume the CAP from the backoff counter value 5 (or from the backoff counter value 4 obtained by decrementing the backoff counter value 5 by 1), instead of setting the backoff counter value N<sub>init</sub>.<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --></p>
<p id="p0280" num="0280">On the other hand, when the channel is busy during the defer duration (2070; N), the BS determines again whether the channel is idle during a new defer duration by performing step 2060 again.</p>
<p id="p0281" num="0281">If the BS has not performed a transmission after step 4 in the above procedure, the BS may perform a transmission on the channel, if the following condition is satisfied:</p>
<p id="p0282" num="0282">if the BS is ready to transmit and the channel is sensed to be idle at least in a sensing slot duration T<sub>s1</sub>, and if the channel has been sensed to be idle during all the sensing slot durations of a defer duration T<sub>d</sub> immediately before this transmission.</p>
<p id="p0283" num="0283">On the contrary, if the channel has not been sensed to be idle in the sensing slot duration T<sub>s1</sub> when the BS first senses the channel after it is ready to transmit or if the channel has not been sensed to be idle during any of the sensing slot durations of the defer duration T<sub>d</sub> immediately before this intended transmission, the BS proceeds to step 1 after sensing the channel to be idle during the sensing slot durations of the defer duration T<sub>s1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0284" num="0284">The defer duration T<sub>d</sub> includes a duration T<sub>f</sub> (=16us) immediately followed by m<sub>p</sub> consecutive sensing slot durations. Each sensing slot duration T<sub>s1</sub> is 9us and the duration T<sub>f</sub> includes an idle sensing slot duration T<sub>s1</sub> at the start of the duration T<sub>f</sub>.</p>

<p id="p0352" num="0352">The afore-described Type 1 UL CAP of a UE may be summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p0353" num="0353">For a UL transmission, a transmission node (e.g., a UE) may initiate a CAP to operate in an unlicensed band (2110).</p>
<p id="p0354" num="0354">The UE may select a backoff counter N randomly within a CW according to step 1. N is set to an initial value N<sub>init</sub> (2120). N<sub>init</sub> is a value randomly selected between 0 and CW<sub>p</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0355" num="0355">Subsequently, when the backoff counter value N is 0 according to step 4 (2130; Y), the UE ends the CAP (2132). The UE may then transmit a Tx burst (2134). On the other hand, if the backoff counter value is not 0 (2130; N), the UE decrements the backoff counter value by 1 according to step 2 (2140).<!-- EPO <DP n="71"> --></p>
<p id="p0356" num="0356">Subsequently, the UE checks whether a channel is idle (2150). If the channel is idle (2150; Y), the UE checks whether the backoff counter value is 0 (2130).</p>
<p id="p0357" num="0357">On the contrary, if the channel is not idle, that is, the channel is busy (2150; N), the UE checks whether the channel is idle for a defer duration T<sub>d</sub> (of 25usec or more) longer than a slot duration (e.g., 9usec) according to step 5 (2160). If the channel is idle for the defer duration (2170; Y), the UE may resume the CAP.</p>
<p id="p0358" num="0358">For example, if the backoff counter value N<sub>init</sub> is 10 and the channel is determined to be idle after the backoff counter value is decremented to 5, the UE senses the channel for the defer duration and determines whether the channel is idle. If the channel is idle for the defer duration, the UE may perform the CAP again from the backoff counter value 5 (or the backoff counter value 4 after decrementing the backoff counter value by 1), instead of setting the backoff counter value N<sub>init</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0359" num="0359">On the other hand, if the channel is busy for the defer duration (2170; N), the UE checks again whether the channel is idle for a new defer duration by performing operation 2160 again.</p>

<p id="p0390" num="0390">As more and more communication devices require larger communication capacities, efficient use of a limited frequency band becomes a significant requirement. In this context, techniques of using an unlicensed band such as 2.4GHz mainly used in the legacy WiFi system or 5GHz and/or 60GHz which has newly attracted attention are under consideration for a cellular communication system such as 3GPP LTE/NR. Hereinbelow, the term unlicensed band may be replaced with unlicensed spectrum or shared spectrum.<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --></p>
<p id="p0391" num="0391">To transmit a signal in an unlicensed band, a UE or a BS uses wireless transmission and reception based on contention between communication nodes. That is, when each communication node is to transmit a signal in the unlicensed band, the communication node may confirm that another communication node is not transmitting a signal in the unlicensed band by performing channel sensing before the signal transmission. For the convenience of description, this operation is defined as a listen before talk (LBT) operation or a CAP. Particularly, the operation of checking whether another communication node is transmitting a signal is defined as carrier sensing (CS), and determining that another communication node is not transmitting a signal is defined as confirming clear channel assessment (CCA).</p>
<p id="p0392" num="0392">In an LTE/NR system to which various embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable, an eNB/gNB or a UE may also have to perform an LBT operation or a CAP for signal transmission in an unlicensed band. In other words, the eNB/gNB or the UE may transmit a signal in the unlicensed band, using or based on the CAP.</p>
<p id="p0393" num="0393">Further, when the eNB/gNB or the UE transmits a signal in the unlicensed band, other communication nodes such as WiFi nodes should not interfere with the eNB/gNB or the UE by performing a CAP. For example, the WiFi standard (e.g., 801.11ac) specifies a CCA threshold as -62dBm for a non-WiFi signal and as -82dBm for a WiFi signal. Accordingly, a station (STA) or access point (AP) operating in conformance to the WiFi standard may not transmit a signal to prevent interference, for example, when receiving a signal other than a WiFi signal at or above - 62dBm.</p>
<p id="p0394" num="0394">In the following description of various embodiments of the present disclosure, when it is said that a BS succeeds in a CAP, this may imply that the BS determines that an unlicensed band is idle and thus starts to transmit a signal in the unlicensed band at a specific time. On the contrary, when it is said that the BS fails in the CAP, this may imply that the BS determines that the unlicensed band is busy and thus does not start to transmit a signal in the unlicensed band at a specific time.</p>
<p id="p0395" num="0395">For co-existence with a WiFi system in which a CAP is performed in units of 20MHz, a carrier bandwidth is basically limited to 20MHz in an LTE LAA system. However, the carrier bandwidth may vary according to SCSs in the NR system. Thus, the carrier bandwidth may be larger than 20MHz. Further, the UE may be configured with a BWP narrower than the carrier bandwidth operated by the gNB. The same thing may be applied to an NR-unlicensed band (NR-U)<!-- EPO <DP n="80"> --> system. In consideration of a frequency unit in which the CAP is performed in the WiFi system, the carrier bandwidth may be set to a multiple of 20MHz in the NR-U system.</p>
<p id="p0396" num="0396">Accordingly, 20 MHz has a meaning as a frequency unit in which the CAP is performed, and it will be clearly understood to those skilled in the art that various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the specific frequency value of 20MHz.</p>
<p id="p0397" num="0397">Meanwhile, the above-described carrier bandwidth may be understood as a wideband, and a frequency unit in which the CAP is performed may be understood as a CAP subband and/or a CAP (LBT) bandwidth and/or a channel. The CAP subband and/or LBT bandwidth and/or channel is a carrier including a set of contiguous RBs in which the CAP is performed within an unlicensed band (and/or a shared spectrum) or a part of the carrier.</p>
<p id="p0398" num="0398">When consecutive transmissions without a gap on the time axis or a set of transmissions without a gap greater than a predetermined size (e.g., 16us) on the time axis from one transmission node (a gNB and/or a UE) is referred to as a burst or a Tx burst) in an unlicensed-band NR system, various embodiments of the present disclosure described below may be related to methods of transmitting and receiving an initial signal to indicate a burst transmission and enable the burst transmission to be recognized, a PDCCH monitoring method, and a cross-carrier scheduling (CCS) method.</p>
<p id="p0399" num="0399">In the NR system, for example, a scheduling unit is a slot and a time-domain structure which also allows only a part of a slot to be filled for transmission (mini-slot transmission) may be supported. For example, this may be a time-domain structure considered to support an unlicensed band.</p>
<p id="p0400" num="0400">Accordingly, considering the time-domain structure of the NR system, while the following description is given of various embodiments of the present disclosure, focusing on operations in an unlicensed band (and an NR system operating in the unlicensed band), those skilled in the art will understand that various embodiments of the present disclosure are also readily applicable to a licensed band (and an NR system operating in the licensed band).</p>

Those skilled in the art will understand that the various embodiments of the present disclosure described below may be combined in whole or in part to constitute other various embodiments of the present disclosure, unless contradicting with each other.</p>

<p id="p0402" num="0402"><figref idref="f0023">FIG. 23</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary method of transmitting and receiving an initial signal according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0403" num="0403">Referring to <figref idref="f0023">FIG. 23</figref>, in operation 2301 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a BS may perform a DL CAP for an unlicensed band to transmit a DL signal to a UE. For example, the DL CAP may be one or more of the afore-described various DL CAPs for DL transmission.</p>
<p id="p0404" num="0404">In operation 2303 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, when the BS determines that the unlicensed band is available (or a channel configured in the unlicensed band is idle) by the DL CAP, the BS may transmit an initial signal and/or a DL signal in the unlicensed band (or on the channel configured in the unlicensed band) to the UE based on a method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0405" num="0405">Accordingly, for example, the UE may expect the BS to transmit the DL signal based on the initial signal received earlier than the DL signal. Thus, the UE may receive the DL signal from the BS.</p>
<p id="p0406" num="0406">For example, the UE may transmit or receive a signal associated with the received DL signal to or from the BS. For example, when the UE is to transmit a specific signal to the BS, the UE may transmit the specific signal to the BS based on the result of a UL CAP. For example, the UL CAP may be one or more of the afore-described various UL CAPs for UL transmission.</p>
<p id="p0407" num="0407">In the descriptions of this subclause and various embodiments of the present disclosure, determination of the inside/outside of a COT may refer to acquisition/transmission of a DL burst based on a DL signal and/or a PDCCH as in [Method #1-1A], [Method #1-2A], [Method #1-1B], and [Method #1-2B] described below.</p>
<p id="p0408" num="0408">Information elements (IEs) described in this subclause and various embodiments of the present disclosure may be defined as follows.</p>
<p id="p0409" num="0409">For example, <i>recoderGranularity</i> is an IE included in an RRC parameter <i>ControlResourceSet</i> used to configure a time and/or frequency CORESET for DCI detection. For example, this IE may provide information about a precoder granularity on the frequency axis.</p>
<p id="p0410" num="0410">For example, <i>recoderGranularity</i> may be set to one of <i>sameASREG-bundle</i> and <i>allContiguousRBs</i> (ENUMERATED {sameAsREG-bundle, allContiguousRBs}).</p>
<p id="p0411" num="0411">For example, <i>sameAsREG-bundle</i> may be information indicating that a frequency-domain precoder granularity for each CORESET is equal to a frequency-domain REG bundle size.<!-- EPO <DP n="82"> --></p>
<p id="p0412" num="0412">For example, <i>allContiguousRBs</i> may be information indicating that a frequency-domain precoder granularity for each CORESET is equal to the number of frequency-domain contiguous RBs in the CORESET.</p>
<p id="p0413" num="0413">For example, <i>pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID</i> is an IE included in the RRC parameter <i>ControlResourceSet</i> used to configure a time and/or frequency CORESET for DCI detection. <i>pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID</i> may be an RRC parameter for PDCCH DMRS scrambling initialization.</p>
<p id="p0414" num="0414">For example, <i>searchSpaceType</i> may be an IE included in an RRC parameter <i>SearchSpace</i> defining how and/or where a PDCCH (PDCCH candidates) is to be detected, and each search space may be associated with one <i>ControlResourceSet.</i></p>
<p id="p0415" num="0415">For example, <i>searchSpaceType</i> may be an RRC parameter indicating a CSS and/or a USS and/or a DCI format for monitoring.</p>
<p id="p0416" num="0416">For example, <i>frequencyDomainResources</i> may be an IE included in the RRC parameter <i>ControlResourceSet.</i></p>
<p id="p0417" num="0417">For example, <i>frequencyDomainResources</i> may provide information about the frequency-domain resources of the CORESET.</p>
<p id="p0418" num="0418">Now, a description will be given of a specific operation of a UE and/or a BS based on an initial signal transmission and reception method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0419" num="0419">For example, when transmission data is generated or a signal/channel such as an RS for measurement requires periodic transmissions in a licensed channel/carrier at the BS, it may be guaranteed that the transmission starts at an intended time.</p>
<p id="p0420" num="0420">On the other hand, even though the BS is to transmit a DL signal at a specific time in an unlicensed channel/carrier, the BS may not start the transmission when the BS fails in a CAP immediately before the specific time. That is, the BS may or may not transmit a signal in the unlicensed channel/carrier depending on whether the BS succeeds in the CAP. Therefore, the UE needs to identify when the BS starts a transmission, and thus requires a signal indicating whether a DL transmission is actually performed. This signal indicating whether a DL transmission is actually performed may be referred to as an initial signal.</p>
<p id="p0421" num="0421">For example, the initial signal may be transmitted at the start of a Tx burst.<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --></p>
<p id="p0422" num="0422">In another example, the initial signal may be transmitted in every specific time unit of the Tx burst (per specific time unit, for example, per slot boundary in the Tx burst).</p>
<p id="p0423" num="0423">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the initial signal may be transmitted in the unlicensed channel/carrier at least for the following purposes.
<ol id="ol0008" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1&gt; For example, to receive DCI in a Tx burst from a serving cell and receive a PDSCH scheduled by the DCI.</li>
<li>2&gt; For example, to perform CSI measurement in a CSI-RS transmitted in a Tx burst from a serving cell.</li>
<li>3&gt; For example, to perform RRM measurement in signals of a Tx burst from a serving cell/neighbor cell.</li>
<li>4&gt; For example, for automatic gain control (AGC) gain setting: for example, the initial signal may be used to set AGC for receiving a burst transmitted after the initial signal.</li>
<li>5&gt; For example, (coarse or fine) time and/or frequency synchronization: for example, the initial signal may be used for accurate time and/or frequency synchronization between signals (for RRM or CSI measurement) to be transmitted periodically. Alternatively, for example, the initial signal may be used to detect a frame/subframe/slot/symbol boundary. Alternatively, for example, an NR node may usually attempt to discover/detect the initial signal without FFT, and only when discovering/detecting the initial signal, may perform FFT. In this case, there may be a gain in terms of battery saving.</li>
<li>6&gt; For example, for power saving: for example, the UE does not perform or performs minimally a DL reception operation such as PDCCH monitoring until before discovering/detecting the initial signal. Upon discovery of the initial signal, the UE is allowed to start the DL reception operation such as PDCCH monitoring. Therefore, power consumption of the UE may be reduced.</li>

<li>PSS and/or SSS and/or PBCH DM-RS: In an exemplary embodiment, a PSS and/or an SSS and/or a PBCH DM-RS defined in NR may be modified and repeated along the time axis and/or may be extended along the frequency axis. Thus, tracking performance may be secured or transmission power may be increased.</li>
<li>PDCCH DM-RS: In an exemplary embodiment, the constraint that the DM-RS includes only one symbol to minimize time-axis occupation may be imposed.
<ul id="ul0060" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>- - In an exemplary embodiment, the DM-RS may be a separate (PDCCH) DM-RS which is not linked to a specific CORESET. In this case, for example, the DM-RS may be configured to occupy a frequency band made up of a specific number of or more RBs (e.g., 50 RBs) in consideration of the tracking performance and/or transmission power of the DM-RS. For example, a transmission periodicity (e.g., 7 symbols (7-symbol periodicity)) may be additionally configured.</li>
<li>- - In an exemplary embodiment, the DM-RS may be a (PDCCH) DM-RS linked to a specific CORESET. For example, in this case, the DM-RS may be configured to occupy a frequency band made up of a specific number of or more RBs (e.g., 50 RBs) in consideration of the tracking performance and/or transmission power of the DM-RS, and may be transmitted in a specific REG or total REGs of the CORESET irrespective of a PDCCH transmission. In another example, characteristically, the DM-RS may be a DM-RS corresponding to a CORESET for which <i>recoderGranularity</i> is set to <i>allContiguousRBs.</i> For example, when <i>recoderGranularity</i> is set to <i>allContiguousRBs</i> in the NR system, the UE may assume that the DM-RS exists in every REG in contiguous RBs including REGs in mapped (or discovered) PDCCH candidates. On the other hand, for example, the UE may assume that the DM-RS exists in all REGs (or some REG(s)) of the CORESET irrespective of the mapped (or discovered) PDCCH candidates.</li>
<li>- - In an exemplary embodiment, the UE may be configured with a specific PDCCH DM-RS as an initial signal by the BS. In another example, when the UE is configured with a PDCCH DM-RS associated with a CORESET satisfying a specific condition, the UE may determine the PDCCH DM-RS as an initial signal. For example, the CORESET satisfying the specific condition may be determined by parameters such as a specific CORESET index (e.g., the lowest index or the highest index larger than 0 among CORESET indexes configured for an active<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --> DL BWP) and/or <i>pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID</i> (e.g., when it is set only by a function of cell-specific information such as a cell ID) and/or <i>recoderGranularity</i> (e.g., when it is set to <i>allContiguousRBs</i>) and/or duration information (e.g., when it is set to a 1-symbol duration) and/or <i>frequencyDomainResources</i> (e.g., when it indicates a predetermined number of or more RBs). For example, a CORESET associated with CORESET index 0 and/or a CORSET associated with a DM-RS with <i>pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID</i> configured only by a function of cell-specific information may be the CORESET satisfying the specific condition. For example, PDCCHs configured to be monitored in a search space set associated with the CORESET satisfying the specific condition may be defined/configured as initial signals. For example, a PDCCH DM-RS in every search space set (or search space, this may also be applied to this subclause and various embodiments of the present disclosure) associated with the CORESET may be configured as an initial signal. In another example, for a search space set satisfying a specific condition (e.g., the index of a specific search space set such as the lowest of CORESET indexes configured for an active DL BWP and/or a monitoring occasion interval of k or fewer slots/symbols and/or a specific aggregation level and/or a CSS and/or a specific DCI format such as DCI format 2_0 and/or configuration of a CORESET at a specific symbol position in a slot) among search space sets associated with the CORESET, a PDCCH DM-RS in a CORESET associated with the search space set may be configured as an initial signal. In another example, when the PDCCH DM-RS in the CORESET associated with the search space set satisfying the specific condition is configured, the UE may determine the PDCCH DM-RS as an initial signal. For example, the search space set satisfying the specific condition may be determined by parameters such as a specific search space set index (e.g., the lowest index or the lowest index larger than 0, among search space set indexes configured for an active DL BWP) and/or a monitoring occasion interval (e.g., k or fewer slots/symbols) and/or an aggregation level (e.g., including a specific aggregation level such as AL=16) and/or <i>searchSpaceType</i> (e.g., CSS type) and/or a configuration for a specific DCI format (e.g., DCI format 2_0/1/2/3 and/or a DCI format indicating a COT structure) and/or a monitoring symbol index in a slot (e.g., symbol 0, symbol 7, or the like). In another example, when a PDCCH DM-RS in a CORESET satisfying a specific condition among CORESETs associated with search space sets satisfying a specific condition is configured, the UE may determine the PDCCH DM-RS as an initial signal.</li>

<li>CSI-RS (channel state information-reference signal): In an exemplary embodiment, the UE may be configured with a specific CSI-RS as an initial signal by the BS. In another example, when a CSI-RS satisfying a specific condition is configured, the UE may determine the CSI-RS as an initial signal. For example, the CSI-RS satisfying the specific condition may be determined by a configuration such as a configured usage (e.g., tracking and/or RRM measurement and/or CSI acquisition/obtaining and/or beam management) and/or a frequency band (e.g., a specific number of or more RBs) and/or a monitoring occasion interval (e.g., equal to or less than k slots/symbols) and/or a parameter involved in a sequence initialization signal (e.g., set by a function of only a cell-specific parameter such as a cell ID irrespective of a UE-specific parameter).</li>

<p id="p0510" num="0510"><figref idref="f0027">FIG. 27</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary method of transmitting and receiving a PDCCH according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0511" num="0511">Referring to <figref idref="f0027">FIG. 27</figref>, in operation 2701 according to an exemplary embodiment, a BS may perform a DL cap for an unlicensed band to transmit a DL signal/channel such as a PDCCH to a UE. For example, the DL CAP may be one or more of the afore-described various DL CAPs for DL transmission.</p>
<p id="p0512" num="0512">In operation 2703 according to an exemplary embodiment, when the BS determines from the DL CAP that the unlicensed band is available (or a channel configured in the unlicensed band is idle), the BS may transmit a PDCCH to the UE in the unlicensed band (or on the channel configured in the unlicensed band) based on a method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0513" num="0513">For example, a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance for the UE may be determined based on a later-described method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In operation 2705 according to an exemplary embodiment, the UE may monitor and/or decode the PDCCH received form the BS based on the determined PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance.</p>
<p id="p0514" num="0514">For example, the UE may transmit and receive a signal scheduled by the received PDCCH (e.g., DCI) to and from the BS. For example, when the UE is to transmit a specific signal to the BS, the UE may transmit the specific signal based on the result of a UL CAP. For example, the UL CAP may be one or more of the afore-described various UL CAPs for UL transmission.<!-- EPO <DP n="98"> --></p>
<p id="p0515" num="0515">For example, in operation 2703 according to the above-described exemplary embodiment, the BS may transmit the PDCCH to the UE in consideration of the PDCCH monitoring periodicity for the UE.</p>
<p id="p0516" num="0516">Now, a description will be given of a specific operation of a UE and/or a BS based on a PDCCH transmission and reception method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0517" num="0517">For example, a time when the BS succeeds in a CAP may not be predicted. Therefore, it may be favorable in terms of efficient channel occupancy to set a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval to be very short.</p>
<p id="p0518" num="0518">On the contrary, for example, because setting of a short PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval may result in great power consumption of the UE for PDCCH monitoring, it may be favorable in terms of power consumption of the UE to set a relatively long PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval.</p>

<p id="p0521" num="0521">For example, when the first slot of a DL COT is too short, it may be very difficult to control a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval immediately starting in the following slot (or after K slots), in terms of UE implementation (e.g., in terms of a processing time of the UE).</p>
<p id="p0522" num="0522">In this regard, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, when the length of the first slot of a DL COT is equal to or less than or less than N symbols (e.g., N=3), the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring with a (PDCCH monitoring) periodicity applied<!-- EPO <DP n="99"> --> to the outside of the DL COT in the slot to the next slot (immediately following the slot) (and/or the following K slots).</p>
<p id="p0523" num="0523">On the contrary, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, when the length of the first slot of the DL COT is equal to or larger than or larger than N symbols (e.g., N=3), the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring with the (PDCCH monitoring) periodicity applied to the outside of the DL COT, only in the slot (and/or the slot to the (immediately) following K-1 slots). For example, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring with a (PDCCH monitoring) periodicity configured for the inside of the DL COT, starting in the next slot (and/or the following K slots).</p>
<p id="p0524" num="0524">For example, the UE may switch to PDCCH monitoring with the (PDCCH monitoring) periodicity configured for the inside of the DL COT, starting in the first of the slots following the corresponding slot (e.g., from the beginning and/or boundary of the first slot).</p>
<p id="p0525" num="0525">For example, the above-described N may be set to a larger value than a processing time of the UE for switching of a PDCCH monitoring operation. For example, N (the number of symbols) may be set to a value equal to or larger than a time taken for the UE to switch the PDCCH monitoring operation.</p>
<p id="p0526" num="0526">In an exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions (and/or CORESETs) are configured in a search space set within a specific slot.</p>
<p id="p0527" num="0527">For example, 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 are set as monitoring symbols (i.e., symbol #0 and symbol #4 and symbol #7 and symbol #11 are configured as monitoring symbols) in a slot of a 1-symbol CORESET, and 0/1 &amp; 4/5 &amp; 7/8 &amp; 11/12 are set as monitoring symbols (i.e., symbol #0/1 and symbol #4/5 and symbol #7/8 and symbol #11/12 are configured as monitoring symbols) in a slot of a 2-symbol CORESET.</p>
<p id="p0528" num="0528">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, based on the assumption, when the length of the first slot of a discovered DL COT is equal to or less than (or less than) 3 symbols, the UE may perform PDCCH reception in multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions (and/or CORESETs) with a configured periodicity (e.g., the periodicity of monitoring symbols in the above 1-symbol/2-symbol CORESET) even a slot in the corresponding slot to the next slot. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the UE may perform PDCCH reception only in the earliest symbol area (and/or CORESET) among multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions (and/or CORESETs) in a slot, starting in the next slot. For example, the PDCCH may<!-- EPO <DP n="100"> --> be received only in the earliest symbol #0 of the monitoring symbols in the slot of the 1-symbol CORESET, and only in the earliest symbol #0/1 of the monitoring symbols in the slot of the 2-symbol CORESET. Accordingly, PDCCH occasions may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p0529" num="0529">On the contrary, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, based on the assumption, when the length of the first slot of a discovered DL COT is larger than (or equal to or larger than) 3 symbols, the UE may perform PDCCH reception in multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions (and/or CORESETs) with a periodicity even within the slot and only for the slot. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the UE may perform PDCCH reception only in the earliest symbol area (and/or CORESET) among multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions (and/or CORESETs) in a slot, starting from the next slot.</p>
<p id="p0530" num="0530">For a 1-symbol CORESET, for example, when the length of the first slot of a discovered DL COT is equal to or less than 3 symbols, the UE may receive a PDCCH based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbols 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 in the corresponding slot to the next slot, and based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbol 0 in slots following the next slot. On the contrary, when the length of the first slot of the discovered DL COT is larger than 3 symbols, the UE may receive a PDCCH based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbols 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 only in the corresponding slot, and based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbol 0 in slots following the slot.</p>
<p id="p0531" num="0531">For a 2-symbol CORESET, for example, when the length of the first slot of a discovered DL COT is equal to or less than 3 symbols, the UE may receive a PDCCH based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbols 0/1 &amp; 4/5 &amp; 7/8 &amp; 11/12 in the corresponding slot to the next slot, and based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbol 0/1 in slots following the next slot. On the contrary, when the length of the first slot of the discovered DL COT is larger than 3 symbols, the UE may receive a PDCCH based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbols 0/1 &amp; 4/5 &amp; 7/8 &amp; 11/12 only in the corresponding slot, and based on PDCCH monitoring in monitoring symbol 0/1 in slots following the slot.</p>
<p id="p0532" num="0532">For example, when monitoring occasions of different periodicities are configured for multiple search space sets, the above-described various embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to specific search space set(s).<!-- EPO <DP n="101"> --></p>
<p id="p0533" num="0533">For example, the above-described various embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to all search space set(s) in which PDCCH monitoring occasions are configured at an interval less than a specific threshold (e.g., one slot) among multiple search space sets.</p>
<p id="p0534" num="0534">For example, it is assumed that PDCCH monitoring is configured at an interval of 2 slots in search space set #0, at an interval of 2 symbols in search space set #1, and at an interval of 7 symbols in search space set #2. That is, in this example, PDCCH monitoring occasions are configured at a larger interval than a specific threshold in search space set #0, and PDCCH monitoring occasions are configured at a smaller interval than the specific threshold in search space set #1/2.</p>
<p id="p0535" num="0535">In this case, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring at the configured interval only in some starting slot(s) of a DL COT in each search space set #0/1/2. In slot(s) following the corresponding slot(s), PDCCH monitoring is performed at an interval of one slot, particularly in the earliest symbols (i.e., CORESET duration) of each slot in search space set #1/2 (whereas PDCCH monitoring may be performed still at an interval of 2 slots in search space set #0).</p>
<heading id="h0074"><u>3.2.1.2. [Method #2-2A] Method of controlling PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval</u></heading>
<p id="p0536" num="0536">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval may be controlled explicitly by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI (e.g., explicit signaling). According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval may be controlled implicitly after detection of a predetermined signal (e.g., a DL burst, a DM-RS, a GC-PDCCH and/or a PDCCH) and/or based on information about a COT structure.</p>
<p id="p0537" num="0537">For example, multiple PDCCH monitoring intervals may be configured for a specific search space set, and which one of the PDCCH monitoring intervals is to be used may be signaled. For example, when the PDCCH monitoring interval is signaled by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI, the UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI may include information about the PDCCH monitoring interval.</p>
<p id="p0538" num="0538">In another example, search space sets may be divided into two or more groups and a group including search space sets in which PDCCH monitoring will be performed may be signaled. For example, each of the groups may include one or more search space sets (one search space set may belong to two or more groups), and which one of the groups is used for PDCCH monitoring<!-- EPO <DP n="102"> --> may be signaled to the UE. For example, when the group is signaled by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI, the UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI may include information about the group. For example, it may be configured that a different PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval is applied to each group.</p>
<p id="p0539" num="0539">It may be difficult in terms of UE implementation for the UE to instantly change the monitoring behavior after the time of receiving explicit signaling (i.e., to change the monitoring behavior as soon as receiving the explicit signaling). In this regard, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the UE may perform PDCCH reception at an indicated PDCCH monitoring interval after Z symbols from the time of receiving the explicit signal (or from an HARQ-ACK feedback (for the explicit signaling)).</p>
<p id="p0540" num="0540">For example, it is assumed that PDCCH monitoring is configured at an interval of 2 slots (type A) or 4 slots (type B) in search space set #0, at an interval of 2 symbols (type A) or 1 slot (type B) in search space set #1, and at an interval of 7 symbols (type A) or 1 slot (type B) in search space set #2.</p>
<p id="p0541" num="0541">Based on the above assumption, for example, the BS may signal type A/type B as a PDCCH monitoring periodicity by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI. For example, the UE may apply the changed monitoring periodicity after Z symbols from the time of receiving the UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI.</p>
<p id="p0542" num="0542">In another example, it is assumed that PDCCH monitoring is configured at an interval of 2 slots in search space set #0, at an interval of 2 symbols in search space set #1, and at an interval of 7 symbols in search space set #2.</p>
<p id="p0543" num="0543">Based on the above assumption, for example, group A (or group #0) may set for search space set #0 and group B (or group #1) may set for search space set #1/2. For example, this configuration may be based on higher-layer signalling. For example, the UE may receive information indicating a group to which each search space set belongs, such as information indicating that search space set #0 belongs to group A, search space set #1 belongs to group B, and search space set #2 belongs to group B.</p>
<p id="p0544" num="0544">For example, the BS may signal which one of group A and group B (and/or which search space set related to the group) and/or which search space set is activated by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI. For example, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring in each<!-- EPO <DP n="103"> --> active search space set (e.g., in each search space set included in an active group) after Z symbols from the time of receiving the UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI.</p>
<p id="p0545" num="0545">That is, for example, the BS may indicate which one of group A and group B is active by the UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI, at a group level.</p>
<p id="p0546" num="0546">In another example, the BS may indicate which one of group A and group B an activated search space set belongs to by UE-specific DCI and/or cell-specific DCI. In this case, the BS may also indicate which one of the search space sets included in the group is activated.</p>
<p id="p0547" num="0547">The above-described method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied in the same manner to a method of controlling a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance according to a COT structure. In an exemplary embodiment, the UE may identify a COT structure by determining whether it is included in a DL Tx burst by the afore-described initial signal according to various embodiments of the present disclosure in subclause 3.1 (e.g., it is identified based on information related to the length of a DL Tx burst included in the initial signal and/or when the initial signal is discovered, a DL Tx burst is determined to span a predetermined length) or DCI format 2_0 (e.g., delivered on a GC-PDCCH) and/or a separate DCI format indicating the COT structure (e.g., delivered on a PDCCH and/or a GC-PDCCH).</p>
<p id="p0548" num="0548">Alternatively in an exemplary embodiment, a PDCCH monitoring periodicity and/or time instance interval may be controlled implicitly after detection of a predetermined signal (e.g., a DL burst, a DM-RS, a GC-PDCCH and/or a PDCCH) based on information about a COT structure.</p>

<p id="p0598" num="0598">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, when the UE performs PDCCH monitoring, a different PDCCH monitoring time pattern may be configured for each phase as follows.
<ul id="ul0064" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>Phase A: A period after phase C when a DL burst is not discovered (e.g., in a method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure) and/or after the DL burst is discovered.</li>
<li>Phase B: In the case where a DL burst is discovered (e.g., in a method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure), a PDCCH monitoring occasion is included in the starting k slot(s) of the DL burst. Herein, k may be preset to a specific value (e.g., k=1) or configured by higher-layer signaling such as RRC/MAC signaling.</li>
<li>Phase C: In the case a DL burst is discovered (e.g., in a method according to various embodiments of the present disclosure), a PDCCH monitoring occasion is not included in the starting k slot(s) of the DL burst.

<li>Opt 1: Explicitly signalled by specific DCI</li>
<li>Opt 2: Implicitly signalled by information indicating time-axis channel occupancy of the BS in DCI</li>

<p id="p0600" num="0600">For example, in Opt 1, the BS may indicate to the UE whether a slot carrying DCI (and/or the following n slot(s)) belongs to phase B/phase C by using a specific field (e.g., a new field indicating a phase) in the DCI and/or at least some state of an existing field in the DCI.<!-- EPO <DP n="112"> --></p>

For example, in Opt 2, when the UE recognizes the corresponding slot as a period belonging to phase C from the DCI indicating time-axis channel occupancy of the BS, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring corresponding to phase C in the slot.</p>
<p id="p0602" num="0602">In an exemplary embodiment, considering that the UE triggers a new PDCCH monitoring behaviour in each switching between phases, a time delay caused by a processing time of the UE may be considered.</p>
<p id="p0603" num="0603">For example, it is assumed that a time delay of X symbol(s) is taken for switching from phase A to phase B.</p>
<p id="p0604" num="0604">Based on the assumption, for example, it may be regulated that when the UE recognizes that phase B starts from symbol #Y, a PDCCH monitoring behaviour corresponding to phase B is actually applied, starting from symbol #(X+Y).</p>

<p id="p0607" num="0607">For example, a per-phase monitoring time pattern may be defined for each search space (and/or CORESET and/or DCI format and/or RNTI).</p>
<p id="p0608" num="0608">For example, the monitoring time pattern may include all or a part of at least the following parameters.
<ul id="ul0066" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li><i>monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset:</i> This parameter may be related to information about PDCCH monitoring slot(s) configured by a periodicity and an offset.

For example, if the value of the parameter is sl4, the UE may monitor a search space in every fourth slot.</li>
<li><i>monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot:</i> This parameter may be related to information about the first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in slot(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring.

<p id="p0612" num="0612">Referring to <figref idref="f0028">FIG. 28</figref>, in operation 2801 according to an exemplary embodiment, a BS may perform a DL CAP for a plurality of cells (e.g., cells included in a specific cell group) to transmit scheduling information to a UE. For example, the DL CAP for the plurality of cells may be one or more of the afore-described various DL CAPs for DL transmission.</p>
<p id="p0613" num="0613">In operation 2803 according to an exemplary embodiment, the BS may transmit scheduling information for one or more cells to the UE according to the result of the DL CAP.</p>
<p id="p0614" num="0614">For example, when the BS succeeds in the DL CAP only for some cell(s) of the plurality of cells, the BS may transmit scheduling information for one or more of the plurality of<!-- EPO <DP n="114"> --> cells (i.e., one or more cells among the plurality of cells) on one or more of the some cell(s) (i.e., on one or more cells among the some cell(s)). For example, in case 1 which will be described later, the BS may transmit scheduling information for a corresponding cell (and/or one or more of cells in which the DL CAP is failed) on a specific cell (in which the DL CAP is successful).</p>
<p id="p0615" num="0615">In another example, when the BS succeeds in the DL CAP for all of the plurality of cells, the BS may transmit scheduling information for one or more of the plurality of cells to the UE on the one or more of the plurality of cells. For example, as in case 2 which will be described later, the BS may transmit scheduling information for each cell on the cell to the UE (SCS) or scheduling information for a corresponding cell (and one or more other cells than the corresponding cell) on a specific one of the plurality of cells.</p>
<p id="p0616" num="0616">In operation 2805 according to an exemplary embodiment, the UE may perform a signal transmission/reception scheduled for one or more cells based on scheduling information (e.g., DCI) for the one or more cells, received from the BS. For example, when the UE is to transmit a specific signal on a specific cell (and/or a plurality of cells including the specific cell) to the BS, the UE may transmit the signal to the BS based on the result of a UL CAP for the specific cell (and/or the plurality of cells including the specific cell). For example, the UL CAP for the specific cell (and/or the plurality of cells including the specific cell) may be one or more of the afore-described UL CAPs for UL transmission.</p>

<p id="p0618" num="0618">In the LTE and NR systems, for example, CCS may be configured, in which a scheduling cell and a scheduled cell are different.

<p id="p0631" num="0631">For example, a cell group sharing COT information may be defined. For example, COT information about all carriers (cells) of the group may be delivered in DCI format 3 transmitted on any cell (or a specific predefined cell) of the cell group.</p>

Further, it may be regulated that information indicating whether the proposed methods are applied (or information about the rules of the proposed methods) is indicated to a UE by a pre-defined signal (or a physical-layer or higher-layer signal) by an eNB, or is requested to a receiving UE or a transmitting UE by the transmitting UE or the receiving UE.</p>
<heading id="h0091"><b>3.4. Initial network access and communication process</b></heading>
<p id="p0666" num="0666">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a UE may perform a network access process to perform the above-described/proposed procedures and/or methods. For example, the UE may receive system information and configuration information required to perform the above-described/proposed procedures and/or methods and store the received information in a memory. The configuration information required for various embodiments of the<!-- EPO <DP n="122"> --> present disclosure may be received by higher-layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling or MAC signaling).</p>
<p id="p0667" num="0667"><figref idref="f0029">FIG. 29</figref> is a diagram illustrating an initial network access and subsequent communication process. In an NR system to which various embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable, a physical channel and an RS may be transmitted by beamforming. When beamforming-based signal transmission is supported, beam management may be performed for beam alignment between a BS and a UE. Further, a signal proposed in various embodiments of the present disclosure may be transmitted/received by beamforming. In RRC_IDLE mode, beam alignment may be performed based on a synchronization signal block (SSB or SS/PBCH block), whereas in RRC_CONNECTED mode, beam alignment may be performed based on a CSI-RS (in DL) and an SRS (in UL). On the contrary, when beamforming-based signal transmission is not supported, beam-related operations may be omitted in the following description.</p>
<p id="p0668" num="0668">Referring to <figref idref="f0029">FIG. 29</figref>, a BS (e.g., eNB) may periodically transmit an SSB (S2702). The SSB includes a PSS/SSS/PBCH. The SSB may be transmitted by beam sweeping. The BS may then transmit remaining minimum system information (RMSI) and other system information (OSI) (S2704). The RMSI may include information required for the UE to perform initial access to the BS (e.g., PRACH configuration information). After detecting SSBs, the UE identifies the best SSB. The UE may then transmit an RACH preamble (Message 1; Msg1) in PRACH resources linked/corresponding to the index (i.e., beam) of the best SSB (S2706). The beam direction of the RACH preamble is associated with the PRACH resources. Association between PRACH resources (and/or RACH preambles) and SSBs (SSB indexes) may be configured by system information (e.g., RMSI). Subsequently, in an RACH procedure, the BS may transmit a random access response (RAR) (Msg2) in response to the RACH preamble (S2708), the UE may transmit Msg3 (e.g., RRC Connection Request) based on a UL grant included in the RAR (S2710), and the BS may transmit a contention resolution message (Msg4) (S2712). Msg4 may include RRC Connection Setup.</p>
<p id="p0669" num="0669">When an RRC connection is established between the BS and the UE in the RACH procedure, beam alignment may subsequently be performed based on an SSB/CSI-RS (in DL) and an SRS (in UL). For example, the UE may receive an SSB/CSI-RS (S2714). The SSB/CSI-RS may be used for the UE to generate a beam/CSI report. The BS may request the UE to transmit a beam/CSI report, by DCI (S2716). In this case, the UE may generate a beam/CSI report based on<!-- EPO <DP n="123"> --> the SSB/CSI-RS and transmit the generated beam/CSI report to the BS on a PUSCH/PUCCH (S2718). The beam/CSI report may include a beam measurement result, information about a preferred beam, and so on. The BS and the UE may switch beams based on the beam/CSI report (S2720a and S2720b).</p>
<p id="p0670" num="0670">Subsequently, the UE and the BS may perform the above-described/proposed procedures and/or methods. For example, the UE and the BS may transmit a wireless signal by processing information stored in a memory or may process received wireless signal and store the processed signal in the memory according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, based on configuration information obtained in the network access process (e.g., the system information acquisition process, the RRC connection process through an RACH, and so on). The wireless signal may include at least one of a PDCCH, a PDSCH, or an RS on DL and at least one of a PUCCH, a PUSCH, or an SRS on UL.</p>

<p id="p0671" num="0671"><figref idref="f0030">FIG. 30</figref> is an exemplary DRX operation according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0672" num="0672">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the UE may perform a DRX operation in the afore-described/proposed procedures and/or methods. When the UE is configured with DRX, the UE may reduce power consumption by receiving a DL signal discontinuously. DRX may be performed in an RRC_IDLE state, an RRC_INACTIVE state, and an RRC CONNECTED state. In the RRC_IDLE state and the RRC INACTIVE state, DRX is used to receive a paging signal discontinuously.</p>

<p id="p0673" num="0673">In in the RRC_CONNECTED state, DRX is used to receive a PDCCH discontinuously. DRX in the RRC CONNECTED state is referred to as RRC CONNECTED DRX).</p>
<p id="p0674" num="0674">Referring to <figref idref="f0030">FIG. 30(a)</figref>, a DRX cycle includes an On Duration and an Opportunity for DRX. The DRX cycle defines a time interval between periodic repetitions of the On Duration. The On Duration is a time period during which the UE monitors a PDCCH. When the UE is configured with DRX, the UE performs PDCCH monitoring during the On Duration. When the UE successfully detects a PDCCH during the PDCCH monitoring, the UE starts an inactivity timer and is kept awake. On the contrary, when the UE fails in detecting any PDCCH during the PDCCH monitoring, the UE transitions to a sleep state after the On Duration. Accordingly, when DRX is<!-- EPO <DP n="124"> --> configured, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring/reception discontinuously in the time domain in the afore-described procedures and/or methods. For example, when DRX is configured, PDCCH reception occasions (e.g., slots with PDCCH search spaces) may be configured discontinuously according to a DRX configuration in the present disclosure. On the contrary, when DRX is not configured, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring/reception continuously in the time domain in the afore-described procedures and/or methods according to implementation(s). For example, when DRX is not configured, PDCCH reception occasions (e.g., slots with PDCCH search spaces) may be configured continuously in the present disclosure. Irrespective of whether DRX is configured, PDCCH monitoring may be restricted during a time period configured as a measurement gap.</p>
<p id="p0675" num="0675">Table 19 describes a DRX operation of a UE (in the RRC_CONNECTED state). Referring to Table 19, DRX configuration information is received by higher-layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling), and DRX ON/OFF is controlled by a DRX command from the MAC layer. Once DRX is configured, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring discontinuously the afore-described procedures and/or methods according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.

The DRX configuration information may include a DRX cycle, a DRX offset, configuration information for a DRX timer, and the like. The UE repeats an On Duration and a Sleep duration according to a DRX cycle. The UE may operate in a wakeup mode during the On duration and in a sleep mode during the Sleep duration. In the wakeup mode, the UE may monitor a paging occasion (PO) to receive a paging message. A PO means a time resource/interval (e.g., subframe or slot) in which the UE expects to receive a paging message. PO monitoring includes monitoring a PDCCH (MPDCCH or NPDCCH) scrambled with a P-RNTI (hereinafter, referred to as a paging PDCCH) in a PO. The paging message may be included in the paging PDCCH or in a PDSCH scheduled by the paging PDCCH. One or more POs may be included in a paging frame (PF), and the PF may be periodically configured based on a UE ID. A PF may<!-- EPO <DP n="126"> --> correspond to one radio frame, and the UE ID may be determined based on the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of the UE. When DRX is configured, the UE monitors only one PO per DRX cycle. When the UE receives a paging message indicating a change of its ID and/or system information in a PO, the UE may perform an RACH procedure to initialize (or reconfigure) a connection with the BS, or receive (or obtain) new system information from the BS.
