<p id="p0002" num="0002">The application claims priority to and the benefit of <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR1020180151983"><text>Korean Patent Application No. 10-2018-0151983, filed on November 30, 2018</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR1020190101723"><text>Korean Patent Application No. 10-2019-0101723, filed on August 20, 2019</text></patcit>, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">There are 127 species or more classified by morphology and function in the genus Clostridium. Anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria, <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>, generates a potent polypeptide neurotoxin, such as botulinum toxin (hereinafter, the "toxin" used herein is also used interchangeably), causing a neuroparalytic disease known as botulism in humans and animals. Symptoms of the botulinum toxin poisoning may include gait abnormalities, dysphagia, speech disorders, and paralysis of respiratory muscles which may lead to death.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">One unit of the botulinum toxin is defined as LD<sub>50</sub> when intraperitoneally injected into female Swiss Webster mice weighing approximately 18 to 20 g. One<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> unit of the botulinum toxin is the amount of botulinum toxin that kills 50% of a group of female Swiss Webster mouse.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The characteristics of seven types of immunologically distinct botulinum neurotoxins, such as botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, F and G, which are distinguished by being neutralized with a type-specific antibody. According to the different serotypes of botulinum toxin, there are differences in the animal species affected thereby, and the severity and duration of paralysis caused thereby. Botulinum toxin apparently binds to cholinergic motor neurons with high affinity, relocates to a neuron, and blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Botulinum toxin has been used in a clinical setting for treating neuromuscular disorders characterized by hyperactive skeletal muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for essential blepharopasm, strabismus and hemifacial spasm in patients over age 12, and also approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia, glabellar (facial) wrinkles and hyperhidrosis. The FDA also approved botulinum toxin type B for the treatment of cervical dystonia, glabellar (facial) wrinkles.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Botulinum toxin type A is known to be soluble in a dilute aqueous solution with pH 4 to 6.8. A stabilizing non-toxic protein is separated from a neurotoxin at pH of approximately 7 or more, resulting in a gradual loss of toxicity, especially as the pH and temperature rise. As is common with enzymes, the biological activity of botulinum toxin (which is an intracellular peptidase) is at least partially dependent on the three-dimensional morphology thereof. Dilution to a solution containing of milligrams to nanograms of toxin per mL has considerable difficulty, for example, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tendency of reducing an amount of available toxin by the toxin adhering to a surface. In addition, a toxin-containing pharmaceutical composition is sometimes used months or years after preparation, and in this case, the toxin may be easily oxidized or decomposed into small fragments due to the nature of a protein. Therefore, it is necessary to stabilize the toxin with a stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Conventionally, to solve this problem, albumin, sucrose, trehalose and/or gelatin are mainly used as a stabilizer in the pharmaceutical process of a botulinum toxin protein.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">For example, as described below, for a botulinum toxin-containing pharmaceutical composition, albumin is used as a stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">A commercially available botulinum toxin-containing pharmaceutical composition is commercialized by Allergan, Inc (Irvine, CA) under the trade name BOTOX<sup>Â®</sup> (botulinum toxin type A, purified neurotoxin complex). 100 units/vial of BOTOX<sup>Â®</sup> consists of approximately 5 ng of the purified botulinum toxin type A complex, 0.5 mg human serum albumin, and 0.9 mg sodium chloride, and is in a vacuum-dried form, and prepared to be restored with sterile physiological saline without a preservative (injected with 0.9% sodium chloride). Other commercially available botulinum toxin-containing pharmaceutical compositions may include Dysport<sup>Â®</sup> <i>(Clostridium botulinum</i> type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex having lactose and human serum albumin among a botulinum toxin pharmaceutical composition, commercially available from Ipsen Limited, Berkshire, UK, a powder to be restored<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with 0.9% sodium chloride before use), and MyoBlocâ„¢ (an injectable solution containing botulinum toxin type B, human serum albumin, sodium succinate and sodium chloride at approximately pH 5.6, commercially available from Solstice Neurosciences, San Diego, CA). A neurotoxin component (150 kDa toxin molecule) and a botulinum toxin complex (300 kDa to 900 kDa) may be obtained from, for example, List Biological Laboratories, Inc (Campbell, CA); the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (Porton Down, UK); and Wako (Osaka, Japan), and also from Sigma Chemicals (Saint Louis, MI).</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, the reason why albumin is mainly used is that albumin may not only stabilize a protein active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition, but may also have the advantage of negligible immunogenicity when injected into human patients. However, blood products such as albumin may pose a potential risk of infecting a patient with a blood-derived pathogen or infectious microorganism, and particularly, the mediation of diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease delivered by viral infection or a viral protein may not be completely eliminated, and there may also be a risk of infecting a patient with a so far unknown pathogen. Therefore, when the above-described albumin is used as a stabilizer, selection of a donor or donation site is performed in a preparation process and the removal and/or inactivation of an infectious material should be performed to reduce the risk of spread of the infectious material.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, gelatin is sometimes used. However, since it is also a protein obtained from an animal, it may cause a disease like albumin, and therefore may not be recommended for use in a pharmaceutical process.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">As technology for using a stabilizer which is not derived from an animal source in a pharmaceutical process for a botulinum toxin protein, a method of utilizing a pharmaceutical preparation of recombinant albumin (rSA) produced in yeasts is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="KR100799400"><text>Korean Registered Patent No. 10-0799400</text></patcit>. However, since a novel antigenic structure, neoepitope, is generated in the production and isolation and recovery of recombinant albumin (rSA), the possibility of inducing an immune response in a recipient of the drug may not be completely eliminated.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="KR100665469"><text>Korean Registered Patent No. 10-0665469</text></patcit>, a pharmaceutical composition containing botulinum toxin, a polysaccharide (including hydroxyethyl starch), and lysine, glycine, histidine or arginine as an amino acid is disclosed. However, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is a composition for a freeze-dried formulation, and its storage condition is limited to freezing or refrigeration. The freeze-dried botulinum toxin needs a process of melting or diluting a frozen formulation immediately before use, and in this process, an error may be generated. Moreover, the freeze-dried botulinum toxin is inconvenient in use, and has a problem of impossible development in a prefilled syringe type.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Regarding a composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin, in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20070134199"><text>U.S. Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-0134199</text></patcit>, a composition containing a non-ionic surfactant containing polysorbate, and glutamine and glutamic acid or asparagine and aspartic acid as amino acids is disclosed. When botulinum toxin is diluted in the liquid composition of the present invention and stored under a refrigeration condition of 4 Â°C, it is stabilized over 8 months, but when the botulinum toxin is stored at room<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> temperature, for example, 37 Â°C, its activity is reduced within one month, so that there is a limit to stabilization of a pharmaceutical liquid composition containing botulinum toxin at room temperature.</p>

<p id="p0033" num="0033">Hereinafter, to help in understanding the present invention, exemplary examples will be suggested. However, the following examples are merely provided to more easily understand the present invention, and not to limit the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The present invention relates to a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin, which includes polysorbate 80 and serine as active ingredients; and a pharmaceutical composition in liquid formulation, which includes the liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin and botulinum toxin as active ingredients.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In addition, the present invention relates to a method of improving the stability of botulinum toxin using polysorbate 80 and serine.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The inventors conducted an experiment for ensuring a stabilizer which is safe since an animal-derived protein is not used, and has long-term stability at room temperature or even in storage in a refrigerator, as an alternative to a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin consisting of the combination of methionine and polysorbate 20. As a result, it was confirmed that the combination of serine and polysorbate 80 has an excellent effect of maintaining the activity of botulinum toxin at room temperature for a long time, and the present invention was completed.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In the present invention, the "stability or stabilization" means that the activity of botulinum toxin is maintained, and for example, the activity of botulinum toxin is maintained to be 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 100%, preferably, 50% or more, and most preferably, 100%, compared with that before the experiment or under specific conditions. For example, compared with the number of subjects<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> into which botulinum toxin is injected, a value obtained by (the number of dead subjects among subjects into which botulinum toxin is injected/the number of subjects into which botulinum toxin is injected) x 100 is maintained to be 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 100%, preferably, 50% or more, and most preferably, 100%. The activity of botulinum toxin may be measured according to various methods known in the art, and for example, measured with reference to the lethality assay method described in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>PearceL.B.et al 1994. Measurement of Botulinum Toxin Activity: Evaluation of the Lethality Assay. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology' 128: 69-77</text></nplcit>'. According to an experimental example of the present invention, 0.1 mL (3 or 4 units/0.1 mL/mouse) of the prepared botulinum toxin liquid composition was intraperitoneally injected into five or ten 4-week-old ICR (Institute of Cancer Research, USA) female mice, and then observed for 72 hours to confirm a mortality rate. In addition, the condition for "stability or stabilization" may refer to storage or distribution stability at room temperature, but the present invention is not limited thereto. According to a specific embodiment, the stability or stabilization condition may be a 35 to 45 Â°C/50 to 80% RH condition, and preferably, a 40 Â°C/70% RH condition.</p>

The molecular weight of a botulinum toxin protein derived from <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> type A, B, C, D, E, F or G, which does not contain a naturally-occurring complexing protein, is approximately 150 KDa. However, when a toxin protein is produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum,</i> a botulinum toxin protein is produced by forming various complexes with several hemagglutinin proteins that assist and protect the action of the botulinum toxin protein and non-hemagglutinin proteins. Botulinum toxin type A containing a naturally-occurring complexing protein is a complex having a molecular weight of approximately 900 kDa, 500 kDa or 300 kDa, botulinum toxin types B and C are complexes having a molecular weight of approximately 500 kDa, botulinum toxin type D is a complex having a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa or 500 kDa, and botulinum toxin types E and F are complexes having a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa.

<p id="p0059" num="0059">To select a stabilizer of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> toxin type A, an experiment for selecting the composition of a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin was performed using various stabilizers.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Using a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin having the composition as shown in Table 1 below, a botulinum toxin solution was prepared to have a concentration of 300 Unit/mL.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Like the patented Innotox formulation, a control was prepared by dissolving 20 mM methionine and 2 mg/mL polysorbate 20 in 10% saline. In addition, experimental groups (Examples 1 to 7) were prepared by dissolving each a 20 mM stabilizer in normal saline and dissolving 2 mg/mL of polysorbate 80 in 10% saline.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">The prepared botulinum toxin solution was stored in a stability chamber under conditions including 40 Â°C/70% RH, and sampled at regular intervals. 9 mL of an injectable solution (normal saline) was added to 1 mL of the sampled botulinum toxin solution to dilute the solution 10-fold, and the diluted sample was intraperitoneally injected into five 4-week-old ICR (Institute of Cancer Research, USA) female mice at 3 units/0.1 mL (1 unit = LD<sub>50</sub>). While observing for 72 hours after the intraperitoneal injection, the number of dead mice and the mortality rate corresponding thereto were assessed.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As a result, as shown in Table 1, other than Examples 1 and 4, and Control, a dramatic decrease in stability was confirmed. That is, the activity of botulinum toxin was maintained for a long time only in Examples 1 and 4 and Control.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">From the above result, it can be seen that the combination of serine and polysorbate 80 is a stabilizer that can replace the combination of methionine and polysorbate 80.

<p id="p0072" num="0072">An experiment for the stability of botulinum toxin according to the addition of methionine was performed with the combination of serine and polysorbate 80 selected as the composition of a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">Using a liquid composition for stabilizing botulinum toxin having the composition as described in Table 4 below, a botulinum toxin solution was prepared to have a concentration of 40 units/mL. A control was prepared by dissolving 20 mM<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> methionine and 2 mg/mL of polysorbate 20 in 10% saline like the patented Innotox formulation. An experimental group was prepared by dissolving 2 mg/mL of polysorbate 80, 5 to 50 mM serine and 0.4 mM methionine in 10% normal saline. A specific experimental method was carried out as described in Experimental Example 1. However, this method used 10 mice, and a concentration for intraperitoneal injection was 4 units/0.1 mL.
