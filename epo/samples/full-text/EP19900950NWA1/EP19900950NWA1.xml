<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Embodiments of this application relate to communication technologies, and in particular, to a data transmission method and a communication apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Currently, in a new radio (new radio, NR) system, the following manners are used to ensure transmission of TBs on an uplink data channel and a downlink data channel: 1. An adaptive modulation and coding (adaptive modulation and coding, AMC) scheme is used to modulate and encode to-be-transmitted TBs on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel, to select a proper modulation and coding scheme to adapt to radio channel quality and ensure transmission quality of a link. 2. Low density parity check coding (low density parity check coding, LDPC) is used to encode and decode to-be-transmitted TBs on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel, to improve reliability of data transmission by increasing check bits. 3. A hybrid automatic repeat request (hybrid automatic repeat-request, HARQ) technology is used to perform automatic retransmission and combined decoding on a TB that fails to be transmitted, to ensure correctness of data transmission.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">In a current technology, to ensure that demodulation and decoding can be performed correctly at a relatively high probability during an initial transmission, a smaller equivalent transmission code rate is used for transmitting a redundancy version (redundancy version, RV) of a TB on an uplink data channel or a downlink data channel. A smaller equivalent transmission code rate indicates a larger quantity of transmitted redundant check bits and a lower spectral efficiency. In addition, a receiving device may correctly decode the TB only when a total quantity of bits obtained after combined transmissions/HARQ retransmissions exceeds a quantity of bits required for correct channel decoding. However, start positions of four RVs of a mother code obtained after LDPC coding are defined in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the current NR system, where a distance between start positions of different RVs is relatively large. To ensure correct decoding, a length of a transmitted RV needs to be greater than or equal to a distance between start positions of two adjacent RVs. That is, the distance between the start positions of two adjacent RVs is a minimum granularity of a length of an RV. Consequently, a granularity of an RV transmitted each time is relatively large. Therefore, when a plurality of HARQ retransmissions are combined until the correct decoding of the TB, a total quantity of transmitted bits may be significantly greater than a smallest quantity of bits required for correct decoding of a current channel, resulting in a relatively low spectral efficiency. In other words, the spectral efficiency is relatively low when the foregoing manner is used to transmit the TB.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a data transmission method and a communication apparatus, to resolve a technical problem that a spectral efficiency is relatively low when an existing manner is used to transmit a TB.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a data transmission method. In the method, a network device sends first information to a terminal device, where the first information is used to indicate transport block size TBS configuration information and/or redundancy version RV configuration information, the TBS configuration information is used to configure a first transport block size TBS, and the RV configuration information is used to configure first RV information. The network device receives a transport block from the terminal device, or the network device sends a transport block to the terminal device, where a TBS of the transport block is the first TBS, and/or RV information of the transport block is the first RV information.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In the foregoing method, the network device may indicate the TBS configuration information and/or the RV configuration information to the terminal device by using the first information, and the network device may expand a TBS and/or refine an RV by using the TBS configuration information and/or the RV configuration information, so that the network device and the terminal device may transmit the TB by using the expanded TBS and/or the refined RV, thereby improving a spectral efficiency when the TB is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In a possible implementation, the first RV information includes at least one of the following information: a quantity M of RVs and start position information of the M RVs, where M is an integer greater than or equal to 1. In an example, a start position of each RV may be determined based on a length of the mother code obtained after transport block coding and a number of the start position of the RV in start positions of the M RVs. For example, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> start position of each RV is determined based on the length of the mother code obtained after transport block coding, a first parameter, and the number of the start position of the RV in the start positions of the M RVs, where the first parameter is used to determine a check matrix dimension corresponding to a coding scheme used by the transport block; or the start position of each RV is determined based on the length of the mother code obtained after transport block coding, M, the number of the start position of the RV in the start positions of the M RVs, and a preset bit offset.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In this possible implementation, the network device may flexibly indicate, based on a transmission requirement, a granularity of an RV used when the TB is transmitted between the network device and the terminal device, so that a spectral efficiency when the TB is transmitted may be improved when the refined RV is used.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the method further includes: The network device determines a sequence of the M RVs. Optionally, the first RV information further includes the sequence of the M RVs. Alternatively, the method further includes: The network device sends second information to the terminal device, where the second information is used to indicate a sequence of the M RVs. In this implementation, that the network device receives a transport block from the terminal device, or that the network device sends a transport block to the terminal device includes: The network device receives a first RV of the transport block from the terminal device, or the network device sends a first RV of the transport block to the terminal device, where the first RV is an RV in the M RVs. Optionally, the method further includes: The network device receives a second RV of the transport block from the terminal device, or the network device sends a second RV of the transport block to the terminal device, where the second RV is an RV in the M RVs. The first RV and the second RV are different, and a sending sequence of the first RV and the second RV satisfies a sequence relationship indicated by the sequence.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">In this possible implementation, the network device may flexibly indicate a transmission sequence of RVs used when the TB is transmitted between the network device and the terminal device.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Optionally, in the sequence relationship indicated by the sequence of the M RVs, a quantity of overlapping mother code bits in two adjacent RVs is the smallest, and bit start positions of the two adjacent RVs are the farthest in the mother code obtained after transport block coding. Alternatively, in the sequence relationship indicated by the sequence of the M RVs, a quantity of overlapping mother code bits in two adjacent RVs is the smallest, and the overlapping mother code bits include a largest quantity of system information bits.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">In this manner of determining an RV transmission sequence, overlapping information of RVs adjacent to each other in the transmission sequence may be reduced as much as possible, that is, a quantity of bits added to an RV in a current RV transmission compared with an RV in a previous transmission is maximized, so that a device that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> receives a TB may perform soft combination on all received RVs to obtain a better decoding gain.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the TBS configuration information is used to indicate a scaling factor of the transport block size, and the scaling factor is greater than 1. Alternatively, the TBS configuration information includes enabling information, and the enabling information is used to indicate whether to expand the transport block size. Optionally, when the enabling information is used to indicate to expand the transport block size, the enabling information is further used to indicate the scaling factor of the transport block size, where the scaling factor is greater than 1, or there is a correspondence between the scaling factor and a transmission parameter of the transport block. Alternatively, the network device sends third information to the terminal device, where the third information is used to indicate the scaling factor of the transport block size, and the scaling factor is greater than 1.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">In this possible implementation, the network device can flexibly expand the TBS of the TB transmitted between the network device and the terminal device, so that the network device may transmit the TB by using the expanded TBS, thereby improving a spectral efficiency when the TB is transmitted.</p>

<p id="p0061" num="0061">For ease of understanding of the embodiments of this application, several definitions are first introduced and described. Details are as follows.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">An uplink data channel is used to carry uplink data. For example, the uplink data channel is a physical uplink shared channel (physical uplink shared channel, PUSCH).</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">A downlink data channel is used to carry downlink data. For example, the downlink data channel is a physical downlink shared channel (physical downlink shared channel, PDSCH).</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Data is transmitted on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel in a form of a transport block (transmit block, TB), where a size of the TB may be represented by a transport block size (transmit block size, TBS) expressed in bits.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">For example, the mobile communication system is an NR system. Currently, in the NR system, the following manners are used to ensure transmission of TBs on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel:
<ol id="ol0001" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1. An adaptive modulation and coding (adaptive modulation and coding, AMC) scheme is used to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> modulate and encode to-be-transmitted TBs on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel, to select a proper modulation and coding scheme to adapt to radio channel quality and ensure transmission quality of a link.</li>
<li>2. Low density parity check coding (low density parity check coding, LDPC) is used to encode and decode to-be-transmitted TBs on the uplink data channel and the downlink data channel, to improve reliability of data transmission by increasing check bits.</li>
<li>3. A hybrid automatic repeat request (hybrid automatic repeat-request, HARQ) technology is used to perform automatic retransmission and combined decoding on a TB that fails to be transmitted, to ensure correctness of data transmission.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">The following uses the sending device and the receiving device as an example to describe a process of transmitting a TB in the NR system. It should be noted that when the sending device is a terminal device, the receiving device may be a network device; or when the sending device is a network device, the receiving device may be a terminal device.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">Step 1: The sending device determines an initial transport block size (transmit block size, TBS) of a to-be-transmitted TB based on a quantity of scheduled resource units, a transmission code rate, a modulation scheme, and a quantity of spatial multiplexing layers. This may be specifically shown in the following formula (1): <maths id="math0001" num="(1),"><math display="block"><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">info</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>N</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>⋅</mo><mi>v</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="138" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where

<li><i>N<sub>info</sub></i> represents the initial TBS, and <i>R</i> represents the transmission code rate of a channel, where 0&lt;R&lt;1;</li>
<li><i>Q<sub>m</sub></i> represents a quantity of bits that can be carried on one modulation symbol when the TB is modulated by using the modulation scheme. For example, a value of <i>Q<sub>m</sub></i> is 1 when the modulation scheme is binary phase shift keying (Binary Phase Shift Keying, BPSK), a value of <i>Q<sub>m</sub></i> may be 2 when the modulation scheme is quadrature phase shift keying (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, QPSK), and a value of <i>Q<sub>m</sub></i> may be 4 when the modulation scheme is 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, QAM);</li>
<li><i>ν</i> represents the quantity of spatial multiplexing layers. For example, it indicates single-layer transmission when a value of <i>ν</i> is 1, and it indicates two-layer spatial multiplexing transmission when a value of <i>ν</i> is 2; and</li>
<li>N represents a quantity of resource units occupied when the TB is transmitted. The resource unit herein may be the minimum resource granularity unit for scheduling in the NR system, for example, a resource element (Resource Element, RE). For example, if the resource unit is the RE, N may be obtained through calculation by using the following formula (2): <maths id="math0002" num="(2),"><math display="block"><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">RB</mi></msub><mo>⋅</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">SC</mi></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">sym</mi></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">DM</mi><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">RS</mi></mrow></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">oh</mi></msub></mfenced></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="138" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><i>N<sub>RB</sub></i> represents a quantity of scheduled resource blocks (Resource Block, RB), <i>N<sub>sc</sub></i> represents a quantity of subcarriers of each RB, <i>N<sub>sym</sub></i> represents a quantity of symbols in one slot (slot), <i>N<sub>DM</sub></i>-<i><sub>RS</sub></i> represents a quantity of REs occupied by a dedicated demodulation reference signal (dedicated modulation reference signal, DMRS) in the slot, and <i>N<sub>oh</sub></i> represents overheads configured by a higher layer parameter.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">Step 2: The sending device determines a TBS of the to-be-transmitted TB based on the determined initial TBS (that is, <i>N<sub>info</sub></i>)<i>.</i></p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">Case 1: When <i>N<sub>info</sub></i> ≤ 3824, the sending device may calculate an intermediate TBS (intermediate TBS) according to the following formula (3): <maths id="math0003" num="(3),"><math display="block"><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">info</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">in</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mi>max</mi><mfenced open="{" close="}" separators=""><msup><mn>24,2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup><mrow><mo>⌊</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">info</mi></msub><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></mfrac><mo>⌋</mo></mrow></mfenced></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="138" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where <maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="inline"><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">info</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">in</mi></msubsup></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="9" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/></maths> represents the intermediate TBS, and n = max{3,<i>log<sub>2</sub></i>[<i>N<sub>info</sub></i>] - 6}.</p>

<p id="p0078" num="0078"><i>N<sub>cb</sub></i> represents a length of the coded mother code written into a cyclic buffer, and <i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> is used to determine a size of the LDPC check matrix dimension.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">Therefore, after obtaining the mother codes obtained after the coding of the CBs, the sending device may perform, based on the foregoing RV transmission sequence and the start position of each RV, rate matching (for example, bit selection and interleaving coding) on the mother codes obtained after the coding of the CBs, to obtain a currently to-be-transmitted RV of each CB. The bit selection means that bits with a specific length (including a part of system information and check information) are selected from the coded mother code based on the start position of the currently to-be-transmitted RV as the currently to-be-transmitted RV of the CB. The specific length herein may be referred to as a length of an RV, and the length of the RV is greater than or equal to an interval between start positions of adjacent RVs. That is, the interval between the start positions of two adjacent RVs is a minimum granularity of the length of the RV. The interleaving coding refers to distributing information bits transmitted in time domain or frequency domain, or in both time domain and frequency domain, so that bursts of errors of a channel are spread in time, and a decoder can process these bursts of errors as random-like errors.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">For example, if it is determined, based on the foregoing RV transmission sequence, that the currently to-be-transmitted RV is the RV 2, the sending device may select, from a start position of the RV2, bits of the length of the RV as the RV 2, and perform interleaving coding on the RV 2.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">It may be understood that step 1 to step 3 are steps that need to be performed when the TB is transmitted for the first time, and step 1 to step 3 may not be performed again when the TB is retransmitted subsequently.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">Step 5: The sending device combines the currently to-be-transmitted RV of each CB, to obtain a currently to-be-transmitted RV of the TB.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">Step 6: The sending device performs processing such as scrambling and modulation on the currently to-be-transmitted RV of the TB, and sends the processed RV to the receiving device.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">After receiving the RV of the TB, the receiving device performs corresponding processing such as demodulation, descrambling, and decoding on the RV of the TB. If the decoding is incorrect, the receiving device may send a negative acknowledgement (negative acknowledgement, NACK) to the sending device, to indicate the sending device to perform HARQ retransmission on the TB.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">Correspondingly, after receiving the NACK sent by the receiving device, the sending device may perform the HARQ retransmission on the TB. That is, the sending device performs step 4 to step 6 again to send a next RV adjacent to the RV in the transmission sequence to the receiving device based on the transmission sequence of the RV. The receiving device combines all the received RVs until the receiving device correctly decodes the TB. It may be understood that not all RVs shown in the transmission sequence are transmitted, and it may be specifically determined based on a decoding status of the TB by the receiving device.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">For example, one TB is correctly decoded after being transmitted for three times. In this case, the sending device sends the RV 0 of the TB for the first time, including the RV 0 of each CB in the TB; sends the RV 2 of the TB for the second time, including the RV 2 of each CB in the TB; and sends the RV 3 of the TB for the third time, including the RV 3 of each CB in the TB. In this example, the RV 4 of the TB is not transmitted.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">When the TB is transmitted in the foregoing manner, an equivalent transmission code rate of the TB may be shown in the following formula (8): <maths id="math0023" num="(8),"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">system</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">information</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">bits</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">system</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">information</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">bits</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">check</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">information</mi><mspace width="1ex"/><mi mathvariant="italic">bits</mi></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0023" file="imgb0023.tif" wi="138" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where<br/>
the system information bits are system information bits included in the RV of the transmitted TB, and the check information bits are check information bits included in the RV of the transmitted TB.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">In a current technology, to ensure that demodulation and decoding can be correctly performed at a relatively high probability during an initial transmission, a smaller equivalent transmission code rate is used for transmitting the TB on an uplink data channel or a downlink data channel. A smaller equivalent transmission code rate indicates a larger quantity of transmitted system information bits and a lower spectral efficiency. In addition, the receiving device may correctly decode the TB only when a total quantity of bits obtained after combined transmissions exceeds a quantity of bits required for correct channel decoding. However, start positions of four RVs of a mother code obtained after LDPC coding are defined in the current NR system, where a distance between start positions of different RVs is relatively large. Consequently, a granularity of an RV transmitted each time is relatively large.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Therefore, when a plurality of HARQ retransmissions are combined until the correct decoding of the TB, a total quantity of transmitted bits may be greater than a smallest quantity of bits required for correct decoding of a current channel, resulting in a relatively low spectral efficiency. In other words, the spectral efficiency is relatively low when the foregoing manner is used to transmit the TB.</p>

<p id="p0106" num="0106">Optionally, the first information is used to indicate the RV configuration information, and the RV configuration information is used to configure the first RV information. In a possible implementation, the first RV information may include at least one of the following information: a quantity M of RVs and start position information of the M RVs, where M is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For example, a value of M may be any one of 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32, and the like. A smaller value of M indicates a larger interval between start positions of two adjacent RVs,<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> and a larger minimum threshold of a length of the RV/a larger minimum value of a length of the RV (which may also be referred to as a larger minimum granularity of the length of the RV). A larger value of M indicates a smaller interval between start positions of two adjacent RVs, and a smaller minimum threshold of a length of the RV/a smaller minimum value of a length of the RV (which may also be referred to as a smaller minimum granularity of the length of the RV). That is, the RV is more refined. Therefore, the RV with a value of M greater than 4 or greater than a specific value may also be referred to as a refined RV, and the specific value may be predefined or configured. During specific implementation, the value of M may be specifically set based on a requirement of the mobile communication system. For example, when a strict requirement on a transmission latency is required, M with a relatively small value (for example, 2 or 4) may be selected, to reduce a quantity of times of retransmissions of the TB. When a relatively high spectrum resource efficiency is required, M with a relatively large value (for example, 6, 8, 16, or 32) may be selected. Optionally, in some embodiments, when channel state information (channel state information, CSI) feedback is inaccurate or a CSI feedback granularity is relatively coarse, for example, when a channel quality indicator (channel quality indicator, CQI) of a configured wideband fed back by the CSI is inaccurate or the granularity is relatively coarse, M with a relatively large value (for example, a value greater than 4) may be selected.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">The start position of each RV may be determined based on a length of the mother code obtained after TB coding, and a number of the start position of the RV in start positions of the M RVs.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">For example, the start position of each RV may be determined based on the length of the mother code obtained after TB coding, a first parameter, and the number of the start position of the RV in the start positions of the M RVs. The first parameter herein is used to determine a check matrix dimension corresponding to a coding scheme used by the TB, for example, <i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> in Table 1. An example in which the first parameter is <i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> is used for description in the following embodiments. It may be understood that, when the TB is segmented into a plurality of CBs, the quantity M of RVs and the start position information of the M RVs are a quantity of RVs of each CB in the TB and the start position information of the RVs.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">For example, when the value of M is 8, all start positions of RVs in original four RVs may respectively correspond to start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 0, 2, 4, and 6 in eight RVs. However, start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7 are located in a start interval of two RVs adjacent to the front and back of the RV. For example, the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 1 may be an intermediate value between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 0 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 2; the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 3 may be an intermediate value between the start position of the RV<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 2 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4; the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 5 may be an intermediate value between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 6; and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 7 may be an intermediate value between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 6 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 0.</p>

<p id="p0111" num="0111">For example, when the value of M is 16, all start positions of RVs in the original four RVs may respectively correspond to start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 0, 4, 8, and 12 in 16 RVs. Start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 1, 2, and 3 may be located in a start interval between a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 0 and a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4. For example, the start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 1, 2, and 3 may respectively correspond to one quarter point of the start interval between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 0 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4. Start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 5, 6, and 7 may be located in a start interval between a start<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4 and a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 8. For example, the start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 5, 6, and 7 may respectively correspond to one quarter point of the start interval between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 4 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 8. Start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 9, 10, and 11 may be located in a start interval between a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 8 and a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 12. For example, the start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 9, 10, and 11 may respectively correspond to one quarter point of the start interval between the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 8 and the start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 12. Start positions of RVs whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> numbers are 13, 14, and 15 may be located in a start interval between a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 12 and a start position of the RV whose <i>Rν<sub>id</sub></i> number is 0.

<p id="p0113" num="0113">It can be learned from Table 4 and Table 5 that, a larger value of M indicates more refined and more even segmentation performed on the coded mother code at the start positions of the M RVs.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">For another example, the start position of each RV is determined based on the length of the mother code obtained after TB coding, M, the number of the start position of the RV in the start positions of the M RVs, and a preset bit offset. It may be understood that, when the TB is segmented into a plurality of CBs, the quantity M of RVs and the start position information of the M RVs are a quantity of RVs of each CB in the TB and the start position information of the RVs.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">For example, the start position of each RV may be calculated according to the following formula (9), specifically: <maths id="math0068" num="(9),"><math display="block"><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn><mfenced><mi>i</mi></mfenced></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>⌊</mo><mfrac><mi>L</mi><mi>M</mi></mfrac><mo>⌋</mo></mrow><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="italic">RV</mi><mfenced><mi>i</mi></mfenced></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi></math><img id="ib0068" file="imgb0068.tif" wi="138" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where<br/>

<p id="p0116" num="0116">Optionally, the RV configuration information is used to indicate the quantity M of RVs, and the RV<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> configuration information may indicate M, for example, by carrying the value of M, or by using an index used to represent the value of M. Still optionally, the RV configuration information is used to indicate start position information of the M RVs, and the RV configuration information may indicate the start position information of the M RVs, for example, by carrying an index used to represent the start position of each RV, or indicate the start position information of the M RVs by carrying an index of a table used to represent the start position information of the M RVs. It should be noted that the RV configuration information may be used to indicate at least one of the quantity M of RVs and the start position information of M RVs, or another manner may be used for indication. This is not limited.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">It should be noted that, when the RV configuration information is used to indicate only the quantity M of RVs, the start position information of the M RVs may be preset on the network device and the terminal device, or may be calculated by the network device and the terminal device according to, for example, the foregoing formula (9). This is not limited.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">In addition, in the foregoing implementation, a sequence of the M RVs may be preconfigured or stored on the network device and the terminal device, or may be indicated by the network device to the terminal device by using the RV configuration information (that is, the first RV information may further include the sequence of the M RVs), or may be indicated by the network device to the terminal device by using second information. The second information may be carried in first signaling, or may be carried in second signaling other than the first signaling. The second signaling may be higher layer signaling or physical layer signaling. In other words, the second signaling is used to indicate the sequence of the M RVs. For a description of the higher layer signaling, refer to the foregoing description of the first signaling.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">During specific implementation, the RV configuration information may indicate the sequence of the M RVs, or the like by carrying a transmission sequence of the M RVs, or by carrying an index used to indicate a transmission sequence of the M RVs. This is not limited.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">The sequence of the M RVs described herein is used to indicate the transmission sequence of the M RVs in a HARQ process. For example, the network device is a sending device and the terminal device is a receiving device. In a process in which the network device transmits the TB to the terminal device, if the network device sends one of the M RVs of the TB to the terminal device, it is assumed that the RV is a first RV. In this case, if the TB is not correctly decoded by the terminal device, the network device may retransmit a next RV adjacent to the first RV in the transmission sequence to the terminal device, and it is assumed that the next RV is a second RV. In other words, the second RV is one of the M RVs, the second RV and the first RV are different, and a sending sequence of the first RV<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> and the second RV satisfies a sequence relationship indicated by the sequence of the M RVs. On the contrary, when the network device is a receiving device and the terminal device is a sending device, the RV of the TB sent by the terminal device to the network device also satisfies a sequence relationship indicated by the sequence of the M RVs. Details are not described herein again. It may be understood that a meaning of the sequence relationship is the same as that of the transmission sequence. This is not distinguished.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">The transmission sequence (which may also be referred to as the sequence relationship) indicated by the sequence of the M RVs may be a transmission sequence determined based on a link simulation result, or may be a transmission sequence determined by the network device based on the following principles:</p>

<p id="p0126" num="0126">In this manner of determining an RV transmission sequence, overlapping information of RVs adjacent to each other in the transmission sequence may be reduced as much as possible, that is, a quantity of check bits added to an RV in a current RV transmission compared with an RV in a previous transmission is maximized, so that a device that receives a TB may perform soft combination on all received RVs to obtain a better decoding gain.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">The following describes, by using a specific example, how to improve a spectral efficiency by using a refined RV. Details are as follows.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a spectrum resource according to an embodiment of this application. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, if a TBS is 700 bits, a quantity of bits required for correct decoding under a current channel condition is 1000, and a quantity of bits of a mother code obtained after LDPC coding is 3000.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">Using existing 4 RVs as an example, that is, a value of M is 4. An interval between start positions of two adjacent RVs is approximately equal to 750 bits (that is, a quotient of the quantity of bits of the coded mother code and M). To ensure that all RVs can traverse all bit positions of the coded mother code, a minimum length of the RV is 750 bits. A quantity of bits required for correct decoding under the current channel condition is 1000. In other words, two RVs need to be transmitted for correct decoding. In this scenario, a total quantity of transmitted bits used when a TB is transmitted is 1500 bits, and 500 bits of spectrum resources are wasted.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">If 8 RVs that are more refined than 4 RVs are used, an interval between start positions of two adjacent RVs is 375 bits. To ensure that all RVs can traverse all bit positions of the coded mother code, the minimum length of the RV is 375 bits. In this scenario, three RVs need to be transmitted for correct decoding, the total quantity of<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> transmitted bits used when the TB is transmitted is 1125 bits, and 125 bits of spectrum resources are wasted.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">It can be learned from the foregoing example that, if a start position of a more refined RV is set, a granularity of the RV in a single transmission may be smaller, and RVs in a plurality of HARQ transmissions can be more accurately close to a minimum quantity of resources required for correct decoding, so that a bearer capability of a current channel can be more accurately adapted, waste of resources during the correct decoding is reduced, and the spectral efficiency is improved.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">The foregoing embodiments describe how to improve the spectral efficiency when the TB is transmitted based on the RV configuration information indicated by the first information. The following describes how to improve the spectral efficiency when the TB is transmitted based on TBS configuration information indicated by the first information. Details are as follows.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">In this embodiment, a first TBS configured by the TBS configuration information may be an expanded TBS, or may be an unexpanded TBS. The unexpanded TBS herein may be a TBS determined by calculating a TBS in a current technology, for example, the TBS determined in step 1 and step 2 in the description of an existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments. The expanded TBS is greater than the unexpanded TBS. Compared with the unexpanded TBS, the expanded TBS is used for transmitting the TB, so that more system information bits can be transmitted on a same resource unit. Therefore, an equivalent transmission code rate of the TB can be increased, and even exceeds 1.0, thereby improving the spectral efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">In a possible implementation, the TBS configuration information may include enabling information, and the enabling information is used to indicate whether to expand the transport block size. That is, the transport block size is enabled to be expanded or to be not expanded. When the enabling information is used to indicate to expand the transport block size, the first TBS is the expanded TBS. In other words, the network device may use the expanded TBS to transmit the TB. When the enabling information is used to indicate not to expand the transport block size, the first TBS is the unexpanded TBS. The network device may transmit the TB by using the TBS determined in step 1 and step 2 in the description of the existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">In another possible implementation, the TBS configuration information may indirectly indicate, by using whether to indicate a scaling factor of the transport block size, whether to expand the transport block size. For example, when the TBS configuration information indicates the scaling factor of the transport block size, and the scaling factor is greater than 1, the first TBS is the expanded TBS. In other words, the network device may use the expanded TBS<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> to transmit the TB. When the TB S configuration information does not indicate the scaling factor of the transport block size, or a value of the indicated scaling factor of the transport block size is 1, the first TBS is the unexpanded TBS, and the network device may transmit the TB by using the TBS determined in step 1 and step 2 in the description of the existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0136" num="0136">It may be understood that when the first TBS indicated by the TBS configuration information is the unexpanded TBS, the network device and the terminal device may determine the first TBS based on the manners shown in step 1 and step 2 in the description of the existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">The following mainly describes how the network device and the terminal device determine the first TBS when the first TBS configured by the TBS configuration information is the expanded TBS.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">When the TBS configuration information indirectly indicates a size of the expanded transport block by using the indicated scaling factor of the transport block size, the value of the first TBS may be directly determined based on the indicated scaling factor of the transport block size. For descriptions of a scaling factor <i>β</i> and how to calculate the value of the first TBS based on the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block, refer to subsequent descriptions.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">When the TBS configuration information indicates to expand the transport block size by using the enabling information, the value of the first TBS may be determined in the following several manners.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">Manner 1: The value of the first TBS is a predefined value.</p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Manner 2: The value of the first TBS may be a value determined based on the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size. The scaling factor <i>β</i> may be greater than 1. The following describes how to determine the value of the first TBS based on the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">A sending device may determine an initially expanded TBS based on a quantity of scheduled resource units, a transmission code rate, a modulation scheme, a quantity of spatial multiplexing layers, and the scaling factor <i>β</i>.

<p id="p0156" num="0156">It may be understood that, although the foregoing examples are all described by using an example in which the value of the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size is directly indicated, a person skilled in the art may understand that the value of the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size may also be indirectly indicated by using<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> an index corresponding to the value of the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size. Implementations thereof are similar. Details are not described herein again.</p>
<p id="p0157" num="0157">In addition, when the scaling factor <i>β</i> of the transport block size has a plurality of values, for example, a proper value may be selected based on the current channel condition, and a requirement on the spectral efficiency, to appropriately expand the TBS, thereby ensuring accuracy of TBS scaling.</p>
<p id="p0158" num="0158">According to the foregoing TBS scaling method, the equivalent transmission code rate of the TB can be increased when a current LDPC coding requirement of a data channel in current NR is met, so that the equivalent transmission code rate can even be greater than 1.0, thereby improving the spectral efficiency of data transmission.</p>
<p id="p0159" num="0159">It may be understood that, when the first information is used to indicate the TBS configuration information and the RV configuration information, the expanded TBS and a refined RV may be used in combination. That is, the expanded TBS may be first determined based on the TBS configuration information, and then the data transmission is performed by using M with a relatively large value and by using a more refined RV, to further improve the spectral efficiency of the data transmission. For an implementation thereof, refer to the foregoing respective descriptions. Details are not described herein again.</p>
<p id="p0160" num="0160">It should be noted that, the foregoing expanded TBS and/or the refined RV are two relatively independent solutions. That is, both the foregoing expanded TBS and the refined RV can be used to increase the equivalent transmission code rate, and can evenbe used to enable the equivalent transmission code rate greater than 1.0. Therefore, a joint design of the expanded TBS and/or the refined RV may be performed based on the value of the equivalent transmission code rate of the expanded TBS, and specific information of the design is indicated to the terminal device in the foregoing manners, to be applicable to the data transmission under different channel conditions and different transmission requirements.</p>
<p id="p0161" num="0161">In some embodiments, after the TBS is expanded, a higher equivalent transmission code rate indicates a shorter length of an actually transmitted RV. To ensure that all RVs can traverse all bits of the coded mother code, more refined RVs need to be used. That is, a quantity of start positions of the RVs needs to be larger, so that reliability of the data transmission can be ensured with reference to a decoding gain by combination of HARQ retransmissions. The following provides descriptions by using an example.</p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">If an initial transmission code rate (where a code rate on which the TBS scaling and the RV refining are not performed, or the transmission code rate may be determined by using a current technology) is 3/4. That the TBS is expanded by using the radical-type scaling factor β of the transport block size is used as an example. If the value<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> of the scaling factor β of the transport block size is 2, the equivalent transmission code rate is approximately equal to 3/2 (that is, a product of the initial code rate and the scaling factor). It may be understood that the foregoing description herein is approximately equal to that after the initial TBS is expanded by twice, the value of the expanded TBS needs to be determined based on the manner shown in step 2 in the description of the existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments. The value of the expanded TBS determined in this manner is approximately twice the initial TBS. In this case, the equivalent code rate is relatively high, and a more refined RV design, for example, 16 RVs, is recommended.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">If that the TBS is expanded by using the moderate-type of scaling factor β of the transport block size is used as an example, and if the value of the scaling factor β of the transport block size is 1.4, the equivalent transmission code rate is approximately equal to 1.05 (that is, a product of the initial code rate and the scaling factor). It may be understood that the foregoing description herein is approximately equal to that after the initial TBS is expanded by 1.4 times, the value of the expanded TBS needs to be determined based on the manner shown in step 2 in the description of the existing process of transmitting the TB in the NR system in the foregoing method embodiments. The value of the expanded TBS determined in this manner is approximately 1.05 times the initial TBS. In this case, the equivalent code rate is relatively low, and a more refined RV design, for example, 8 RVs, is recommended.</p>
<p id="p0164" num="0164">In addition, when the first information is used to indicate the TBS configuration information and the RV configuration information, if the TBS configuration information is used to indicate the scaling factor β of the transport block size, and the RV configuration information is used to indicate a quantity M of RVs, for example, indication may be performed in a manner shown in the following Table 10:
