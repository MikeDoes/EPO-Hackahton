<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present application relates to the field of optical fingerprint technologies, and in particular, to a fingerprint identification apparatus and an electronic device.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">With the advent of the era of a full-screen mobile phone, the application of an under-display fingerprint identification apparatus is more and more widely used, among which an under-display optical fingerprint identification apparatus is most popular. At present, the under-display optical fingerprint identification apparatus that enjoys mass production in the industry mainly adopts two schemes. One is to adopt a small aperture imaging scheme. In actual industrial production, the size of the small aperture cannot be further reduced, thereby limiting improvement of resolution of a fingerprint image. Besides, the small aperture only allows incident light in the perpendicular direction to enter, failing to provide sufficient light which causes a relatively limited imaging signal, and affecting the quality of the fingerprint image. The other is to adopt an optical lens scheme, which uses a spherical or aspherical lens for converging light and imaging. Under the trend of sliming the mobile phone, there is a shorter distance from a finger-pressing screen surface of the mobile phone to a fingerprint acquisition region of an optical chip, and a total optical thickness of the optical lens is smaller. Therefore, a fingerprint acquisition area of the scheme is very limited, failing to perform a large-area fingerprint acquisition, which affects performance of the fingerprint identification apparatus.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Therefore, how to improve the performance of the under-display optical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> fingerprint identification apparatus becomes an urgent problem to be solved.</p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b></heading>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Technical solutions of embodiments of the present application is hereinafter described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">It should be understood that embodiments of the present application could be applied to an optical fingerprint system, including, but not limiting to an optical fingerprint recognition system and a product based on optical fingerprint imaging. Embodiments of the present application is merely described by taking the optical fingerprint system as an example but not intended to impose any limitation on embodiments of the present application. Besides, embodiments of the present application is also applicable to other systems adopting the technology of optical imaging.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">As a common application scenarios, an optical fingerprint system provided by the embodiments of the present application can be applied to a smart phone, a tablet computer and another mobile terminal having a display screen or another electronic device; and more particularly, in the foregoing electronic devices, a fingerprint identification apparatus may specifically be an optical fingerprint apparatus, which may be disposed in a partial region or an whole region under a display screen, thereby forming an under-display (Under-display) optical fingerprint system. Alternatively, the fingerprint identification apparatus may be partially or entirely integrated in the interior of the display screen of the electronic device to form an in-display (In-display) optical fingerprint system.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic structural diagram of an electronic device applicable to an embodiment of the present application. An electronic device 10 includes a display screen 120 and an optical fingerprint apparatus 130, where the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 is disposed in a partial region under the display screen 120. The optical fingerprint apparatus 130 includes an optical fingerprint sensor. The optical fingerprint sensor includes a sensing array 133 having a plurality of optical sensing units 131, and a region where the sensing array 133 is located or a sensing region thereof is a fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the fingerprint detecting region 103 is located in a display region of the display screen 120. In an alternative embodiment, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may also be disposed at other positions, such as a side of the display screen 120 or non-light transmitting region at an edge of the electronic device 10, and a light signal of at least part of the display region of the display screen 120 is directed to optical fingerprint apparatus 130 through a light path design, such that fingerprint detecting region 103 is actually located in the display region of the display screen 120.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">It should be understood that an area of the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may be different from an area of the sensing array of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130. For example, through a lens imaging light path design, a reflective folding light path design or other light path designs such as light convergence or reflection so that the area of the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 is larger than the area of the sensing array of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130. In other alternative implementation manners, if the light path is directed in a manner of, for example, light collimation, the area of the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may also be designed to be substantially identical with the area of the sensing array of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Therefore, when a user needs to unlock electronic device or perform other fingerprint verification, a fingerprint input can be implemented merely by pressing a finger on the fingerprint detecting region 103 in display screen 120. Since fingerprint detection may be implemented in the screen, there is no need to exclusively reserve<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> space for a front surface of the electronic device 10 adopting the foregoing structure to set a fingerprint button (such as a Home button), so that a full screen solution may be adopted; that is, the display region of the display screen 120 may be substantially extended to an entire front surface of the electronic device 10.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">As an alternative implementation manner, as shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 includes a light detecting portion 134 and an optical component 132. The light detecting portion 134 includes the sensing array, a readout circuit and other auxiliary circuits electrically connected to the sensing array, which is produced in a die (Die) by a semiconductor process such as an optical imaging chip or an optical fingerprint sensor; the sensing array is specifically a photo detector (Photo detector) array including a plurality of photo detectors distributed in an array, and the photo detectors may be used as the optical sensing unit as described above. The optical component 132 may be disposed on the sensing array of the light detecting portion 134, and may specifically include a light directing layer or a light path directing structure, and other optical elements, and the light directing layer or light path directing structure is mainly configured to direct reflected light reflected from a finger surface to the sensing array for optical detection.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In a specific implementation, the optical component 132 and light detecting portion 134 may be encapsulated in the same optical fingerprint component. For example, the optical component 132 and the light detecting portion 134 may be encapsulated in the same optical fingerprint chip, or the optical component 132 may be disposed outside a chip where the light detecting portion 134 is located, for example, the optical component 132 is attached on the chip, or part of elements of the optical component 132 are integrated into the chip.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">There are various implementations for the light directing layer or light path directing structure of the optical component 132, for example, the light directing layer may be specifically a collimator (Collimator) layer produced on a semiconductor silicon wafer, which has a plurality of collimating units or micro-pore arrays, and the collimating unit may be specifically a hole. Light in the reflected light reflected from the finger that is vertically incident to the collimating unit may pass through the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> collimating unit and be received by the optical sensing unit under it, however, light with an excessive large incident angle is attenuated through multiple reflection inside the collimating unit, and therefore, each optical sensing unit may substantially only receive the reflected light reflected from a fingerprint pattern right above the optical sensing unit, and thus the sensing array may detect a fingerprint image of the finger.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In another embodiment, the light directing layer or the light path directing structure may also be an optical lens (Lens) layer having one or more lens units, for example, a lens group composed of one or more aspheric lenses, for converging reflected light reflected from the finger to the sensing array of the light detecting portion 134 under it, so that the sensing array may perform imaging based on the reflected light so as to obtain the fingerprint image of the finger. Optionally, the optical lens layer may be provided with a pinhole in the optical path of the lens unit, and the pinhole may cooperate with the optical lens layer to expand the field of view of the optical fingerprint apparatus, to improve a fingerprint imaging effect of optical fingerprint apparatus 130.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In other embodiments, light directing layer or the light path directing structure may also specifically adopt a micro-lens (Micro-Lens) layer having a micro-lens array constituted by a plurality of micro-lenses, which may be formed on the sensing array of light detecting portion 134 by a semiconductor growth process or other processes, and each micro-lens may correspond to one of the sensing units in the sensing array respectively. Furthermore, other optical film layers such as a dielectric layer or a passivation layer, may be formed between the micro-lens layer and the sensing unit, and more specifically, a light blocking layer having a micro-pore may also be formed between the micro-lens layer and the sensing unit, where the micro-pore is formed between the corresponding micro-lens and sensing unit, and the light blocking layer may block optical interference between adjacent micro-lenses and the sensing units, such that light corresponding to the sensing unit is converged to the interior of the micro-pore through the micro-lens and is transmitted to the sensing unit via the micro-pore to perform optical fingerprint imaging. It should be understood that several implementations of the forgoing light path directing structure may be used alone or in combination, for example, a micro-lens layer may be further disposed under the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> collimator layer or optical lens layer. Certainly, when the collimator layer or optical lens layer is used in combination with the micro-lens layer, the specific laminated structure or light path may require to be adjusted according to actual needs.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">As an optional embodiment, the display screen 120 may adopt a display screen with a self-emitting display unit, such as an organic light-emitting diode (Organic Light-Emitting Diode, OLED) display screen or a micro light-emitting diode (Micro-LED) display screen. In an example of an OLED display screen, optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may use display unit (that is, an OLED light source) located at the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the OLED display screen 120 as an excitation light source for optical fingerprint detection. When a finger 140 is pressed the fingerprint detecting region 103, the display screen 120 emits a beam of light 111 to the target finger 140 above the fingerprint detecting region 103, and the light 111 is reflected on a surface of the finger 140 to form reflected light or scattered light after scattering inside the finger 140. In related patent applications, the reflected light and scattered light are collectively referred to as reflected light for convenience of description. Since a ridge (ridge) and a valley (valley) of a fingerprint have different light reflecting capabilities, reflected light 151 from the ridge of the fingerprint and the reflected light 152 from the valley of the fingerprint have different light intensities. After passing through the optical component 132, the reflected light is received by the sensing array 134 in the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 and converted into corresponding electrical signal, that is, a fingerprint detecting signal; and fingerprint image data may be obtained based on the fingerprint detecting signal, and fingerprint matching verification may be further performed, thereby implementing an optical fingerprint identification function at the electronic device 10.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In other embodiments, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may also use an internal light source or an external light source to provide a light signal for fingerprint detection. In this case, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may be applied to a non-self-emitting display screen, such as a liquid crystal display screen or other passive light-emitting display screens. Taking a liquid crystal display screen having a backlight module and a liquid crystal panel as an example, in order to support under-display<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> fingerprint detection of the liquid crystal display screen, the optical fingerprint system of the electronic device 10 may further include an excitation light source for optical fingerprint detection. The excitation light source may specifically be an infrared light source or a light source of non-visible light with a specific wavelength, which may be disposed under the backlight module of the liquid crystal display screen or disposed in an edge region under a protective cover of the electronic device 10. The optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may be disposed under the liquid crystal panel or the edge region of the protective cover, and light for fingerprint detection may reach the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 by being directed by a light path. Alternatively, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may also be disposed under the backlight module, and the backlight module allows the light for fingerprint detection to pass through the liquid crystal panel and the backlight module and reach the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 by providing a hole on film layers such as a diffusion sheet, a brightening sheet, a reflection sheet or the like, or by performing other optical designs. When optical fingerprint apparatus 130 uses an internal light source or an external light source to provide a light signal for fingerprint detection, a detection principle is consistent with the foregoing description.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">It should be understood that, in a specific implementation, electronic device 10 further includes a transparent protective cover; and the cover may be a glass cover or a sapphire cover, which is located on the display screen 120 and covers a front surface of the electronic device 10. Therefore, in an embodiment of the present application, the so-called finger pressing the display screen 120 actually refers to the finger pressing the cover on the display screen 120 or a surface of the protective layer covering the cover.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">It should also be understood that, the electronic device 10 further includes a circuit board 150, and the circuit board is disposed under the optical fingerprint apparatus 130. The optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may be bonded to circuit board 150 by a backside adhesive, and electronic connection with circuit board 150 is achieved by a pad and a metal wire welding. The optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may achieve electrical interconnection and signal transmission with other peripheral circuits or other elements of the electronic device 10 through the circuit board 150. For example,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may receive a control signal of a processing unit of the electronic device 10 through the circuit board 150, and may also output a fingerprint detecting signal from the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 to the processing unit, a control unit and the like of the electronic device 10 through the circuit board 150.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">On the other hand, in some embodiments, the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may include only one optical fingerprint sensor, and in this case, the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 has a smaller area and a fixed position, therefore, when inputting the fingerprint, the user needs to press the finger to a specific position of the fingerprint detecting region 103, otherwise the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may not be able to collect the fingerprint image, thereby resulting in poor user experience. In other alternative embodiments, optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may specifically include a plurality of optical fingerprint sensors which may be disposed under the display screen 120 side by side in a splicing manner, and sensing regions of the plurality of optical fingerprint sensors collectively constitute the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130. In other words, the fingerprint detecting region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may include a plurality of sub-regions, each sub-region corresponding to a sensing region of one of the optical fingerprint sensors respectively, so that a fingerprint acquisition region 103 of the optical fingerprint apparatus 130 may be extended to a main region of a lower portion of the display screen, that is, extended to a region that is generally pressed by a finger, thereby achieving a blind pressing type of a fingerprint input operation. Alternatively, when the number of optical fingerprint sensors is sufficient, the fingerprint detecting region 103 may also be extended to a half of the display region or even the entire display region, thereby achieving half-screen or full-screen fingerprint detection.</p>
