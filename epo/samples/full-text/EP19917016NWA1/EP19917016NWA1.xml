There is a distance less than or equal to 2 mm between the position of an upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 in a front-to-rear direction. Optionally, there is a distance of 0 mm between the position of the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 in the front-to-rear direction. In other words, their positions coincide with each other. Such structural arrangement allows for increased optical<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> efficiency. The upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser is shaped like a low beam cut-off line so as to be configured to intercept low-beam light to create a low-beam light pattern. The lens 6 is arranged at a position in front of the high beam condenser 4 and configured to receive light travelling from the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser 4. Light emitted from the low beam light source 1a is reflected by the low beam reflector 2 and then is directed to the lens 6 over the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and refracted by the lens 6 to form a low-beam light pattern. Light emitted from the high beam light source 3a is refracted and reflected by the high beam condenser 4 and then exits from the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and is directed to the lens 6 and refracted by the lens 6 to form a high-beam light pattern Hi.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Compared with the prior art, the vehicle lamp module of the present disclosure has at least the following advantages:<br/>
The vehicle lamp module according to the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1 to 11</figref>, includes a low beam reflector 2, a high beam condenser 4, a lens 6, a low beam circuit board 1 provided with a low beam light source 1a, and a high beam circuit board 3 provided with a high beam light source 3a. The low beam reflector 2 serves as a primary optical element for a low beam, and the high beam condenser 4 serves as a primary optical element for a high beam. When viewed as shown, for example, in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1 or FIG. 2</figref>, the low beam circuit board 1 is arranged at a position below the low beam reflector 2, and the optical center of the low beam light source 1a is located at the first focus 10 of the low beam reflector 2. The high beam condenser 4 is arranged at a position in front of the low beam circuit board 1, and a light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser is located at the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2. There is a distance less than or equal to 2 mm between the position of an upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 in a front-to-rear direction. Optionally, there is a distance of 0 mm between the position of the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 in the front-to-rear direction. In other words, the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 is located on the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser. Such structural arrangement allows for increased optical efficiency. The upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser is shaped like a low beam cut-off line so as to be configured to intercept low-beam light to create a low-beam light pattern. The lens 6 is arranged at a position in front of the high beam condenser 4 and configured to receive light travelling from the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser 4. Light emitted from the low beam light source 1a is reflected by the low beam reflector 2 and then is directed to the lens 6 over the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> refracted by the lens 6 to form a low-beam light pattern. Light emitted from the high beam light source 3a is refracted and reflected by the high beam condenser 4 and then exits from the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and is directed to the lens 6 and refracted by the lens 6 to form a high-beam light pattern Hi. It can be seen from this analysis that the vehicle lamp module according to the present disclosure can exhibit a uniform low beam, good high-beam lighting performance, and good high beam/low beam switching performance, because the low beam reflector 2 is provided as a primary optical element with a low-beam function, and the high beam condenser 4 is provided as a primary optical element with a high-beam function. Moreover, the vehicle lamp module consists of a small number of components, has a simple structure, and involves low cost. Due to the structural design of the low beam reflector 2 and the high beam condenser 4, a small spatial size is occupied by the optical elements of the vehicle lamp module as a whole. In summary, the vehicle lamp module according to the present disclosure can exhibit a uniform light pattern and excellent low-beam visibility due to the proper arrangement of the optical elements and the parametric design of each optical element, and the vehicle lamp module has a relatively simple structure, a lighter weight, a smaller size and lower cost and has good overall performance.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">It should be additionally noted here that the front-to-rear direction in the present disclosure is a direction of emission of light from the vehicle lamp module, i.e., the optical axis direction of the lens 6; and the top-to-bottom direction is the same as the direction of gravity. In addition, a reflector is selected and used as the primary optical element for a low beam because the reflector provides a more uniform light pattern than a condenser, and the reflector designed with a proper optical surface can also provide better low-beam visibility. The primary optical element for a high beam is a condenser, namely, the high beam condenser 4 in the components constituting the vehicle lamp module assembly. The condenser is selected and used as the primary optical element for a high beam because the condenser can provide a high beam with better optical performance than the reflector.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In the present disclosure, the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser is shaped like a low beam cut-off line and configured to intercept low-beam light to create a low-beam light pattern. In the prior art, a low beam cut-off line is generally formed by intercepting light with a structure having a cut-off line shape. In the present disclosure, the shape of the low beam cut-off line is made on the high beam condenser 4, which is advantageous in that the optical elements are assembled with high accuracy and the vehicle lamp module is obtained with a simple structure and low cost.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, optionally, the low beam reflector 2 is substantially in the shape of an arcuate plate and has a regular structure which can be easily<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> machined and manufactured. The low beam reflector 2 has an inner concave surface 21 and an outer convex surface 22 opposite to each other, and the inner concave surface 21 faces the lens 6. The inner concave surface 21 of the low beam reflector 2 is provided with a first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and a second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector. When viewed as shown, for example, in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is provided at a position on the lower side of the low beam reflector 2. In other words, the inner concave surface 21 includes a first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and a second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector connected to each other. The first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector extends to one edge of the low beam reflector 2 at a side away from the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector, and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector extends to the other opposite edge of the low beam reflector 2 at a side away from the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector. Optionally, the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is recessed in a direction toward the outer convex surface 22 from the inner concave surface 21 relative to the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector. In other words, the inner concave surface 21 of the low beam reflector 2 is formed as a stepped structure, the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is located on a lower side of the stepped structure, and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector is located on a higher side of the stepped structure. In this way, the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector are blocked from each other and are less likely to interfere with each other, which facilitates the travelling of light. Optionally, both the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector may be elliptical surfaces, and the area of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector occupies 10% or less of the total area of the low beam reflector 2. Optionally, the area of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector occupies 7% of the total area of the low beam reflector 2, where the total area refers to the surface area of the inner concave surface 21.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Optionally, both the surfaces of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector are subjected to aluminizing treatment and are aluminized to have a reflectivity greater than or equal to 0.8. Referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>, the first focus 10 of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is set at the optical center of the low beam light source 1a. The second focus 11 of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is set on the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser, and there is a distance less than or equal to 2 mm between the position of the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector in the front-to-rear direction. Optionally, there is a distance of 0 mm between the position of the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and the second focus 11 of the low beam reflector 2 in the front-to-rear direction. The second focus 11 of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is located on the upper side boundary 401 of the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser. This arrangement allows an increase in optical efficiency and also an increase in the light pattern brightness of the low-beam light pattern at 75R and in its vicinity. Referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 9</figref>, light emitted from the low beam light source 1a is reflected by the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector and then is directed to the lens 6 over the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and refracted by the lens 6 to form a first low-beam light pattern region Lo1. The first low-beam light pattern region Lo1 consists of the regulated test point 75R and its vicinal region below the low beam cut-off line, which can increase the low-beam visibility. The light emitted from the low beam light source 1a is reflected by the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector and then is directed to the lens 6 over the light exiting surface 4d of the high beam condenser and refracted by the lens 6 to form a second low-beam light pattern region Lo2. The second low-beam light pattern region Lo2 is a widened or expanded region below the low beam cut-off line. The second low-beam light pattern region Lo2 and the first low-beam light pattern region Lo1 partially overlap each other, which can increase a low-beam irradiation range. In the present disclosure, optionally, the first low-beam light pattern region Lo1 wholly falls within the second low-beam light pattern region Lo2.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">It should be additionally noted here that the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is provided at a position on the lower side of the low beam reflector 2. The first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector may be an elliptical surface and occupy 10% or less of the total area of the low beam reflector 2. Optionally, the area of the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector occupies 7% of the total area of the low beam reflector 2. The reflecting surface of the low beam reflector 2 is designed as above because the reflecting surface region on the lower side of the low beam reflector 2 close to the low beam light source 1a mainly creates a low-beam light pattern at 75R and in its vicinity, while the other reflecting surface regions mainly create a widened low-beam light pattern. As the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is provided close to the low beam light source 1a and has a defined area, the brightness of the low-beam light pattern at 75R and in its vicinity can be increased, whereby the low-beam visibility can be increased.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Optionally, the low beam light source 1a includes an LED, and the bottom surface of the low beam light source 1a forms an angle α relative to the front-to-rear direction.

In the present disclosure, α ≤ 30°, and optionally, α is 21°. The angle between the low beam reflector 2 and the horizontal plane is equal to the angle α. As the low beam light source 1a and the low beam reflector 2 are inclined upward at a certain angle, more light can be directed into the lens 6 to increase the optical efficiency of the low beam, and chromatic dispersion at the cut-off line of the low beam can also be ameliorated.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Optionally, the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is polished; and the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector is not polished. Such design is made because the first reflecting surface region 2a of the low beam reflector is provided to increase the low-beam visibility and the visibility can be further increased by a polishing treatment, while the second reflecting surface region 2b of the low beam reflector is provided to widen a low-beam light pattern, and the uniformity of the widened light pattern can be optimized without a polishing treatment so that a driver can get a good visual experience.</p>
