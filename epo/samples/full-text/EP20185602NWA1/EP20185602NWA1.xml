<p id="pa01" num="0001">The flexible display device includes a body, a flexible display, and a camera. The body includes a first body and a second body. The second body performs reciprocating movement relative to the first body between a first position and a second position. An area of the flexible display viewed from the front is larger when the second body is at the second position than when the second body is at the first position. When the second body is at the first position, the distance from a support to an edge of a third region is greater than the distance from the support to the camera. Accordingly, a range (stroke) of movement of the second body relative to the first body can be increased. In addition, when the second body is at the second position, the area of the flexible display viewed from the front can be increased.

<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h0002">1. Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a display device equipped with a flexible display and a camera.</p>
<heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">With the development of flexible displays that are bendable while displaying image information thereon, studies are being conducted and developments are being made regarding a foldable type device in which a flexible display is applied to a device having two bodies and folding structures (for example, hinge units). In such a device, since the flexible display may be entirely disposed on the two bodies via a folding structure, a large sized display may be implemented in the device.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">As another device using a flexible display, a rollable device having a structure in which a display is rolled has been studied and developed. In such a device, as the flexible display is rolled, the total size or area of the display may be reduced. Conversely, as the flexible display is unrolled, the size or area of the display may be increased.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As still another device using a flexible display, a device has been introduced in which, as the two bodies perform sliding movement relative to each other, the flexible display having a U-shape according to a curved middle part is modified such that an area of the display viewed from either side changes.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">As one prior document using a flexible display in this regard, Korean Patent Registration No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR1107127"><text>1107127</text></patcit> (hereinafter referred to as 'Related Art') discloses a mobile terminal that includes a terminal body, a sliding member, a flexible display, and a rotation axis.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The mobile terminal according to the Related Art may be maintained in a relatively small size in a state in which the sliding member is not withdrawn from the terminal body,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> but may form a display of a relatively large screen by being maintained in a relatively large size in a state in which the sliding member is withdrawn from the terminal body.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Smartphones, which constitute the majority of mobile phones, are configured to have various functions. For this, smartphones include, for example, various sensors and cameras. In recent years, various smartphones equipped with a flexible display have also been introduced.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a constant need for development of a device (smartphone) that may have various functions, may be small in size so as to be portable, and may implement a large-screen display as needed.</p>
<heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p0106" num="0106">The broadcast signal may be encoded according to at least one of technical standards (or broadcast schemes, for example, ISO, IEC, DVB, or ATSC) for transmitting and receiving a digital broadcast signal, and the broadcast receiving module 111 may receive the digital broadcast signal using an appropriate method for the technical specification defined by the technical standards.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">The broadcast-related information may refer to information related to a broadcast channel, a broadcast program, or a broadcast service provider. The broadcast-related information may also be provided over the mobile communication network. In this case, the broadcast-related information may be received by the mobile communication module 112.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">The broadcast-related information may exist in various types, such as an electronic program guide (EPG) of a digital multimedia broadcast (DMB) or an electronic service guide (ESG) of a digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H). The broadcast signal and/or the broadcast-related information received by the broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in the memory 170.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">The mobile communication module 112 may transmit/receive a wireless signal to/from at least one of a base station, an external terminal, or a server over a mobile<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> communication network established according to the technical standards or communication methods for mobile communication (for example, Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), Code Division Multi Access (CDMA), Code Division Multi Access 2000 (CDMA2000), Enhanced Voice-Data Optimized or Enhanced Voice-Data Only (EV-DO), Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A).)</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">The wireless signal may include a voice call signal, a video call signal, or various types of data in accordance with transmission or reception of a text/multimedia message.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">The wireless internet module 113 refers to a module for wireless internet connection, and may be embodied in the mobile terminal 100 or installed at the outside of the mobile terminal 100. The wireless internet module 113 may be configured to transmit/receive a wireless signal over a communication network according to wireless internet technologies.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">The wireless internet technologies include, for example, wireless LAN (WLAN), wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Wi-Fi direct, digital living network alliance (DLNA), wireless broadband (WiBro), world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), long term evolution (LTE), and long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A). The wireless internet module 113 may transmit or receive data in accordance with at least one wireless internet technology within a range including internet technology that have not been described above.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">From the viewpoint that the wireless internet connection through, for example, WiBro, HSDPA, HSUPA, GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE, and LTE-A is performed over the mobile communication network, the wireless internet module 113 that performs the wireless internet connection over the mobile communication network may be understood as a type of the mobile communication module 112.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">The near field communication module 114 is for short range communication, and may support the short range communication using at least one of Bluetooth™, radio<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> frequency identification (RFID), infrared data association (IrDA), ultra-wideband (UWB), ZigBee, Near Field Communication (NFC), wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Wi-Fi Direct, or Wireless Universal Serial Bus (Wireless USB). The near field communication module 114 may support wireless communication between the mobile terminal 100 and the wireless communication system, between the mobile terminal 100 and the other mobile terminal 100, or between the mobile terminal 100 and a network in which the other mobile terminal 100 (or external server) is located, over the wireless local area network. The wireless local area network may be a wireless personal area network.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">Here, the other mobile terminal 100 may be a wearable device (for example, a smart watch, a smart glass, or a head mounted display (HMD)) that is capable of exchanging data (or interworking) with the mobile terminal 100 according to the present disclosure. The near field communication module 114 may detect (or recognize) the wearable device that is capable of communicating with the mobile terminal 100, in the vicinity of the mobile terminal 100. Moreover, when the detected wearable device is authenticated to communicate with the mobile terminal 100 according to the present disclosure, the controller 180 may transmit at least a portion of data processed in the mobile terminal 100 to the wearable device through the near field communication module 114. Therefore, the user of the wearable device may use the data processed in the mobile terminal 100, through the wearable device. For example, according to this, when a phone call is received by the mobile terminal 100, the user may make a phone call through the wearable device, or when a message is received by the mobile terminal 100, the user may check the received message through the wearable device.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">The position information module 115 is a module for obtaining a position (or a current position) of a mobile terminal, and its representative examples include a global positioning system (GPS) module or a wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) module. For example, when the GPS module is utilized, the mobile terminal may obtain the position of the mobile terminal using a signal transmitted from the GPS satellite. As another example, when the Wi-Fi module is utilized, the mobile terminal may obtain the position of the mobile terminal based on information on a wireless access point (AP) that transmits and<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> receives wireless signals with the Wi-Fi module. If necessary, the position information module 115 may alternatively or additionally perform a function of another module of the wireless transceiver 110 to obtain data on the position of the mobile terminal. The position information module 115 is a module used to obtain the position (or the current position) of the mobile terminal, and is not limited to a module that directly calculates or obtains the position of the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">Next, the input interface 120 is for inputting video information (or signal), audio information (or signal), data, or information inputted by the user, and the mobile terminal 100 may include one or a plurality of cameras 122 to input the video information. The camera 122 processes an image frame such as a still or moving image obtained by an image sensor in a video call mode or a photographing mode. The processed image frame may be displayed on the display 151, or may be stored in the memory 170. Further, the plurality of cameras 122 included in the mobile terminal 100 may be arranged to form a matrix structure, and a plurality of pieces of image information having various angles or focal points may be inputted to the mobile terminal 100 through the cameras 122 that form the matrix structure. Further, the plurality of cameras 122 may be arranged to form a stereo structure to obtain left and right images used to implement a stereoscopic image.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">The microphone 121 processes an external sound signal as electrical voice data. The processed voice data may be utilized in various manners in accordance with the function (or an application program that is being executed) that is being performed by the mobile terminal 100. Various noise removal algorithms for removing noise generated during the process of receiving the external sound signal may be implemented in the microphone 121.</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">The user input interface 123 is for receiving information from the user, and when the information is inputted through the user input interface 123, the controller 180 may control the operation of the mobile terminal 100 so as to correspond to the inputted information. The user input interface 123 may include a mechanical input interface (or a mechanical key, for example, a button, a dome switch, a jog wheel, and a jog switch that are located on a front, rear, or side surface of the mobile terminal 100) and a touch type<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> input interface. For example, the touch type input interface may be formed as a virtual key, a soft key, or a visual key that is displayed on the touch screen through a software process, or a touch key that is disposed on a part other than the touch screen. The virtual key or visual key may be displayed on the touch screen in various shapes, and, for example, may be formed as graphics, text, icons, video, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">The sensor 140 senses at least one of information in the mobile terminal, surrounding environment information around the mobile terminal, or user information, and generates a sensing signal corresponding to the information. The controller 180 may control the driving or the operation of the mobile terminal 100 or perform data processing, functions, or operations related to the application program installed in the mobile terminal 100, based on the sensing signal. Representative sensors among various sensors that may be included in the sensor 140 will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">First, the proximity sensor 141 refers to a sensor that senses the presence of an object approaching a predetermined sensing surface or nearby objects, using an electromagnetic field force or infrared ray without any mechanical contact. The proximity sensor 141 may be disposed in an internal area of the mobile terminal that is enclosed by the above-described touch screen or in the vicinity of the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">Examples of the proximity sensor 141 may include, for example, a transmission type photoelectric sensor, a direct reflection type photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflection type photoelectric sensor, a high frequency oscillation type proximity sensor, a capacitive proximity sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, and an infrared proximity sensor. When the touch screen is a capacitive type, the proximity sensor 141 may be configured to detect the proximity of an object with a change in the electric field in accordance with the proximity of the object having conductivity. In this case, the touch screen (or the touch sensor) itself may be classified as a proximity sensor.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">For convenience of description, when the object approaches the touch screen without contacting the touch screen, and it is recognized that the object is located over the touch screen, it is referred to as a "proximity touch". When the object actually touches the touch screen, it is referred to as a "contact touch". A position at which the object<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> proximately touches the touch screen refers to a position at which the object vertically corresponds to the touch screen when the object proximately touches the touch screen. The proximity sensor 141 may sense the proximity touch and a proximity touch pattern (for example, a proximate touch distance, a proximate touch direction, a proximate touch speed, a proximate touch time, a proximate touch position, and a proximate touch movement state). As described above, the controller 180 may process data (or information) corresponding to the proximate touch operation and the proximate touch pattern sensed by the proximity sensor 141, and may further display visual information corresponding to the processed data on the touch screen. Furthermore, the controller 180 may control the mobile terminal 100 to process different operations or data (or information) depending on whether the touch on the same point on the touch screen is the proximity touch or the contact touch.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">The touch sensor senses a touch (or a touch input) applied to the touch screen (or the display 151) using at least one of various touch types such as a resistive film type, a capacitive type, an infrared type, an ultrasonic type, and a magnetic field type.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">For example, the touch sensor may be configured to convert a change in a pressure applied to a specific portion of the touch screen, or a capacitance generated in a specific portion, into an electrical input signal. The touch sensor may be configured to detect a position and area where a touch subject that applies a touch onto the touch screen is touched on the touch sensor, and a pressure and capacitance at the time of the touch. Here, the touch subject is an object that applies a touch to the touch sensor, and may include, for example, a finger, a touch pen, a stylus pen, and a pointer.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">As described above, when there is the touch input to the touch sensor, corresponding signal(s) is transmitted to a touch controller. The touch controller processes the signal(s) and then transmits corresponding data to the controller 180. By doing this, the controller 180 may confirm which area of the display 151 is touched. Here, the touch controller may be a separate component from the controller 180, or may be the controller 180 itself.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">The controller 180 may perform different control or the same control depending on a type of a touch subject that touches the touch screen (or a touch key provided other<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> than the touch screen). Whether to perform the different or the same control depending on the type of touch subject may be determined in accordance with an operating state of the current mobile terminal 100 or an application program that is being executed.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">The touch sensor and the proximity sensor that are described above may, independently or in combination, sense various types of touches on the touch screen, such as a short (or tap) touch, a long touch, a multi touch, a drag touch, a flick touch, a pinch-in touch, a pinch-out touch, a swipe touch, or a hovering touch.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">The ultrasonic sensor may recognize position information on a sensing object using an ultrasonic wave. The controller 180 may calculate a position of a wave generating source by using information sensed by the optical sensor and the plurality of ultrasonic sensors. The position of the wave generating source may be calculated using the property that light is much faster than the ultrasonic wave, that is, the time in which light reaches the optical sensor is much faster than the time in which the ultrasonic wave reaches the ultrasonic sensor. More specifically, the position of the wave generating source may be calculated using a time difference of the time of arrival of the ultrasonic wave with respect to light that serves as a reference signal.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">As seen from the configuration of the input interface 120, the camera 122 includes at least one of a camera sensor (for example, a CCD and a CMOS), a photo sensor (or an image sensor), or a laser sensor.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">The camera 122 and the laser sensor may be combined to sense a touch of a sensing object for a three-dimensional stereoscopic image.
