<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method and device for increasing the reliability of a power module.</p>
<heading id="h0002">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The electrical interconnections of power semiconductors of a power module are one of the weakest points of the power module. The state of electrical interconnections of power semiconductors is one of the factors that determines the power module end of life. Each power semiconductor is classically connected to the external pins of the package of the power module using wire bonding techniques. In the wire bonding process, a wire is bonded to the metallized power semiconductor surface and a metallized substrate using force, temperature and ultrasonic energy. These techniques normally result in a microscopic difference between the wire bond and the metallization that causes reliability issues.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">During wire bonding process, the structure wire/metallization becomes harder and limits the amount of deformation that can be obtained before the breaking of the wire bond.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The region that is constituted by the wire bonded to the metallized power semiconductor surface undergoes mechanical stress caused by different thermal coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), CTEs of the structure composing the power module packaging. Similar phenomena of hardening appear during the lifetime of the wire bonding/metallization contact. The thermomechanical stress associated to a hard material contributes to the crack formation on the bond between the wire bond and the metallization which finally results to a complete lift-off of the wire bond that can lead to the failure of the power module.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Today's techniques to increase the reliability of that type of interconnection include the use of Aluminium wires and more recently Silver or Copper wires.</p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention aims to provide a device and a method for increasing the reliability of a power module.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">To that end, the present invention concerns a device for increasing the reliability of a power module composed of plural power semiconductors that are connected in parallel, the power semiconductors being connected to the external pins of the package of the power module through metallic connections, characterized in that the device comprises:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>means for selecting one power semiconductor among the power semiconductors connected in parallel according to a criterion,</li>
<li>means for applying a same input pattern to the not selected power semiconductors connected in parallel,</li>
<li>means for increasing the temperature of the selected power semiconductor in order to reach a target temperature of the power semiconductor during a time duration in order to achieve and interface grain homogenisation of the metallic connections of the selected power semiconductor,</li>
<li>means for applying the same input pattern to the selected power semiconductor after the time duration.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention concerns also a method for increasing the reliability of a power module composed of plural power semiconductors that are connected in parallel, the power semiconductors being connected to the external pins of the package of the power module through metallic connections, characterized in that the method comprises the steps of:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>selecting one power semiconductor among the power semiconductors connected in parallel according to a criterion,</li>
<li>applying a same input pattern to the not selected power semiconductors connected in parallel,</li>
<li>increasing the temperature of the selected power semiconductor in order to reach a target temperature of the power semiconductor during a time duration in order to achieve and interface grain homogenisation of the metallic connections of the selected power semiconductor,</li>
<li>applying the same input pattern to the selected power semiconductor after the time duration.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, the lifetime of the power module is increased by changing the microstructure and increasing the grain-size on the metallic connection structure of the selected power semiconductor thanks to the heat treatment. Consequently, a softer and more ductile metallic connection and interface is obtained that can support a large<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> deformation caused by the temperature and the mismatched CTE of the different materials present on the power module structure. As the temperature on the power module imposes a given strain, the soft materials obtained according to the present invention present an increase of the reliability. The classical materials and techniques of metallic connextions can be used with this method with an increase on the reliability and lifetime of the power module. The total power requested to increase the temperature of the selected power semiconductor is only a fraction of the total dissipated losses of the entire power module.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a particular feature, the criterion is the age of the metallic connection, wherein the power semiconductor with a recent metallic connection is inserted in a queue.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, the fine and poorly sorted grain size on the metallic connection structure obtained during a classical process is modified in order to obtain a corser grain size and consequently a soft material that can support more deformation without cracks or fracture.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a particular feature, the criterion is the deterioration of the metallic connection of the power semiconductor, the deterioration being estimated by the evolution of the junction temperature during the operation of the power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, the process of grain homogenisation is repeated many times during the lifetime of the power module in order to relive the accumulated strain/stress on the metallic connection structure caused by the fatigue effects given the temperature swing during the operation of the power module.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a particular feature, the evolution of the junction temperature during the operation of the power semiconductor is estimated according to a rain flow algorithm that treats the historical data of the junction temperature in order to determine W different temperature levels with a number of cycles Ncw at a given temperature swing ΔTjw and at a given average temperature Tjw, combined with a linear accumulation rule based on a damage-law using the following formula: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mrow><munderover><mrow><mo>∑</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>W</mi></munderover></mrow></mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mi mathvariant="italic">Ncw</mi><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">Tjw</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>exp</mi><mfenced><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">Kc</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">Tjw</mi></mrow></mfrac></mfenced></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>≥</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="64" he="19" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where the coefficients A, α, Kc are previously determined with power cycling tests.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Thus, the process of grain homogenisation is only applied when the evolution of the grain structure becomes critical to the crack formation based on the knowledge of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the grain evolution determined by previous power cycling tests and the actual historical stress level imposed on the power module by the temperature swing.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">According to a particular feature, the time duration varies from 2 hours and up to 78 hours.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Thus, the microstructure of the metallic connection is modified by annealing effect at relative low temperature and the duration is relatively small.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a particular feature, the target temperature is smaller than the maximum junction temperature and smaller than the melting temperature of the power semiconductor interconnection.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, the power semiconductor can be operational during the grain interface homogenisation and any especial support is necessary to maintain the die in place during this heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a particular feature, the increase of the temperature of the selected power semiconductor is performed by inducing and controlling a leakage current of a power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Thus, the heat treatment is controlled on each power semiconductor during the normal operation with unchanged power module output waveforms (voltage/current), only few amperes are enough to increase the temperature given the other parallel power seminconductors are blocking the BUS voltage (V+ - V-).</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a particular feature, the leakage current is induced by increasing the gate to source or emitter voltage of the power semiconductor to a value that is comprised between 100mV and 2V above the threshold voltage value of the selected power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, the heat treatment controller may be integrated on the classical control unit of the selected power semiconductor given the compatibility of the voltage levels.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a particular feature, the gate to source or emitter voltage of the power semiconductor obtained using a pulse width modulator, the frequency of which is defined as: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">F</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">PWM</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">90</mn></mrow></msub><mo>≥</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Vcc</mi><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Vee</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn mathvariant="bold">0.1</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">π</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Cin</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Rg</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="60" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where Cin is the input capacitance of the power semiconductor, Rg is the sum of a resistance connected to the gate and an input resistance of the power semiconductor<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and Vcc and Vee are the positive and negative voltage rails of a gate driver that drives the power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Thus, a fully digital voltage regulator may be implemented using the classical hardware of a gate driver and the peak to peak ripple of the leakage current is inferior to 100mV.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a particular feature, the gate to source or emitter voltage of the power semiconductor obtained using a pulse width modulator, the frequency of which is defined as: <maths id="math0003" num=""><math display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">F</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">PWM</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1000</mn></mrow></msub><mo>≥</mo><mfrac><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">VgL</mi><mrow><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn mathvariant="bold">0.1</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">π</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Cin</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Rg</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Rgl</mi></mfenced></mrow></mfrac><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="59" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/></maths> where Cin is the input capacitance of the power semiconductor and Rg is the sum of a resistance connected to the gate and an input resistance of the power semiconductor, VgL is a voltage imposed across two switches that are controlled according to the pulse width modulator and that are linked through respective resistors to the positive and negative voltage rails of a gate driver that drives the power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Thus, the voltage applied to the gate driver may be reduced and/or the gate resistance may be increased during the controlled leakage mode, the frequency of the PWM modulator may be reduced reducing the losses on the gate driver switches and passive elements.</p>

<p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> represents an example of a power module comprising plural power semiconductors.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In the example of <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a power module is composed of a plurality of semiconductors noted D<sub>1,1</sub> to D<sub>1,N</sub> and D<sub>2,1</sub> to D<sub>2,N</sub> where N is generally upper than four. The semiconductors noted D<sub>1,1</sub> to D<sub>1,N</sub> are connected in parallel and the semiconductors noted D<sub>2,1</sub> to D<sub>2,N</sub> are connected in parallel.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The power semiconductors D<sub>1,1</sub> to D<sub>1,N</sub> and D<sub>2,1</sub> to D<sub>2,N</sub> are connected to the external pins of the package of the power module through metallic connections.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The metallic connections are wire bonds and/or metallic vias and/or metallic ribbons and/or direct lead bonding and/or conductive fills.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The present invention is disclosed in an example wherein metallic connections are wire bonds. The same can be applied to metallic vias and/or metallic ribbons and/or direct lead bonding and/or conductive fills.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Considering 20 bonds per semiconductor, the total number of wire bonding connection is extremely high.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Each wire bond being a weakness on the structure of the entire power module, the increase of the number of bonds results in a reduction of the reliability of the power<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> module. During the lifetime of the power module, the cracks appear on the bond region caused by the thermomechanical stress as shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idref="f0001"><b>Fig. 2</b></figref> represents an example of a crack formation on a wire bonded to a metallized power semiconductor surface.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a wire bond Bd is bonded to a metallized surface Me of a power semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> with i=1 or 2 and j=1 to N.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Cracks Cra and Crb appear on the bond region caused by the thermomechanical stress.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The power module is not composed by materials having the same CTE. Classically, a power semiconductor in Si has a linear CTE of 2.56e<sup>-6</sup>/K and is metallized with aluminium having a CTE of 23.1e<sup>-6</sup>/K. Furthermore, the temperature is not homogenous on the power semiconductor. As consequence, a mechanical deformation appears on the bond structure. The fatigue effects on the bond associated to the temperature swing during the operation result in cracks Cra and Crb that induce the wire-bonding lift-off.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">The present invention aims at increasing the temperature of one power semiconductor among the power semiconductors of the power module to a temperature close to the maximum junction temperature of the power semiconductor during the operation of the power module for a duration necessary to achieve interface grain homogenisation. The temperature increase of the power semiconductor is obtained by inducing and controlling a controlled leakage current of the power semiconductor. By consequence, the losses in the power semiconductor increase then the temperature, thus the microstructure of the wire bond is modified by an annealing effect which increases the softness of the wire bond structure and increases its capability to endure deformation contributing to increase the lifetime of the entire power module.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idref="f0002"><b>Fig. 3</b></figref> represents an example of architecture of a device for increasing the reliability of a power module according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The device 100 has, for example, an architecture based on components connected together by a bus 301 and a processor 300 controlled by a program.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">The bus 301 links the processor 300 to a read only memory ROM 302, a random access memory RAM 303, and an input output I/O interface I/F 305.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">The memory 303 contains registers intended to receive variables and the instructions of the program related to the algorithm disclosed in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">The read-only memory, or possibly a flash memory 302, contains instructions of the program related to the algorithm disclosed in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">When the device 100 is powered on, the instructions stored in the memory 302 are transferred to the random access memory 303.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idref="f0002"><b>Fig. 4</b></figref> represents an example of an algorithm for increasing the reliability of a power module according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The present algorithm is disclosed in an example wherein it is executed by the processor 300.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">At step S40, the processor 300 selects one power semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> among the power semiconductors of the power module, with i=1 or 2 and j is an integer value comprised between 1 and N.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">For example, among the power semiconductors of the power module, a queue composed by the power semiconductors is established according to at least one criterion.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">For example, the criterion is the age of the wire bonding connection. The power semiconductor with a recent wire bonding interconnection is inserted in the queue.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">For example, the criterion is the deterioration of the wire bonding interconnection of a power semiconductor. The deterioration of the wire bonding interconnection may be estimated by the evolution of the junction temperature during the operation, for example, increase of more than 5% of the junction temperature in a given operation point or a given number of the junction temperature cycles, Nc.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The junction temperature may be measured using temperature sensors or Temperature Sensitive Electrical Parameters (TSEP) based techniques.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">For example, the criterion is based on the analysis of the historical data of the junction temperature. For example, the criterion is defined according to a rain flow algorithm that treats the historical data of the junction temperature in order to determine the W different temperature levels and the number of cycles Ncw at a given temperature swing ΔTjw and at a given average temperature Tjw, combined with a linear accumulation rule based on a damage-law, as shown in the following equation, where the coefficients A, α, Kc are previously determined with power cycling tests: <maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mrow><munderover><mrow><mo>∑</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>W</mi></munderover></mrow></mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mi mathvariant="italic">Ncw</mi><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">Tjw</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>exp</mi><mfenced><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">Kc</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">Tjw</mi></mrow></mfrac></mfenced></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>≥</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="70" he="19" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">For example, the processor 300 selects the power semiconductor on a round robin basis.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">At step S41, the processor 300 disables the input pattern that is classically applied to the selected power semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub>.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">At step S42, the processor 300 increases the temperature of the selected power semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> in order to reach a target temperature. The temperature control is performed only for one power semiconductor during the normal operation of the power module.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">The increase of the temperature of the selected power semiconductor is performed by inducing and controlling a leakage current of a power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The target power semiconductor temperature is slightly smaller than the maximum junction temperature and smaller than the melting temperature of the power semiconductor interconnections. The time duration of the leakage current control is determined in order to achieve interface grain homogenisation as it will be described in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 6b</figref>. The time duration is, for example, obtained by experimental test on the wire bonding and metallization structure in a development phase. The time duration may vary from 2 hours and up to 78 hours.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The leakage current is induced by increasing the gate to source/emitter voltage to a value that is comprised between 100mV to 2V above the threshold voltage value of the selected power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">As a result, a leakage current flows in the selected power semiconductor when the other power semiconductors are blocking the bus voltage V+, V- shown in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Thus, only few amperes are enough to heat the selected power semiconductor. The temperature may be classically controlled by a feedback control system.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">Once the time duration ends, the processor 300 moves to step S43.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">At step S43, the processor enables the input pattern INi for the selected power semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> and checks if there is another power semiconductor in the queue.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">If there is at least one other power semiconductor in the queue, the processor 300 returns to step S400 and selects the following power semiconductor in the queue.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idref="f0003"><b>Fig. 5</b></figref> represents an example of signals that are applied to a selected power semiconductor according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">During normal operation, the same input pattern INi is applied to the power semiconductors that are connected in parallel. The applied input pattern INi is for example a signal having a period T<sub>sw</sub> of several micro seconds. When the power<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> is selected, the leakage current of the semiconductor D<sub>i,j</sub> is induced and controlled at step S42 during the duration noted T in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The leakage current is induced by increasing, using the signal Vctrl, the gate to source/emitter voltage to a value higher, but close to the threshold voltage Vth of the selected power semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">As a result, a leakage current will flow in the selected power semiconductor when the other power semiconductor are blocking the bus voltage V+, V-.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">The junction temperature of the selected power semiconductor is increased to the target temperature.</p>

<p id="p0071" num="0071">After the process of bonding or during the operation of the power module, the wire-bonding chemical characteristics as depicted in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 6a</figref> exists. A fine and poorly sorted grain size on the wire-bonding structure is obtained as shown in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 6a</figref>. This results in a hard material having a fine granularity, and a yield point and an ultimate strength, fracture, which occurs at a small amount of strain.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idref="f0003">Fig. 6b</figref> represents crystallographic characteristics of a wire bonding connexion to a metallization surface of a power semiconductor after an increase of the reliability of a power module according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The soft materials, as shown in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 6b</figref> have a yield point and an ultimate strength, fracture, which occurs at a large amount of strain. After the application of the thermal treatment according to the invention, the granularity is coarser. As the temperature on the power module imposes a given strain, the soft materials obtained according to the present invention present an increase of the reliability.</p>
