<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a system for assembling a generator, preferably a permanently excited generator of a wind turbine, comprising a rotor and a stator.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Systems for assembling a generator of a wind turbine, preferably a permanently excited generator of a wind turbine, are generally known in the prior art. In this regard, the term permanently excited generator relates to a generator at which the magnetic field is at least partially generated by permanent magnets. Permanently excited generators typically require a precise assembling routine. It is crucial to exactly align the main components, rotor and stator, with respect to each other and guide the rotor into the stator or the stator upon the rotor under exact guidance to avoid excessive magnetic forces that might occur in case rotor and stator approach each other to closely during assembling. In order to achieve this, assembly arrangements that are configured to assist in the aligning procedure are known from the prior art.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2667493B1"><text>EP 2 667 493 B1</text></patcit> relates to an assembly arrangement for use in the vertical assembly of a generator of a wind turbine. The assembly arrangement comprises an assembly support onto which a rotor is placed. The stator is guided into the rotor and aligned relative to the rotor by means of spacer blocks. After arranging the stator in the rotor, permanent magnets are mounted to the rotor.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The proposed solution requires the installation of magnets after the assembly of the rotor and the stator. This, however, requires an exact alignment of the magnets which can only be achieved properly in controlled environments, such as assembly- or manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2299560B1"><text>EP 2 299 560 B1</text></patcit> proposes the use of temporarily installed guiding rings for a synchronous machine, wherein the guiding rings are arranged at a stator and a rotor prior to guiding the rotor into the stator. However, the guiding rings need to be removed after assembly, which is difficult to achieve due to their rather poor accessibility.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Consequently, in the state of the art, generators are mounted at assembly- or manufacturing facilities in controlled environments and are transported to the installation site of the wind turbine afterwards. However, one of the drawbacks of this is that due to the excessive weight of such generators, transporting the assembled generator to the installation site is often challenging and costly.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, it was an object of the invention to provide a system for assembling a generator that overcomes at least some of the above-mentioned issues. In particular, it was an object of the invention to provide a system for assembling a generator that allows for a flexible assembling of the generator components, even directly at the installation site of a wind turbine.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the invention, a vertical assembly device being connectable to the rotor and the stator is proposed, for guiding the rotor in parallel and coaxially aligned to the stator during assembly, the vertical assembly device comprising: a first assembly element being connectable to the rotor, a second assembly element being connectable to the stator, and guiding means for guiding the first assembly element coaxially aligned to the second assembly element.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Compared to known solutions, such a vertical assembly device allows for a location-independent assembly of the generator components. The system may be used in an assembly- or manufacturing facility but also directly at an installation site of a wind turbine. The first assembly element, the second assembly element and the guiding means are separate parts. The guiding means ensure an exact guidance of the two components rotor and stator relative to one another in parallel and coaxially aligned. An air gap between rotor and stator is kept at a constant level at all times avoiding excessive magnetic forces to arise during assembly. The vertical assembly device can be connected to the components<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of a generator on site and can easily be removed after the assembly process. One assembling system can therefore be used for a plurality of generator assembly processes. Hence, for example, only one assembling system is required for the installation of several identical generators of a whole wind farm and may easily be transported to different locations.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the system further comprises a driving means that is configured to vertically move the first assembly element and the second assembly element relative to one another. According to a preferred embodiment, the driving means comprises one or more hydraulic cylinders. In case more than one hydraulic drive is used, a closed loop position control may be utilized to differentially operate the hydraulic drives to provide advanced aligning capabilities. With the help of this, the alignment between rotor and stator may be improved further.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment, the hydraulic cylinders are double-acting hydraulic cylinders. It is furthermore preferred that the rotor comprises a bearing with the help of which the stator is screwed or bolted together after assembling.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">In yet another preferred embodiment, the first assembly element is permanently connected to the second assembly element.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, the second assembly element comprises an outer tube and the first assembly element comprises an inner tube that is coaxially arranged and longitudinally movable within the outer tube. In this regard, the expression "longitudinally" refers to the direction along the longitudinal axis of the outer tube. This setup helps to provide an exact alignment between the components of the vertical assembly device and the generator components itself. Through this, a tilting of the components is inhibited.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">According to yet another embodiment, the guiding means comprises a linear guide that is configured to inhibit a rotation of the first assembly element and the second assembly element relative to one another. Especially for assembling permanently excited generators, it is not only required to provide a tilt-free guidance of the rotor and the stator, but also to establish and maintain a certain relative angular position between the components. It has been found to be beneficial to establish this utilizing a linear guide.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an alternative embodiment, the linear guide comprises a radially adjustable linear guide that is configured to fine-tune the positioning of the rotor and the stator relative<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> to one another in the radial direction. Such an adjustable linear guide increases the capabilities for fine tuning the relative positioning and guiding of the stator relative to the rotor even more.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the linear guide comprises angular guiding elements arranged on one of the first assembly element or the second assembly element and an angular guide arranged on the other of the first assembly element or the second assembly element, and configured to receive the angular guiding elements. This has been found as an easy to manufacture and handle way of establishing the linear guiding. It also enables a release of the first and second assembly element and a connecting of the components during the assembling process, e.g. in case the stator is provided by a lifting crane. In yet another embodiment, sliding pads are arranged between the first assembly element and the second assembly element.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">According to an alternative embodiment, the system comprises a support means that are configured to hold at least one of the rotor or the stator.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">It is furthermore preferred that the support means comprises a rotor support and a stator support configured to coaxially hold the stator above the rotor. This allows a pre-aligning of the two components simplifying the setup of the vertical assembly device.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably, the rotor support and the stator support are arranged on a common platform. This is especially important when assembling the generator onsite and on uneven ground.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a preferred embodiment, the system comprises spacing means that are configured to be temporarily arranged in an air gap between the rotor and the stator for guiding the rotor relative to the stator during lifting and assembling. With the help of this the alignment of rotor and stator is improved further.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, the spacing means are selected from the following list: Sliding plates arranged at the rotor, sliding plates arranged at the stator, guiding rollers, preferably adjustable guiding rollers, arranged at the stator. These devices have been found to be most suitable for the intended use.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In a preferred embodiment, the spacing means furthermore comprise a coating and/or intermediate layer for reducing friction, the coating and/or layer being arranged at the rotor,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the stator and/or the sliding plates. This allows a smoother transitioning of the components and an increased service life of the components.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">In another preferred embodiment, the system comprises three or more positioning means arranged equidistantly around a contact diameter of the rotor with the stator and configured to radially position the rotor in the stator, the positioning means comprising at least one of protective wedges or shim plates. These means have been found to improve the fine-tuning and alignment options when assembling the generator.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably, the stator support comprises a radially resilient support which avoids damages to the stator.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of assembling a generator, preferably a permanently excited generator of a wind turbine, wherein the generator comprises a rotor and a stator, by means of an assembling system according to any of the preceding claims. According to the invention, the method comprises the steps of connecting the first assembly element of the vertical assembly device to the rotor, connecting the second assembly element of the vertical assembly device to the stator, connecting the first assembly element to the second assembly element, and moving at least one of the stator or the rotor towards the other, wherein the vertical assembly device ensures that the rotor and stator are in parallel and coaxially aligned to one another during the movement.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The method takes advantage of the same benefits and preferred embodiments as the assembling system described hereinabove. In this regard, to avoid unnecessary repetition, reference is made to the above explanations.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In summary, the method enables a precise and location-independent assembly of a generator, which may even be performed directly at an installation site of a wind turbine. The method ensures an exact guidance of the two components rotor and stator relative to one another in parallel and coaxially aligned.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, the method further comprises the steps: removing the vertical assembly device, assembling the generator on a wind turbine. The vertical assembly device may afterwards be reused.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">It is moreover preferred that the method comprises: spacing the stator to the rotor by disposing spacing means in an air gap between the rotor and stator for guiding the rotor<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> relative to the stator, removing the spacing means after positioning the rotor within the stator. With the help of this the alignment of rotor and stator is improved further.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">According to yet another embodiment, the method further comprises radially positioning the rotor in the stator by using positioning means, preferably protective wedges or shim plates, arranged equidistantly around a contact diameter of the rotor with the stator. This provides another means for aligning and fine-tuning the relative positioning of the two components rotor and stator.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferably, the method further comprises arranging the rotor on a rotor support, arranging the stator on a stator support above and coaxially aligned to the rotor, lifting the rotor into the stator by using the driving means of the vertical assembly device. In this embodiment, the rotor is lifted into the stator by using the driving means of the vertical assembly device which has found to be a precise and reliable way of assembling the components.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">According to an alternative preferred embodiment, the method comprises lifting the stator above the rotor, preferably by means of a lifting crane, lowering the stator after connecting the first assembly element of the vertical assembly device to the second assembly element, for ensuring a parallel and aligned guidance of the stator to the rotor.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">According to yet another preferred embodiment, the method comprises permanently connecting the first assembly element to the second assembly element, lifting the stator above the rotor, preferably by means of a lifting crane, after connecting the second assembly element to the stator, lowering the stator, connecting the first assembly element to the rotor and further lowering the stator, for ensuring a parallel and aligned guidance of the stator to the rotor.
