<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present application relates to a tool for oral cavity cleaning, and in particular, to dental floss for cleaning a gap between teeth.</p>
<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Due to reasons such as aging, pathology, and the like, gingival atrophy is easily caused, and a gap between teeth is easily expanded, thereby causing food residues. If the residues are not cleaned in time, not only oral odor may be generated, but also various dental diseases, oral diseases, and especially periodontitis are easily caused.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Dental floss is an important interdental cleaning tool on the market. Although there are various products with different structures and specifications on the market, the existing products are generally difficult to observe the gap between teeth. Especially, when a gap between a third molar and a second molar, or a gap between the second molar and a first molar, or a gap between the first molar and the second molar is cleaned, because a position of the gap between the teeth to be cleaned is located deep in an oral cavity, light in a cleaned part is very dark. When there is no external lighting, a user can only operate by feeling, which will easily cause bleeding or damage to gums. Therefore, the existing dental floss needs to be improved.</p>
<heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Luminous dental floss of the present application is illuminated by a light source system to ensure that a cleaned part may be clearly observed in a cleaning process, thereby effectively preventing accidental damage to gums while ensuring the cleaning effect.</p>
