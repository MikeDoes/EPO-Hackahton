<heading id="h0006"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b></heading>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to examples thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, throughout which same or similar elements, or elements having same or similar functions, are denoted by same or similar reference numerals. The embodiments described below with reference to the drawings are illustrative only, and are intended to explain, rather than limiting, the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">A document marking method and device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the figures.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a document marking method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method can be executed by a document marking<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The document marking device can be installed in an electronic device such as a desktop computer, a notebook computer, a smart phone, and a tablet computer.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the document marking method includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">At block 101, a target document is parsed to determine information on each associated user corresponding to the target document.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Each associated user corresponding to the target document may be a collaborator of the target document, and/or a person or a group mentioned in the target document, and/or a person who has an access to the target document, etc. Information on each associated user includes but is not limited to an account of a user, an email address of the user, a company to which the user belongs, and a department in which the user works. User information can be entered by the user in accordance with his/her personal circumstances during registration.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, for a target document to be marked, the target document may be parsed to obtain the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, an operation record of a document usually records a user who edits the document, i.e., a collaborator, and records a user who browses the document, i.e., a reviewer. Therefore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the collaborator and the reviewer of the target document can be obtained from the operation record of the target document as associated users corresponding to the target document.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In addition, other users are often mentioned in the document, especially in a collaborative document. A current user may mention a user from another department or another company to remind other users to edit the document in a specific position. For example, user A can be reminded to supplement content in the document in a form of "@UserA" User A can be a name of an individual or a group name of a group. Therefore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, content of the target document can be parsed to determine whether another user is mentioned in the content of the target document. If so, another user mentioned in the content of the target document is also determined as an associated user corresponding to the target document.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Next, after obtaining the associated user corresponding to the target document, the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> information on each associated user may be further determined.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">As an example, each obtained associated user can be matched with a pre-established user registration information database. The user registration information database stores a corresponding relation between a name of each user and personal information filled in by each user during registration. When each associated user is matched from the user registration information database, the information on each associated user corresponding to each associated user can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">It is to be noted that when the associated user is a group, information of each user in the group is obtained as associated user information of the associated user.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">At block 102, an attribute of the target document is determined based on the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The attribute of the target document includes but is not limited to external (referring to an external company), inter-department (referring to different departments of the same company), intra-department (referring to internal disclosure of a department), and personal (referring to edition and reference available to an author only).</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, after the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document is determined, the attribute of the target document may be determined based on the information on each associated user.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">As an example, the attribute of the target document can be determined based on a mailbox in the information on each associated user. Mailboxes of users in the same company have the same suffix. For example, mailbox suffixes of all employees in ByteDance Technology Co., Ltd. are all "@bytedance.com". Therefore, it can be determined whether each associated user belongs to the same company according to a mailbox suffix. If in the information on each associated user, there is at least one associated user whose mailbox suffix is inconsistent with other associated users, the attribute of the target document is determined to be external.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">As an example, the attribute of the target document may be determined based on the company and department in the information on each associated user. If the information on each associated user includes different company names, i.e., respective associated users belong to different companies, the attribute of the target document is determined to be external. If each associated user belongs to the same company, it is further determined whether each associated<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> user belongs to the same department. If each associated user does not belong to the same department, the attribute of the target document is determined to be inter-department. If there are multiple associated users, and each associated user belongs to the same department, the attribute of the target document is determined to be intra-department. If the target document corresponds to one associated user, the attribute of the target document is determined to be personal.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">At block 103, the target document is marked based on the attribute of the target document.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, after the attribute of the target document is determined, the target document can be marked based on the attribute of the target document.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, marking the target document includes: marking the target document in a document list; and/or marking the target document at a document title of the target document; and/or marking the target document in a display page of a document search result. By marking the document, it is helpful for collaborators to determine the attribute of the document based on a mark when viewing and searching the document, thereby prompting the collaborators to be more cautious when creating an external document.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">As an example, if the attribute of the target document is external, the target document can be marked in the document list. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, assuming that the attribute of document 2 is external in a current document list, a mark "External" can be added to an upper right corner of document 2 for marking.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">With the document marking device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a target document is parsed to determine information on each associated user corresponding to the target document. An attribute of the target document is determined based on the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document. The target document is marked based on the attribute of the target document. Consequently, a document can be marked based on an attribute of the document to attract a user's attention, and to remind the user to pay attention to wording when editing the document, thereby improving information security.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> condition for parsing the target document may be preset. When the preset condition is met, the target document is parsed.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">As an example, the preset condition may be obtaining of a collaborative processing request. The collaborative processing request includes an identifier of the target document. Specifically, a function key of "Add a collaborator" can be set in a toolbar of a document editing interface. When the function key is triggered, the collaborative processing request is generated. The document marking device obtains the collaborative processing request. The target document is determined based on the identifier carried in the collaborative processing request, and is parsed.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">As an example, the preset condition is obtaining of a configuration information update request. The configuration information update request includes the identifier of the target document. Configuration information is an operation authority of a document. Generally, a default authority of the configuration information of the document is set to be operational to an owner only. When the user modifies the configuration information, the configuration information update request is generated. For example, when the user changes a setting of the configuration information from "Accessible/editable to me only" to "Accessible/editable to all users", a corresponding configuration information update request is generated. The document marking device obtains the configuration information update request, determines the target document corresponding to the identifier based on the identifier carried in the configuration information update request, and parses the target document.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, when the operation authority of the target document is obtained as "accessible/editable to all users", the attribute of the target document is determined to be external, and the target document is marked.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">As an example, the preset condition is obtaining of a preset operation request in a process of editing the target document. The preset operation request may be, for example, an operation request generated by triggering an "Insert" key in the toolbar of the document editing interface for inserting a link, a user, another document, and the like, or an operation request generated when inputting a preset symbol "@" for adding a user, another document, a file address, and the like. If in the process of editing the target document, the preset operation request is obtained by the document marking device, the document marking device parses the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> target document.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">By parsing the target document only when the preset condition is met, it is realized that only a specific document is parsed, such that a processing cost of the document marking device can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, the information on each associated user may include a tenant identifier to which each associated user belongs. The tenant identifier is an encrypted string, which can be generated based on company information entered by each associated user during registration. Different users of the same company correspond to the same tenant identifier. Therefore, when it is determined whether the target document is an external document, i.e., when it is determined whether the attribute of the target document is external, determining the attribute of the target document based on the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document includes: determining the attribute of the target document based on a tenant identifier to which each associated user belongs; or determining the attribute of the target document based on a tenant identifier to which each sub-user included in each associated user belongs. Specifically, when each associated user is an individual user, if in the information on each associated user, the tenant identifier to which at least one associated user belongs is inconsistent with the tenant identifiers of other associated users, it is determined that the attribute of the target document is external. When the associated user is a group, if the tenant identifier to which at least one sub-user in the group belongs is inconsistent with the tenant identifiers to which other sub-users in the group belong, it is determined that the attribute of the target document is external. Therefore, determining the attribute of the target document in accordance with a unique tenant identifier corresponding to each company is beneficial to improving an accuracy of document marking.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, when the target document corresponds to a first associated user and a second associated user belonging to different tenant identifiers, subsequent to determining the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document, the second associated user may be marked in a display interface of the target document for the first associated user. When tenant identifiers to which the first associated user and the second associated user belong are different, it can be determined that the first associated user and the second associated user belong to different<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> companies. For the first associated user, the second associated user is a user from an external company. Thus, the second associated user can be marked in the display interface of the target document for the first associated user. For example, the mark "External" can be added to the upper right corner of a name of the second associated user for marking. Similarly, in a display interface of the target document for the second associated user, the first associated user is marked. Consequently, by marking, when the target document corresponds to the first associated user and the second associated user belonging to different tenant identifiers, the second associated user in the display interface of the target document for the first associated user, a user from an external company involved in the document is marked.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, in a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, subsequent to marking the second associated user in the display interface of the target document for the first associated user, it can also be determined whether the second associated user is in a contact list of the first associated user. For example, the name of the second associated user can be matched with a name of each contact in the contact list of the first associated user. If a contact is matched, it is determined that the second associated user is in the contact list of the first associated user. The second associated user in the contact list of the first associated user is marked. In this way, not only marking of the document but also marking of the contact is realized. When a contact is inserted into a document, it is helpful to determine whether the contact is an external contact based on a mark of the contact, thereby reminding an author of a document to pay attention to wording, and improving information security.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">In addition, if the second associated user does not exist in the contact list of the first associated user, but the second associated user exists in a group in the contact list of the first associated user, the second associated user is marked in the group, and/or the group is marked in the contact list.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">It can be understood that when a user joins a group, a name of the group is displayed in a contact list of the user. Therefore, in a possible implementation of an embodiment of the present disclosure, when a third associated user corresponding to the target document includes a first sub-user and a second sub-user belonging to different tenant identifiers, subsequent to determining the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document, the third associated user may be marked in a contact list of the first sub-user and a contact list of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the second sub-user. For example, assuming that the third associated user is a collaborator group that includes two collaborators Z1 and Z2 from different companies, the collaborator group will be displayed in a contact list of Z1 and a contact list of Z2. Since Z1 and Z2 belong to different companies, that is, Z1 and Z2 belong to different tenant identifiers in the collaborator group, the collaborator group is marked in the contact list corresponding to Z1, and the collaborator group is marked in the contact list corresponding to Z2. For example, the mark "External" can be added to the collaborator group. In this way, a group containing users from different companies is marked. Consequently, when the group is mentioned, the user may distinguish the attribute of the group based on the mark of the group, so as to easily identify the external group by the user.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">It is to be noted that according to the document marking method provided by the present disclosure, not only the target document and each associated user are marked based on the information on each associated user corresponding to the target document, but also each contact in the contact list is marked based on the tenant identifier to which each contact belongs and the tenant identifier to which each associated user belongs in the contact list corresponding to each associated user, and each group in the contact list is marked based on tenant identifiers that belong to each user and each associated user included in each group in the contact list.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Taking the first associated user as an example, for each contact in the contact list corresponding to the first associated user, a tenant identifier to which each contact belongs is obtained. The tenant identifier to which each contact belongs is matched with the tenant identifier to which the first associated user belongs. If a tenant identifier to which a contact belongs is inconsistent with the tenant identifier to which the first associated user belongs, it is determined that the contact is an external contact, and the contact is marked in the contact list. For a group in the contact list, a tenant identifier to which each user in the group belongs is obtained. The tenant identifier to which each user belongs is matched with the tenant identifier to which the first associated user belongs. If a tenant identifier to which at least one user belongs does not match the tenant identifier to which the first associated user belongs, it is determined that the group is an external group, and the group is marked in the contact list of the first associated user. By marking each contact and each group in the contact list, when a collaborator mentions or invites a contact or a group in a document, the collaborator may, on a basis of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> mark, determine whether the mentioned or invited contact is an external collaborator, and determine whether the mentioned or invited group is an external group, thereby achieving a purpose of reminding the collaborator to pay attention to the wording.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">After contacts or groups in the contact list is marked, if the user performs a preset operation to insert a contact, a group or a document when editing the document, it may be determined, based on information displayed in a pop-up window corresponding to the preset operation, whether a contact to be inserted is an external contact, a group to be inserted is an external group, and a document to be inserted is an external document. The preset operation may be, for example, inputting a preset symbol @, or triggering an "Insert" key in the document editing interface. For example, if user B enters content "@ZENG Qing" when editing a document, a pop-up window as illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> will pop up. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the pop-up window displays all types of content related to the contact "ZENG Qing" to be inserted, including similar contacts and documents related to ZENG Qing. For a contact marked "External", it indicates that the contact and user B belong to different companies. For a document marked "External", it indicates that the document is an external document, that is, the document contains an external collaborator. When user B selects a piece of information, for example, the user selects the contact "ZENG Xiaoqing" and clicks on a "Mention" key, "ZENG Xiaoqing" may be inserted into the document, i.e., content "@ZENG Xiaoqing" is displayed in the document. In the pop-up window as illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, content related to the contact "ZENG Qing" to be inserted may also be displayed in category. For example, when user B clicks on "Contacts" on a left side of the pop-up window, only contacts related to "ZENG Qing" are displayed on a right side of the pop-up window, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
