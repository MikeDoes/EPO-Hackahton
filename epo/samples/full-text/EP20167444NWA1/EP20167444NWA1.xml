<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the oral administration of an active in animals. In particular, the present invention relates to a liquid drug-containing formulation comprising at least one drug, which is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor and at least one natural oil of herbal origin. The present invention further relates to the use of a liquid formulation aid composition comprising at least one natural oil of herbal and/or animal origin in a liquid drug-containing formulation for improving the acceptance or voluntary acceptance of drug intake in animal.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Certain diseases require a daily and long term medication in veterinary medicine, which usually need to be administered by untrained owners at home. Said medication is often to be administered orally, which is especially with cats and dogs difficult when the product has an undesired flavor. The animals tend to refuse the drug intake. This can be dangerous for the owners of the animal. Further, a complete drug intake of the needed medication cannot be ensured. These difficulties are even worse, if the medication needs to be administered daily over a prolonged administration period.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">One example for the need of a daily long term administration is the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases associated with hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase enzymes. Such diseases may be cardiovascular diseases, cardiac insufficiency, anemia, chronic kidney diseases, or renal insufficiency, especially anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Most commercially available oral drug-containing formulations are aqueous based solutions or suspensions.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5756474A"><text>US5756474</text></patcit> relates to a non-aqueous oral-drench composition to treat parasitic diseases in mammals. It is disclosed that aqueous formulations generally have a better taste.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20120141546A"><text>US20120141546</text></patcit> relates to an oil-based preparation for controlling parasitic protozoans and endoparasites in animals. The focus is on the single administration.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Hence, there is an ongoing need of a formulation for the oral medication for animals having a high acceptance or voluntary acceptance of the respective medicine to ensure the safety of the individual administering the drug-containing formulation and the compliance. In this connection, it has been an object of the present invention to provide a drug-containing formulation with a high acceptance or voluntary acceptance. Further, it has been an object of the present invention to provide a convenient drug administration for animals. In particular, it has been an object of the present invention to provide an improved intake of a drug-containing formulation comprising at least one hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor. Further, it has been an object of the present invention to provide a liquid formulation aid composition to improve the drug intake in animal.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
