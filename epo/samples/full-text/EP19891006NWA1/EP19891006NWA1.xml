<p id="pa01" num="0001">The present invention addresses the problem of providing a novel method for treating cancer, particularly cancer that has been difficult to be treated by already-existing therapies. The present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies. As a result, it is found that a therapeutic method in which a combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a FOLFIRINOX therapy, a modified FOLFIRINOX therapy or a low-dose regimen of each of the therapies is applied can become an effective cancer therapeutic method. Particularly, according to the present invention, it is expected to provide a novel therapeutic method for pancreatic cancer that is one of refractory cancer types and has been difficult to be treated by already-existing therapies.<img id="iaf01" file="imgaf001.tif" wi="82" he="59" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></p>

<heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">FOLFIRINOX therapy (hereinafter, may be abbreviated as "FFX therapy") is one of standard treatments which have been being performed for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, it is known that adverse events such as bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting frequently occur and the like occur with high frequency, and in order to reduce them, modified FOLFIRINOX therapy (hereinafter, abbreviated as "mFFX therapy") of which the dose is reduced also has been being provided.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Unlike conventional therapies such as chemotherapy, cancer immunotherapy which suppresses or treats the progression of cancer by strengthening the immune system against cancer through acting on the immune surveillance which is inherent in a patient with cancer has been attracting attention in recent years. In particular, inhibitors against immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1 (Programmed Cell Death-1) or its ligand PD-L1 (Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1), so-called immune checkpoint inhibitors (hereinafter, may be abbreviated as "immune CP inhibitor") have achieved certain results in clinical practice.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As a combination of these therapies in cancer treatment, preoperative therapy in which FFX therapy, anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab and radiation therapy were combined has been clinically tested in patients with pancreatic cancer without metastasis (Non-patent literature 1).</p>
