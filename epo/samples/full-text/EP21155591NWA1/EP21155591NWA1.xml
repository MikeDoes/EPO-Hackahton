<abstract id="abst" lang="en">
<p id="pa01" num="0001">A method of reducing the Packet Internet Grope (PING) latency, e.g., in 5G New Radio (NR) or LTE system, is provided. When first two PING requests are received from a user equipment (UE) in uplink (UL), the UE will use Scheduling Request (SR) and Buffer Status Report (BSR) cycle to obtain UL grants for the first two PING requests. Starting from the third PING request, the size of the proactive allocation window for giving UL allocation to the PING request is uniquely configured, using a "delay timer" and a "proactive allocation window." The delay timer is to delay the start of the proactive allocation window from the transmission time interval (TTI) in which the packet type is detected. The proactive allocation window is the number of TTIs over which the proactive allocations are given to a UE.

<heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</b></heading>
<heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for improving network latency for Radio Access Networks (RANs), and relates more particularly for 4<sup>th</sup>-Generation (4G) and 5<sup>th</sup>-Generation (5G) based mobile networks.</p>
<heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Network communication latency characteristics, which are measured using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) application latency and Packet Internet Grope (PING) application latency, are key performance indicators (KPIs) for network operators. Therefore, reducing these latencies is important to improving the network operation. In one example step, the PING application latency can be optimized, and the transmission control protocol acknowledgment (TCP ACK) latency can be optimized in another example step, and the TCP ACK latency optimization will in turn increase the download speed, thereby providing a complete solution to the latency issue in the network. The present disclosure is focused on optimizing the PING latency issue.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The PING latency issue is due to two factors: i) one factor is the user equipment (UE) time to access the network in uplink (UL) (by sending Scheduling Request (SR), uplink (UL) grant for Buffer Status Report + Power Headroom Report (BSR+PHR), followed by UL grant for transmission of UL Data); and ii) the second factor is due to the stale PHR (as there are no proactive allocations for inactive UEs for PHR transmissions). <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the delay introduced in the UE side (shown as 1001) to access the network (shown as 1002).</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Regarding the two factors described above, when there is no UL data transmission happening from a UE, the UE doesn't have a UL grant to request for more UL grants (e.g., to send a Packet Internet Grope (PING) Request) by sending a Buffer Status Report<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (BSR). Instead, the UE has to send a Scheduling Request (SR) in the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) to get the UL grant to send the BSR, and this process introduces a delay in the UE side to access the network (to access the network as soon as possible once the PING Request is ready in the UE media access control (MAC) layer to be transmitted in the Air). In addition, the UL grant given by evolved node B (eNB) in response to SR is given without any recent PHR report (as there is no UL data transmissions in the air (i.e., over a wireless interface) during UL inactivity, typically the PHR reports are piggybacked along with UL data transmissions by a UE when the UL data transmissions occur), so the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and transmit power command (TPC) for the UL grant needs to be conservative, as there is no exact information available from the UE to decide on this.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Known attempts to improve the PING latency issue are complex and not robust. For example, one known approach involves the following: i) determines whether the UE is carrying out PING according to a learning result; ii) determines a period of sending a data packet by the UE when determining that the UE is carrying out PING and carries out pre-scheduling according to the period; and iii) whether to carry out pre-scheduling in a later learning period is determined according to a learning result of a previous learning period. This approach, which is learning-window-based, is complex and requires multiple PINGs to learn and adapt. Therefore, there is a need for an improved technique for solving the PING latency issue.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b></heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The present disclosure focuses on a method to reduce the network latency as measured using the PING application, thereby providing improved quality of experience (QoE) for network users.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In an example method according to the present disclosure, in order to reduce the PING latency, e.g., in 5G New Radio (NR) or LTE system, the example method is triggered only for user equipments (UEs) with uplink (UL) inactivity, i.e., Evolved Node B (eNodeB or eNB) missed at-least two or more Power Headroom Report (PHR) cycles (periods) from a UE. The example method reduces the PING latency by more than 11ms<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> when compared to existing 3GPP-standard-based UE network access schemes, with SR periodicity of 20ms. In the case of High Capacity cells, the SR periodicity will be increased to support more capacity, e.g., the SR periodicity will go to 80ms, which will increase the PING latency significantly, so the example method according to the present disclosure significantly reduces the PING latency in these scenarios.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, when the first and second PING Requests are received from the UE in UL, UE will use the SR and BSR cycles to get the UL Grant, and starting from the third PING request, a proactive allocation window size of 2<sup>âˆ—</sup>SR periodicity/3, e.g., 2<sup>âˆ—</sup>20/3, will be provided, so there will be 11 proactive allocations spread across 33 of the transmission time intervals (TTIs), which is a unique way of sending proactive allocations.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, the time estimation to find the PING request packet arrival is based on the time of receipt of the Scheduling Request (SR). In addition, in an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, the typical "proactive allocation window" (the number of the transmission time intervals (TTIs) over which the proactive allocations are given to UE) is set to 4, and subsequently the "proactive allocation window" may be adapted based on learning.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, the latency reduction is achieved starting from the third PING request packet onwards.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">In an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, for UL synchronized HARQ in LTE based systems, "HARQ Feedback" is addressed in the proactive allocation. In addition, error cases are addressed, e.g., when the data in proactive allocation is received with error. The above scenarios are similarly handled for 5G New Radio (NR) based systems also, for asynchronous UL HARQ.</p>

<heading id="h0007"><u>UE-INITIATED PING LATENCY REDUCTION</u></heading>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to reduce the Packet Internet Grope (PING) latency, e.g., in 5G New Radio (NR) or LTE system, the following scheme is triggered only for user equipments (UEs) with uplink (UL) inactivity, i.e., eNodeB missed at-least two or more Power Headroom Report (PHR) cycles (periods) from a UE.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">There are two components to this example embodiment of the method, "delay timer" and "proactive allocation window." The delay timer is to delay the start of the proactive allocation window from the transmission time interval (TTI) in which the packet type is detected, i.e., detected using IP header "Protocol" number field. The proactive allocation window is the number of TTIs over which the proactive allocations are given to a UE. For example, if there are 4 allocations continuously spread over 4 TTIs, then the proactive allocation window size is 4 TTIs. This proactive allocation window size and start time are tuned in each step (e.g., for each PING request received).</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a process diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the PING latency reduction method according to the present disclosure. When the PING request arrives (process arrow 201) from the UE 1001 to the distributed unit's (eNB-DU 1002, also referred to as simply DU 1002) media access control (MAC) layer, the DU 1002 checks whether the UE 1001 has been inactive, and if so, the DU 1002 will i) store the Received System Frame Number (Received_SFN)/subframe number (Subframe_Num), which Received_SFN/Subframe_Num corresponds to the TTI in which the SR was received, and ii) indicate (process arrow 202) to the central unit's (eNB-CU 1003, also referred to as simply CU 1003) Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) to "detect the packet type" and "size" information, i.e., send the information (Info = {Packet type, and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> size}). In the CU PDCP layer, after decryption, the type of the packet (e.g., PING request) is detected (box 203), by checking the IP header, and the size of the packet is found by checking the internet control message protocol (ICMP) payload. This information will be provided (process arrow 204) to DU 1002's MAC layer, along with Received_SFN/Subframe_Num, and the DU 1002's MAC Layer will note the TTI in which it received the CU 1003's transmitted information with Current_SFN/Subframe_Num.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In an example embodiment according to the present disclosure, the first and second PING requests (P1 and P2, respectively) from the UE 1001 will use SR, BSR and UL Grant sequence flow. The example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure reduces the latency from the third PING request (P3) onwards. The TTIs in which the SR was received for the first and second PING requests (P1 and P2, respectively) will be noted in DU 1002, e.g., as Received_SFN#P1/Subframe_Num#P1 and Received_SFN#P2/Subframe_Num#P2.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In the case of a second PING request (P2) from the UE 1001, the proactive allocation window delay timer value is defined as follows: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Delay Timer#</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="68" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>Received_SFN#P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>Subframe_Num#P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo><mi>Received_SFN#P</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>Subframe_Num#P</mi><mn>1</mn></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="82" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0003" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi>Current_SFN#P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>Subframe_Num#P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo><mi>Received_SFN#P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>Subframe_Num#P</mi><mn>2</mn></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="79" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn>3</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>*</mo><mfenced><mi>UEAppToMACLayerDelay</mi></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="66" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0005" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">4</mn><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>*</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">SR periodicity</mi></mfenced><mo>âˆ’</mo><mfenced separators=""><mfenced separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>*</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">SR periodicity</mi></mfenced><mo>*</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">20</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></mfenced><mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math><img id="ib0005" file="imgb0005.tif" wi="99" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">For the sake of clarity, the parameter "(Received_SFN#P2/Subframe_Num#P2 - Received_SFN#P1/Subframe_Num#P1)" will be referenced as "APPROX PING INTERVAL." The UEAppToMACLayerDelay, which represents the delay from the PING application (App) to the MAC Layer in the UE, can be, e.g., 2ms, but this value can be tuned after testing.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The above-defined delay timer, DELAY TIMER#1, (note that box 205 in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> can represent DELAY TIMER#1 through DELAY TIMER#n) will be started in DU 1002's MAC layer, after packet detection information is received from CU 1003's PDCP layer. This delay timer (DELAY TIMER#1) value represents an estimation to find the next PING interval in which the next PING request will occur, i.e., trying to estimate the time delays the first and second PING requests experienced in the UE and in the air (wireless) interface. In an example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure, 20% of the time from the SR periodicity is deducted based on the assumption that PING requests #1 (P1) and #2 (P2) suffer 20% delay to access the SR occasion. For example, if the SR periodicity is 2<sup>âˆ—</sup>20ms - 8ms = 40ms - 8ms = 32ms, we assume the UE experienced 4ms (8ms/2) delay to access the SR occasion.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The Received_SFN#P2 is the SFN/SF in which the SR for a second PING request (P2) is received from the UE 1001 in MAC layer and at the same time in the CU 1003's packet detection, if the packet is confirmed as a PING request. When the delay timer (DELAY TIMER#1, represented by box 205 in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) ends, the corresponding proactive allocation window will be started (as shown by box 206 in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>), which proactive allocation window can include, e.g., 11 UL allocations (in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, UL allocations are shown as UL Grants #1, 2, 3, 4 and n, so n=11 for the example case of 11 UL allocations for UL grants after DELAY TIMER#1). The 11 UL allocations correspond to SR periodicity/proactive allocation gap, e.g., 32ms/3 = 11 UL allocations, each with three TTIs gap (or width), so the proactive allocation window will cover 33 TTIs (representing the window size) when the second PING request (P2) is received, and which proactive allocation window provides UL allocation to a third PING request (P3). The proactive allocation gap (3 in the above example) is referenced as PROACT_ALLOC_GAP_Win#1.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Each allocation will be of a size corresponding to a PING request payload. Once the PING request is received in one of the proactive allocations (among the 11 allocations, for example), the proactive allocation window will be stopped. The first proactive allocation window size in the example is of 11 UL grants (corresponding to a total of 33 TTIs). The reason for this is, if the SR periodicity is assumed to be, e.g., 20ms,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the occasion in which the UE sends an SR will be random within the period, i.e., at any moment starting from 0ms to 20ms. Therefore, it can't be assumed that 20ms will be the time at which the SR is received, i.e., such an assumption will not reduce the PING latency to full extent.</p>

<p id="p0044" num="0044">Example Case#1: All the proactive allocations in the allocation window will have DCIO with RV0, so that eNB will not do the HARQ soft combining by mistake, e.g., when UE retransmits padded data due to wrong HARQ feedback decoding. In addition, eNB will not send NACK for the padded data sent by UE (with error) in the proactive allocation window.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">Example Case#2: For the second and third proactive allocation windows in a PING burst, in the case of 4 allocations provided in each of these proactive allocation windows, if the padding data transmitted by UE in any one allocation is in CRC error, and the eNB has already received the intended PING request before the actual subframe in which the synchronous retransmission happens, then the eNB will not send NACK. For example, if the padding data in the first allocation (Alloc#1) in the allocation window is in CRC error, and i) the padding data continue to be received in the second and third allocations (Alloc#2 and Alloc#3) in the allocation window without BSR, and ii) in the fourth allocation (Alloc#4) the expected user data is received, then the eNB will send ACK as HARQ feedback. This is possible because the feedback for the Alloc#1 will be sent in the 8th subframe, by which time it is possible to decode the Alloc#4 and determine whether the expected user data is received or not.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Example Case#3: In the case of 4 allocations provided in the proactive allocation window, if the UE i) sends the padded data in the Alloc#1, ii) sends in Alloc#2 the actual data which is in CRC error, and iii) sends Alloc#3 and Alloc#4 with padded data, then the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> eNB will not be able to know whether the PUSCH received in Alloc#2 is padded data or the actual data. In this case, the window size will not be extended, thereby allowing the UE to recover from the error, send an SR and transmit a PING request. This applies for all cases where one PUSCH (allocation) is in error out of four UL grants, and the remaining three are received successfully with padded data.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Example Case#4: This case is substantially similar to the Example Case#2, with the only differences being that the UE not able to catch up with the window size (4 allocations), and the last allocation is also padding data without BSR. This scenario is possible because, for Alloc#1 and Alloc#4, feedback will be sent in the 8th and 12th subframes, respectively, by which time it is possible to decode Alloc#4 and determine whether the expected user data is received or not, and send ACK as HARQ feedback for the padded data.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Example Case#5: In the case of 4 allocations provided in the proactive allocation window, if the data in all 4 allocations are in error, eNB will not be able to determine whether expected user data in one of the proactive allocations is in error.

<heading id="h0012"><u>5G NR vs. LTE</u></heading>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure is fully applicable to, e.g., 5G NR and LTE, as well as other standards. In the context of the method according to the present disclosure, there are two relevant techniques which are different in 5G NR compared to LTE: one is SR, and the other one is HARQ. The below-described changes to SR and HARQ refer to the changes needed for the 5G NR operation.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">With respect to Scheduling Request (SR) in 5G NR, due to the multiple numerology/TTI type and the associated logical channel, changes in SR is required. The<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> MAC entity can be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">With respect to Code Block Group (CBG)-based HARQ feedback and re-transmissions, it should be noted that there can be a performance degradation of HARQ due to large TB size, and CBG-based feedback and re-transmissions are introduced to overcome the performance degradation. In the channel coding phase in the physical layer, code block segmentation and code block concatenation can be implemented in an example embodiment. The mobile terminal will send HARQ feedback for each of the individual groups of CBGs, and this granular level of feedback mechanism avoids the overhead of re-transmitting the large TB multiple times, which improves the spectral efficiency. In this manner, multiple-bits HARQ feedback is introduced to provide a feedback to multiple CBGs. Even the re-transmissions are of code block granularity. This CBG-based re-transmission and feedback feature is configurable and adaptive, i.e., for a small TB size the method according to the present disclosure can revert to the regular scheme.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">With respect to UL HARQ, it should be noted that asynchronous and adaptive UL HARQ is supported in 5G NR, i.e., it functions with the multiple HARQ processes in any order, and there is no stipulated relationship between a specific HARQ process number a specific subframe. To keep track of each HARQ process even when multiple HARQ processes are not running in order, the sender and the receiver in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. For this, DCI carries a field called HARQ Processor number. In 5G NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI and Uplink Scheduling DCI carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use asynchronous HARQ.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In addition, there is no explicit HARQ ACK/NACK for PUSCH, and basically there is no PHICH channel. If gNB does not send a retransmission request for a certain period of time, UE assumes that PUSCH is successfully received and decoded by gNB.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> In this manner, UE figures out the PUSCH status based on whether it gets a retransmission request from gNB or not.</p>
<heading id="h0013"><u>APPLICABILITY TO 5G NR</u></heading>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">As mentioned above, the example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure is fully applicable to, e.g., 5G NR albeit with some modifications. In this section, each one of the modifications specific to 5G NR application as described above will be further explained in terms of how much (if any) impact the modifications will have on the example embodiment of the method. First, the SR-related changes in 5G NR will not impact the example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure. The UE needs to send the SR to access the network in UL, and this introduces the delay as previously discussed above. Second, the CBG-based feedback and re-transmission will have an impact on the example method according to the present disclosure. Once the packet is received with an error, the CBG-based feedback and re-transmission will be utilized. In this implementation, if the PUSCH received in the proactive allocation window is received with an error, then the eNB will react in a different way, and the corresponding gNB functionality will be defined as described below. Third, asynchronous UL HARQ and no feedback for PUSCH will have an impact on the example method according to the present disclosure, and the relevant changes are described below.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">In UL, asynchronous HARQ is used in 5G NR, and described below are various scenarios in which the 5G NR system handles asynchronous HARQ.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Example Case#1: All the proactive allocations in the window will have DCI 0_0/0_1 with RV0, so that gNB will not do the HARQ soft combining by mistake. In addition, gNB will not send DCI0_0/0_1 with retransmission for the padded data sent by UE with error in the proactive allocation window.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Example Case#2: In the case of a proactive allocation window with 4 allocations, if the padding data transmitted by UE in any one of these allocations is in CRC error, and the gNB has already received the intended PING Request before the actual subframe in<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> which the intended retransmission is supposed to be triggered by the gNB, then the gNB will not trigger the retransmission for that PUSCH. As an example, if i) the padding data in the first allocation (Alloc#1) in the allocation window is in CRC error, ii) the padding data in the second and third allocations (Alloc#2 and Alloc#3) in the allocation window are received without BSR, and iii) in the fourth allocation (Alloc#4) in the allocation window the expected user data is received, then the gNB will not retransmit the Alloc#1. This is possible because, for the Alloc#1, the timing of sending the trigger for retransmission depends on K2 parameter indicated in DCI, e.g., it can be the 8th subframe, by which time we can decode the Alloc#4 and determine whether the data is expected user data or not.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Example Case#3: In the case of a proactive allocation window with 4 allocations, if i) the UE sends the padded data in the first allocation (Alloc#1) within the allocation window, ii) in the second allocation (Alloc#2) within the allocation window the actual data is sent which is in CRC error, and iii) the third and fourth allocations (Alloc#3 and Alloc#4) within the allocation window are sent with padded data, the gNB will not be able to determine whether the PUSCH received in Alloc#2 is padded data or the actual data. In this case, the window size will not be extended, thereby allowing the UE to recover from the error and send an SR and transmit a PING Request. This applies for all cases in which one PUSCH (Allocation) is in error out of four UL grants (allocations), and the remaining three UL grants (allocations) are received successfully with padded data.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Example Case#4: This case is substantially similar to the Example Case#2, with the only differences being that the UE not able to catch up with the window size (4 allocations), and the last allocation is also padding data without BSR. This scenario is possible because, for Alloc#1 and Alloc#4, the timing of the sending of the retransmission trigger depends on K2 parameter indicated in DCI, e.g., it can be the 8th and 12th subframes, respectively, by which time Alloc#4 can be decoded and determined whether the expected user data is received or not, and declare the padded data is successfully received.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Example Case#5: In the case of 4 allocations provided in the proactive allocation window, if the data in all 4 allocations are in error, gNB will not be able to determine whether expected user data in one of the proactive allocations is in error. In this case, the window size will not be extended, thereby allowing the UE to recover from the error, send an SR, declare all four PUSCHs are successful, and there will be no triggering of the retransmit DCI.</p>
<heading id="h0014"><u>OUTTER LOOP RATE CONTROL (OLRC) OPTIMIZATION</u></heading>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">In an example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure, when a padding data is received in the proactive allocation, the ACK response is not updated in the OLRC Step Up calculation. This is necessary because even for padding data with an error, the example embodiment of the method provides an ACK response instead of a NACK response, to reset the HARQ Process status to new. This is valid for the cases in which the data in all 4 proactive allocations are in error.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">In another example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure, if the intended data packet is received in the proactive allocation, HARQ process status and OLRC are active, and the ACK/NACK response will be updated in the OLRC Step Up and Step Down calculation. This is not valid for the cases in which the data in all 4 proactive allocations are in error.</p>
<heading id="h0015"><u>UL DATA DURING ACTIVE DELAY TIMER/PROACTIVE ALLOCATION</u></heading>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">If UL data (any data traffic) arrives in the UE MAC layer when the delay timer is running, UE sends the SR/BSR flow to get the UL allocation to transmit the data. The delay timer will run its course and end. In the case the UE sends the BSR instead of a PING request in the proactive allocation, the proactive allocation window will be stopped. If i) UL data (any data traffic) arrives when the proactive allocation window is running, and ii) the UE sends the BSR instead of a PING request in the proactive allocation, the proactive allocation window will be stopped.</p>
<heading id="h0016"><u>PING &amp; UL TRAFFIC</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> -->
<p id="p0065" num="0065">This section describes what happens when the PING is started when UL traffic is going on, and continues even after the UL traffic has stopped. In the case of PING request transmission during UL traffic flow (PING or any other traffic), UE will send BSR in the UL grant given to the UL traffic flow and get the UL grant for the PING request transmission. In the case of a PING request transmission when the UL traffic flow has stopped, for two PHR cycles there will not be any proactive allocation, and the UE will be using SR/BSR flow to get the UL grant. Thereafter, the UE will be identified as UL-inactive UE (when two or more PHR cycles are missed), and the PING latency reduction scheme embodied in the example method according to the present disclosure will be implemented.</p>
<heading id="h0017"><u>APPLICATION TO HIGH CAPACITY CELLS AND BUSY HOURS</u></heading>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">This section describes how an example embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure is applied to high capacity cells (e.g., 1,000 Radio Resource Control (RRC) Connected UEs) and during busy/non-busy hours for the cells. In the case of the cell PRB utilization being high (or during busy hours), the proactive allocation for the UE need not be supported to reduce the PING latency, but instead alert the UE that the cell is highly loaded (and let the PING latency increase). In the case of the cell PRB utilization being low (or during non-busy hours), the proactive allocation for the UE can be supported to reduce the PING latency.</p>
