<p id="p0001" num="0001">The presently disclosed subject matter relates to a computerized content aggregation system, and more particularly, to a computerized gaming content aggregation system and methods of operating thereof.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In the industry of computerized games, a content aggregation system or platform, is a software or hardware system that provides a standardised protocol or application programming interface (API) that integrates various entities of the network, and assists them to communicate with each other through the content aggregation platform. Different remote game servers (RGSs) can be integrated into content aggregation system platforms. In turn, the content aggregation platform is usually integrated into multiple player management systems and gaming platforms that connect between client terminals to gaming creators and operators, and wallet management systems that support the gaming.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Content aggregation of this nature introduces a number of complexities at the aggregation platform level, for example, when multiple instances of the aggregation platform exist, and each has multiple instances of the same RGS connected to it potentially, in more than one geographic area. Moreover, the same content can be available from multiple instances of the same RGS across the multiple aggregation platform instances. Identifying the exact location of a particular content within a particular RGS that is connected to a particular instance of the aggregation platform currently involves many challenges. The problems compound even further when a single gaming operator or a casino is served by multiple different aggregation platforms that deliver the content to it.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, a simplified integration of content is desired.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">As apparent from the following discussions, and unless specifically stated otherwise, it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as "communicating", "storing", "associating", "using", "generating", "providing", "discovering" or the like, refer to the action(s) and/or process(es) of a computer that manipulate and/or transform data into other data, said data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities and/or said data representing the physical objects. The term "computer" should be expansively construed to cover any kind of hardware-based electronic device with data processing capabilities<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> including, by way of non-limiting example, the gaming system disclosed in the present application.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The operations in accordance with the teachings herein may be performed by a computer specially constructed for the desired purposes, or by a general-purpose computer specially configured for the desired purpose by a computer program stored in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Gaming environments involve a large number of separate entities operating and communicating through a complex network and architecture. Content, such as games, are created by a content creator or content provider and are stored on Remote Gaming Servers (RGSs) around the world. A game can be stored on more than one RGS. A licensee of a casino, also to be referred to herein as an operator, can choose to operate one or more games by adding them to the operator's portfolio, while the games themselves are stored on a single RGS or multiple RGSs. Operation of the games is subject to various dynamic parameters and configurations, some of which are dictated by local legislation and some being determined or structured by the content creator, the licensee operator, or the RGS itself. In addition, the games can communicate with external systems, such as backend and management systems of the licensee operators, player management systems, various analytic systems, and wallet management systems. As such, there is a constant communication of data to and from the content stored on a particular RGS, e.g. the game, to other entities operating in the network.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">A content aggregation system or platform provides a standardised protocol or API that integrates various entities of the network, and assists them to communicate with each other through the content aggregation platform. In order to simplify the effort needed to integrate different content providers to operators, an Aggregator Aggregation Platform (AAP) is created. The AAP aggregates numerous content aggregation systems (or platforms) in a hierarchal manner and implements a discovery process, after which the APP generates a logical geographic coordinate system of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> content stored in the network. The logical geographic coordinate system assists the AAP to accurately identify a particular content stored on a particular RGS that communicates with the AAP through one of the aggregation platforms.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Bearing this in mind, attention is drawn to <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> which shows a high level illustration of a gaming environment 100 in accordance with certain embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a specific example of a gaming environment with two aggregation platforms <b>102,</b> each located in a different geographic location. One of the platforms is located in Europe, and the other is located in the East. An aggregation platform <b>102</b> is configured to implement a unified point of integration for several entities of the network, and provides an abstraction layer(s) between the various entities. As illustrated, aggregation platform <b>102</b> aggregates several different content providers (to be referred to hereinbelow also as Remote Game Servers (RGSs)), operators of the content, gaming system (GPAS) providing gaming functionalities, and wallet systems.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Each platform <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> implements a unified interface and aggregates several entities in the complex and dynamic network illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. <b>1</b></figref> by operatively communicating with the entities. However, the two platforms <b>102</b> in Europe and in the East, do not communicate with each other. As such, content provider #3 that communicates with aggregation platform <b>102</b> East, and wishes to communicate with aggregation platform <b>102</b> and offer the games created by it to the operators of aggregation platform <b>102</b> Europe, cannot do so without a specific connection to the aggregation platform <b>102</b> Europe. The reverse applies to content provider #<b>2</b>. Hence, it may be advantageous to integrate, in a higher level, at an aggregator aggregation platform (AAP) layer, the services provided by each aggregation platform <b>102,</b> in order that entities operating in the network may obtain easier access to all available services.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>

<p id="p0022" num="0022">Each RGS <b>103</b> is a content provider. The RGS <b>103</b> is a software platform that can be deployed as single or multiple instances and can host one or more types of content <b>104.</b> In some examples, content <b>104</b> is a game. RGSs <b>103</b> provides functioning games and gaming services such as clients, game logic, and random number generation to operators <b>107,</b> that choose to operate the games. Operators <b>107</b> include, for example, casinos licensees. RGSs <b>103</b> can provide its gaming services to operators <b>107</b> via aggregation platform <b>102.</b></p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">GPAS (Gaming Platform as a Service) <b>105</b> is configured to communicate with aggregation platform <b>102,</b> as an RGS, and operatively communicates with one or more client terminals (referred to hereinafter as "client") and is configured to run one or more game clients. GPAS can be configured to enable all necessary game management functions (e.g. executing and resolving game logic, game flows, error flows, regulation requirements, etc.) and further operatively communicates, directly, or via platform <b>102,</b> to operator <b>107</b> or wallet systems <b>106.</b> Other functionalities and gaming services of GPAS <b>105</b> are available through aggregation platform <b>102.</b><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The entities in the network, including aggregation platform <b>102,</b> RGSs <b>103</b> and GPAS <b>105</b> can be implemented on one or more server computers, and comprise a processor and memory circuitry (PMC) (not shown). Each PMC of an entity comprises a processor and a memory, and is configured to execute several functional modules in accordance with computer-readable instructions implemented on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium. Such functional modules are referred to hereinafter as comprised in the PMC.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, a person versed in the art would appreciate that in some examples, one or more of the entities in the network can constitute a complex entity, comprised of several entities having a similar functionality, in a consolidated manner. For example, a aggregation platform <b>102</b> can be integrated into another aggregation platform <b>102,</b> both constituting the functionality of the aggregation platform <b>102</b> as described throughout the description. Similarly, each RGS <b>103</b> can be integrated into another RGS <b>103,</b> or operate in a collaborative manner. Also, any content referred to as stored in an RGS, can be stored in a remote storage, or in another entity, such as in the aggregation platform <b>102</b> or the AAP <b>103.</b> In such cases, any reference to an identifier of an entity can be referred to as a complex identifier, composed of identifiers of all entities integrated in the complex entity, e.g. composed in a concatenated manner or the like.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">As mentioned, it may be advantageous to integrate, in a higher level, the services provided by each aggregation platform <b>102.</b> Bearing this in mind, reference is made to <figref idref="f0003">Fig. <b>3</b></figref><b>,</b> showing a high-level functional block diagram of an integrated gaming environment <b>300,</b> in accordance with certain embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idref="f0003">Fig. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an aggregator aggregation platform (AAP) <b>301</b> that is configured to aggregate the two aggregation platforms <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="f0002">Fig. <b>2</b></figref><b>.</b> The AAP <b>301</b> operatively communicates with aggregation platform <b>102-1</b> and aggregation<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> platform <b>102-2</b> and is configured to obtain data from the platforms <b>102</b> and to integrate the data that is received from each platform.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Aggregating the data on each stored content <b>104</b> at the AAP <b>301</b> level has several technological advantages. Operators <b>107-1</b> communicating with the platform <b>102-1</b> obtain services from RGS <b>103-1.1</b> and/or RGS <b>103-1.2</b> only. Aggregating the data on the AAP <b>301</b> level enables RGS <b>103-2.1</b> and <b>103-2.2</b> that communicate with platform <b>102-2</b> to provide services and communicate also with operators <b>107-1,</b> and not only operators <b>107-2.</b> Operators <b>107-1</b> can communicate directly with the AAP <b>301</b> in a single user interface, and be exposed to services provided by all RGSs <b>103</b> from the various platforms <b>102,</b> including <b>RGS 103-2.1</b> and <b>103-2.2.</b> Communicating data from external systems <b>108</b> that pertains to a particular piece of content <b>104</b> through the AAP <b>301,</b> is also achieved in a simpler manner.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">However, the integration itself involves several challenges with respect to locating and accurately identifying a particular piece of content <b>104</b> stored on a particular RGS <b>103,</b> and communicating data that pertains to the particular piece of content <b>104,</b> to the correct RGS that stores the piece of content <b>104.</b> For example, if the game is operated both by an RGS <b>103-2.1</b> and by an RGS <b>103-1.1,</b> any game identifier that is used to identify the game on the RGSs <b>103</b> is expected to be the same across both instances of the RGSs <b>103.</b> This challenge is further enhanced when there are several instances of the platforms <b>102,</b> each having multiple instances of the same RGS 103 connected to it, in potentially multiple geographic areas, each of which store the same type of game. Assuming that operator <b>107</b> wishes to configure a game by updating the game characteristics, such as updating the maximal betting amount, communicating data from the operator <b>107</b> to the correct RGS <b>103</b> that stores that game, may encounter difficulties.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In order to identify the location of each of stored piece of content <b>104,</b> AAP <b>301</b> aggregates numerous content aggregation systems (or platforms) in a hierarchal manner, and implements a discovery process, after which the AAP <b>301</b> generates a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> logical geographic coordinate system of the network. The logical geographic coordinate system includes generating a unique path identifier for each stored piece of content <b>104.</b> The unique path identifier assists the AAP <b>301</b> to accurately identify the logical geographic location of each of the stored at least one piece of content in the network, in order to facilitate communicating data that pertains to a specific piece of content <b>104.</b> The meaning of logical geographic location of a piece of content is further described below in relation to <figref idref="f0005">Figs. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="f0006"><b>6</b></figref><b>.</b></p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Generating a unique path identifier for each piece of content enables casino licensees (operator <b>107)</b> to communicate with AAP <b>301,</b> and configure a game that is operated by separate RGSs <b>103</b> and platforms <b>102,</b> in a single process, through the AAP <b>301.</b> Moreover, displaying various games <b>104</b> operated by various RGSs <b>103,</b> after discovering them by the AAP <b>301,</b> enables operators <b>107</b> to add them to the casino portfolio operated by them.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In some examples, using the unique path identifier to identify a logical geographic location of a stored piece of content <b>104</b> assists additional systems to communicate data that pertains to the piece of content <b>104,</b> through the AAP <b>301,</b> in a more simplified manner. Such systems include, for example, external systems <b>108,</b> wallet systems <b>106</b> and GPAS <b>105.</b></p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">For example, AAP <b>301</b> can run a discovery process and compare the results of content <b>104</b> that was returned, to the results of a previous discovery process. Any changes can be conveyed to relevant operators. For example, if a particular game <b>104</b> that was available on a particular RGS <b>103</b> as discovered in a discovery process, was not returned in the results of a later discovery process, then any operators <b>107</b> that added that game <b>104</b> to its portfolio, can be notified that the game <b>104</b> is no longer available. Another example includes updating operators <b>107</b> with respect to any changes to characteristics of game <b>104,</b> e.g. whether a game moved from a staging mode to a production mode, or a list of the games that are currently operating in each mode. Other characteristics relating to content <b>104,</b> that were updated, such as if a certain game has<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> updated the languages/ currencies or any other information or parameter, then such information can be conveyed back to the operators. The entities of environment <b>300</b> marked by a dashed line (block <b>302</b> in <figref idref="f0003"><b>Fig. 3</b></figref><b>)</b> are described in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. <b>4</b></figref><b>,</b> in a hierarchical manner, in a content aggregation network <b>400.</b></p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idref="f0004">Fig. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a generalized block diagram of a gaming hierarchy configured in accordance with certain embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. In some examples, the lowest level includes RGSs <b>103.</b> Since there are multiple types of RGSs available, such as RGS configured for casino games, GPAS (Gaming Platform as a Service) and such, an identifier that describes the type of the RGS is associated with each RGS <b>103,</b> denoted as rgsType. For example, RGS <b>103</b> denoted by rgsType: provider_<b>1</b> indicates that the RGS <b>103</b> is operated by provider_<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Since more than one RGS <b>103</b> (or instances of a specific RGS type) can be integrated into aggregation platform <b>102,</b> each instance of RGS <b>103</b> is identified by an instance identifier. The instance identifier is local to the instance of the aggregation platform <b>102</b> and is denoted as rgslD. The rgsID can be a simple or complex identifier. In order for an RGS to be uniquely identified by the platform <b>102,</b> each RGS <b>103</b> is associated with an RGS identifier. The RGS identifier can include the RGS type and/or the RGS instance. The RGS identifier is indicative of at least a geographic location of the associated RGS. In some examples, the geographic location includes an indication of the territory or area on which the RGS <b>103</b> is located. Upon receipt of the RGS identifier by platform <b>102,</b> platform <b>102</b> can obtain data on the geographic location of the RGS <b>103.</b></p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In some examples, each RGS <b>103</b> is configured for storing at least one piece of content <b>104,</b> e.g. a game. The game is hosted and made available through a specific RGS <b>103.</b> RGS <b>103</b> is configured to associate a content identifier for each of the stored content <b>104.</b> The content identifier is an immutable identifier, denoted in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. <b>4</b></figref> by gamelD. For example, RGS <b>103</b> of rgsType: provider_<b>1</b> stores two games <b>104</b> identified by content identifiers gamelD: <b>1</b> and gamelD: <b>2.</b> In some examples, each content <b>104</b> is<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> associated with characteristics. For example, for a content <b>104</b> constituting a game, the characteristics of the content can include operational parameters of the game or configuration characteristics of the game. Operational parameters of the game includes for example, versioning information of the game, game paytable (RTF (return to player) information, software package version, list of currencies the game is playable in, list of languages the game supports, etc. Configuration characteristics of the game can include configuration parameters that are often unique to the game itself. Examples of configuration parameters of a slot machine may include (but are not limited to): Maximum Bet, Minimum Bet, Available bet sizes/coin sizes, Free bet sizes/coin sizes, and feature enabling flags. Configuration parameters of a table game such as Blackjack may include (but not be limited to): Number of decks, Number of cards per deck, Insurance allowed and Double Down Bet allowed. In some examples, the content identifier is indicative of characteristics of the content.

<p id="p0038" num="0038">The network <b>400</b> can include more than one instance of an aggregation platform <b>102.</b> Two instances of aggregation platform <b>102</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. <b>4</b></figref><b>,</b> aggregation platform <b>102-1</b> and aggregation platform <b>102-2.</b> Each instance of an aggregation platform <b>102</b> must itself be identified by an aggregation identifier, denoted in <figref idref="f0004">fig. <b>4</b></figref> as aggregatorlD. In case platform <b>102</b> is integrated into another platform <b>102,</b> both constituting the functionality of one platform <b>102,</b> then the aggregation identifier can be a complex aggregation identifier. Aggregation platform <b>102-1</b> is identified by aggregatorlD: agg<b>1</b> and Aggregation platform <b>102-2</b> is identified<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> by aggregatorlD: agg<b>2</b>. The aggregation identifier is indicative of at least a geographic location of the associated aggregation platform. The geographic location includes an indication of the territory or area in which the aggregation platform <b>102</b> is located. Upon receipt of the aggregation identifier later by the AAP <b>301,</b> the AAP <b>301</b> can obtain data on the geographic location of platform <b>102.</b></p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The aggregation platforms <b>102</b> are aggregated into the AAP <b>301.</b> The aggregation platforms <b>102</b> operatively communicating with the AAP <b>301</b> and AAP <b>301</b> are configured to obtain from each platform <b>102</b> the one or more content identifiers and RGS identifiers received at platform <b>102</b> from each RGS <b>103.</b> In addition, AAP <b>301</b> is configured to obtain from platform <b>102</b> the aggregation identifier of the platform itself.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">After receiving data from platform <b>102,</b> AAP <b>301</b> is configured to generate, for each stored piece of content, a respective unique path identifier based on the associated content identifier, the RGS identifier and the aggregation identifier. Using a coordinate system that describes the geographic location of a specific piece of content, <b>104</b> the unique path identifier can include a structure of a chain of coordinates of the entities involved in the piece of content. For example, the structure can include coordinates such as (aggregatorld, rgsType, rgsID, gameld). The predefined order assists the AAP <b>301</b> to accurately and deterministically locate a specific piece of content <b>104</b> in a logical manner, in the complex network of an aggregated content system. For example, in order to identify the game <b>104,</b> with content identifier (gameID) "1", provided by the RGS <b>103</b> associated with RGS identifier "provider_<b>1</b>", that is aggregated by the aggregation platform <b>102</b> identified by aggregation identifier as "agg<b>1</b>", AAP <b>301</b> is configured to generate a unique path identifier of: ("agg<b>1</b>", "provider_<b>1</b>", "gs<b>1_1</b>", "<b>1</b>"). Chaining the identifiers of all entities to generate the unique path identifier assures that path identifier is indeed unique. It is to be noted that although there could exist several games with content identifiers "<b>1</b>" and several RGS <b>103</b> with an RGS identifier "provider_<b>1</b>", "gs<b>1_1</b>", each respective unique path,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> which includes also the different aggregation identifiers, will be unique to AAP <b>301</b> generating the path identifier.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">In some examples, the structure includes coordinates of entities in the network, in a predefined order. For example, the order can include :"aggregation identifier", "RGS identifier", "content identifier"). In some examples, the RGS identifier includes the RGS type and/or the RGS instance. The structure of the unique path identifier, based on coordinates in a specific order, inherently indicates the exact location of a piece of content, in a logical manner. The logical location of a piece of content indicates the location of the piece of content within the network, i.e. which entities are involved in order to communicate data to that piece of content (as opposed to the physical location of storing the actual content, in terms of GPS coordinates of the RGS <b>103).</b></p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">Moreover, a predefined order of coordinates can describe the parent-child relationship of aggregator platforms in the network, such that the structure of the unique path identifier indicates the logical path of entities in the network from the AAP <b>301</b> to the RGS <b>103</b> storing the specific piece of content, that should be followed, in order to communicate data to that piece of content <b>104.</b> The logical location of the piece of content <b>104</b> and the indication of the path of entities that are involved from the AAP <b>301</b> to the particular RGS that stored that piece of content <b>104,</b> is to be referred to as a logical geographic location of the piece of content <b>104.</b> The discovery process is further described below with relation to <figref idref="f0005">Fig. <b>5</b></figref><b>.</b></p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">After the AAP <b>301</b> generates the unique path identifier, it is configured to use the generated unique path identifier to facilitate communicating data, e.g. to send or receive data, that pertains to the piece of content identified by the generated unique path identifier.

For example, in order to identify the game <b>104,</b> with content identifier (gameID) <b>"1",</b> provided by the RGS <b>103</b> associated with RGS identifier "provider_<b>1</b>", that is aggregated by the aggregation platform <b>102</b> identified by aggregation identifier as "agg<b>1</b>", AAP <b>301</b> generates a unique path identifier of: ("agg<b>1</b>", "provider_<b>1</b>", "gs<b>1_1</b>", <b>"1"</b>). Chaining the identifiers of all entities to generate the unique path identifier assures that the path identifier is indeed unique. It is to be noted that although there could exist several games with content identifiers <b>"1"</b> and several RGS <b>103</b> with an RGS identifier "provider_<b>1</b>","gs<b>1_1</b>", each respective unique path will be unique to AAP <b>301</b> generating the path identifier.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In some examples, the structure includes coordinates of entities in the network, in a predefined order. For example, the order can include "aggregation identifier", "RGS identifier", and "content identifier". In some examples, the RGS<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> identifier includes the RGS type and/or the RGS instance. The structure of the unique path identifier, based on coordinates in a specific order, inherently indicates the exact location of a piece of content, in a logical manner. The logical location of a piece of content indicates the location of the piece of content within the network, i.e. which entities are involved in order to communicate data to that piece of content (as opposed to the physical location of storing the actual content, in terms of GPS coordinates of the RGS <b>103).</b></p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Moreover, a predefined order of coordinates can describe the parent-child relationship of aggregator platforms in the network, such that the structure of the unique path identifier indicates the logical path of entities in the network from the AAP <b>301</b> to the RGS <b>103</b> storing the specific piece of content, that should be followed, in order to communicate data to that piece of content <b>104.</b> The logical location of the piece of content <b>104</b> and the indication of the path of entities to the RGS within it, is referred to as a logical geographic location of the piece of content <b>104.</b></p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">After the AAP <b>301</b> generates the unique path identifier, the AAP <b>301</b> uses the generated unique path identifier to facilitate communicating data, e.g. to send or receive data, that pertains to the piece of content identified by the generated unique path identifier (block <b>550).</b> Since the unique path identifier constitutes a path, the AAP <b>301</b> can use the unique path identifier to communicate data to the particular RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular piece of content <b>104</b> for implementation and/or configuration, through all the entities on the path, e.g. the platform.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Reference is now made to <figref idref="f0006">Fig. <b>6</b></figref> illustrating a flowchart of operations carried out by the AAP <b>301,</b> in accordance with certain embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">In the hierarchal network illustrated above, the processor of the AAP <b>301</b> operatively communicates with one or more aggregation platforms <b>102,</b> and each of the one or more aggregation platforms <b>102</b> is associated with an aggregation identifier indicative of at least a geographic location of the associated aggregation platform. In<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> addition, there is provided at least one RGS <b>103</b> configured for storing at least one piece of content <b>104.</b> Each of the at least one RGS <b>103</b> is associated with an RGS identifier indicative of at least a geographic location of the associated RGS <b>103.</b> RGS <b>103</b> is configured to operatively communicate with a designated aggregation platform <b>102</b> of the one or more aggregation platforms <b>102.</b></p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">In some examples, in order for the AAP <b>301</b> to identify the location of a piece of content, the AAP <b>301,</b> e.g. using its processor, obtains from each of the one or more aggregation platforms <b>102</b> the associated aggregation identifier (block <b>610).</b> For example, the AAP <b>301</b> issues a discovery process querying each operatively communicating platform <b>102</b> for its aggregation identifier. Alternatively or additionally, once an aggregation platform <b>102</b> is operatively communicating to AAP <b>301,</b> the aggregation platform <b>102</b> sends to the AAP <b>301</b> its respective aggregation identifier, and the AAP <b>301</b> stores in a database the aggregation identifiers of the aggregation platform <b>102</b> that operatively communicated with the AAP <b>301.</b> Obtaining from each of the one or more aggregation platforms the associated aggregation identifier can include retrieving from the database the aggregation identifiers of the aggregation platform <b>102</b> that is operatively communicating to AAP <b>301</b> (block <b>610).</b></p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">For each platform that is operatively communicating with AAP <b>301,</b> AAP <b>301</b> further obtains, through the aggregation platform <b>102,</b> a list of all RGSs <b>103</b> that are operatively communicating with that platform <b>102,</b> and their respective RGS identifiers (block <b>620).</b> For example, the list includes at least one RGS identifier of at least one RGS <b>103</b> that is operatively communicating with aggregation platform <b>102.</b></p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Each platform obtains from the RGSs <b>103</b> that are operatively communicating with the designated platform <b>102,</b> a list of all pieces of content <b>104</b> that are stored on each RGS <b>103,</b> and their associated content identifiers. Hence, AAP <b>301</b> obtains, through each of the aggregation platform <b>102</b> and the RGS <b>103,</b> associated content identifiers for pieces of content <b>104</b> stored in each RGS <b>103</b> (block <b>630).</b> For example, AAP <b>301</b><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> obtains at least one content identifier associated with at least one piece of content <b>104</b> stored on an RGS <b>103.</b></p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">Based on the obtained associated content identifier, the obtained RGS identifier and the obtained aggregation identifier, AAP <b>301</b> generates a respective unique path identifier for each of the stored at least one piece of content. The unique path identifier is for identifying a logical geographic location of each of the stored at least one piece of content (block <b>640).</b> The AAP <b>301</b> can then use the generated unique path identifier, to facilitate communicating data that pertains to the piece of content identified by the unique path identifier (block <b>650).</b> The data can be issued from the AAP <b>301</b> or received from other systems or network entities that communicate with the AAP <b>301,</b> and be sent to the RGS <b>103</b> storing the piece of content. For example, the data pertains to one or more characteristics of the content.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As described above, in some examples, each content <b>104</b> is associated with <b>characteristics.</b> For example, for a content <b>104</b> being a game, the characteristics of the content can include <b>operational parameters</b> of the game or <b>configuration characteristics</b> of the game. Operational parameters of the game include for example, versioning information of the game, game paytable (RTF (return to player) information, software package version, list of currencies the game is playable in, list of languages the game supports, etc. <b>Configuration characteristics</b> of the game can include <b>configuration parameters and/or other requirements.</b> In some examples, different instances of content require specific types of <b>configuration parameters</b> that are often unique to the content itself. Examples of configuration parameters of a slot machine game content may include (but are not limited to): Maximum Bet, Minimum Bet, Available bet sizes/coin sizes, Free bet sizes/coin sizes, and Feature enabling flags. In contrast, configuration parameters of a table game such as Blackjack may include (but not be limited to): Number of decks, Number of cards per deck, Insurance allowed, and Double Down Bet allowed.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Due to almost infinite possibilities of combining individual configuration parameters, and the fact that it is impossible to predict the required configuration parameters by a specific game, in some examples an RGS <b>103</b> is configured to provide specific configuration capabilities, per game. To address this complexity and enable an RGS <b>103</b> to provide configuration capabilities and implement configuration to parameters of a game, the game is configured to generate data describing its configuration parameters. Alternatively, the data describing the configuration parameters can automatically be generated by using known standards in the field, such as the descriptive JSON Schema standard. The data describing the configuration parameters as well as the required structure of the configuration parameters is referred to herein as configuration schema of the content <b>104.</b> For example, the configuration schema includes the characteristics described above, including Maximum Bet, Minimum Bet, Available bet sizes/coin sizes and such. Configuration schema can also describe other secondary parameters such as labels, comments, data-type identifiers, related values and so forth. Once a <b>configuration schema</b> is generated, the RGS <b>103</b> is configured to store the <b>configuration schema</b> and associate between the relevant content and its <b>configuration schema.</b> In some examples, the RGS <b>103</b> also configures the game <b>103</b> based on its associated <b>configuration schema, e.g. by updating</b> the configuration parameters of the game.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">The <b>configuration schema</b> can be retrieved by the RGS <b>103</b> at any time during a discovery process, a continuous update, or upon demand, and be sent together with the content identifier to the platform <b>102</b> and eventually to the AAP <b>301.</b> The <b>configuration schema</b> can be provided to entities of the network, and can be used e.g. for analytics, for configuring game parameters by operators <b>107</b> etc. In some examples, the <b>configuration schema</b> can be provided to operators or clients or the game, for setting configuration updates, which are later validated, e.g. by the RGS <b>103</b> versus the configuration schema. Once receiving configuration updates, the AAP <b>301</b> uses the unique path identifier for applying the configuration updates, for example, by<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> sending the configuration updates to the particular RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular game <b>104,</b> for which updates were received, so the RGS <b>103</b> can apply the confirmation updates to the game accordingly. Using the unique path identifier is advantageously such that it enables the AAP <b>301</b> to communicate the updates to the particular RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular game <b>104</b> in the network.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">Bearing this in mind, reference is made to <figref idref="f0007">Fig. <b>7</b></figref> illustrating the process of configuring <b>configuration schema.</b> Some stages of <figref idref="f0007">Fig. <b>7</b></figref> refer to stages illustrated in relation to <figref idref="f0006">Fig. <b>6</b></figref><b>.</b> As such, in blocks <b>610</b> and <b>620,</b> AAP <b>301</b> obtaining an aggregation identifier from platform <b>102</b> and an RGS identifier from RGS <b>103</b> through aggregation platform <b>102</b> are illustrated. Each RGS <b>103</b> is configured to provide a list of pieces of content <b>104</b> stored within the RGS <b>103,</b> and hence, during the discovery process, AAP <b>301</b> is configured to obtain at least one content identifier, wherein each content identifier is indicative of characteristics of the content (block <b>630).</b> In some examples, where a configuration schema was generated e.g. by the content <b>104</b> itself and was stored and associated with the content <b>104,</b> e.g. by the RGS <b>103,</b> then AAP <b>301</b> is configured to obtain also configuration schema associated with the content <b>104</b> (block <b>710).</b> For example, RGS <b>103</b> can send the configuration schema associated with a content <b>104</b> to AAP <b>301</b> through the platform <b>102.</b> In some examples, AAP <b>301</b> obtains the configuration schema during the discovery process. Alternatively or additionally, AAP <b>301</b> obtains the configuration schema associated with the particular content <b>104,</b> based on the respective content identifier, upon request. For example, AAP <b>301</b> can send a specific request to a particular RGS <b>103</b> storing a particular content <b>104</b> with an associated content identifier, to obtain the configuration schema associated with that particular content <b>104.</b></p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">AAP <b>301</b> can generate a respective unique path identifier (block <b>640).</b> AAP <b>301</b> then uses the generated unique path identifier (block <b>650),</b> for example, AAP <b>301</b> provides data on a stored content <b>104</b> and associated configuration schema (block <b>720).</b> In some examples, AAP <b>301</b> displays a list of one or more games and their<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> associated configuration schema to operators, e.g. operators <b>107</b> illustrated in relation to <figref idref="f0001">Fig. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="f0002"><b>2</b></figref><b>.</b> The operators <b>107</b> can then insert or update data relating to the configuration, based on the configuration schema, and send such data to AAP <b>301.</b> For example, update to the configuration, based on the configuration schema, includes revising/editing/adding/disabling/removing and updating values of any configuration parameters and/or requirements. AAP <b>301</b> obtains the updated configuration (block <b>730),</b> e.g. by receiving it from operators <b>107.</b> AAP <b>103</b> can then apply the updated configuration (block <b>740).</b> For example, AAP <b>301</b> sends the updated configuration to the RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular piece of content <b>104</b> associated with the configuration schema, by sending the updated configuration to the aggregation platform <b>102,</b> which in turn, sends the updated configuration to the RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular piece of content <b>104.</b> Sending the updated configuration can be done using the unique path identifier associated with the particular piece of content <b>104.</b></p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The process of updating configuration associated with the content <b>104</b> can be done when the operator initially selects the content <b>104</b> to be added to his portfolio, or upon request, after the content <b>104</b> has already been added, and the operator <b>107</b> then chooses to update the configuration, based on the configuration schema that was provided by the RGS <b>103.</b> Using the unique path identifier is advantageously such that it enables the AAP <b>301</b> to communicate the updates to the particular RGS <b>103</b> storing the particular game <b>104</b> in the network.</p>
