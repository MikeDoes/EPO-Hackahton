<heading id="h0003"><u>Technical Field</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hot melt adhesive composition including a block copolymer composition and a method of preparing the same.</p>
<heading id="h0004">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">A hot melt adhesive, which is an adhesive using a thermoplastic resin to be melted by heat, thereby forming an adhesive surface, does not use a volatile solvent or the like unlike a conventional UV-curable adhesive to emit less of a harmful substance upon curing, and thus, is preferred as an environment-friendly highly functional adhesive.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The hot melt adhesive is lower-priced than a UV-curable adhesive and is present in a liquid state at a high temperature, and thus, is easily applied and compressed on a substrate and an adherend, and then is cooled and solidified at room temperature within several seconds to exert adhesive strength, and thus, is easily used.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Since the hot melt adhesive is applied to an adherend in a melted state and then cooled to form a hard phase having cohesiveness and creep resistance, the hot melt adhesive is widely used in various industrial fields of industry, such as, diapers or feminine hygiene products, manufacture of pressure sensitive adhesive electronic products such as industrial tape or packaging tape, structural materials, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Since the hot melt adhesive includes a base resin, an additive, and the like, phase separation and bleeding occur due to compatibility and the like to decrease adhesive strength, a relatively high temperature condition is required during melting processing for adhesion due to high viscosity, and in particular, at the processing temperature condition as such, problems such as viscosity change, odor generation, and discoloration may occur, and thus, a demand for a low-viscosity product is increased.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, development of a hot melt adhesive which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> maintains low-viscosity properties, may improve processing processability, and has excellent adhesive strength and thermal resistance and also excellent physical properties after curing is demanded.</p>
<heading id="h0005">[Disclosure]</heading>
<heading id="h0006">[Technical Problem]</heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention was contrived for solving the problems of the background art, and the object of the present invention is to provide a hot melt adhesive composition which has a high softening point so that it may be applied at a high temperature, and also may improve adhesion.</p>
<heading id="h0007">[Technical Solution]</heading>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In one general aspect, a hot melt adhesive composition includes: a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and a conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit; a triblock copolymer which is a coupled polymer of the diblock copolymer; and a crosslinked block copolymer including a crosslinking agent-derived crosslinked part crosslinked with two or more of the diblock copolymers and the triblock copolymers, wherein the conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit includes an isoprene-derived unit and an epoxidized isoprene rubber<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> represented by the following Chemical Formula 1:
<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="51" he="30" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In another general aspect, a method of preparing a hot melt adhesive composition includes: polymerizing a styrene-based monomer in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent and a polymerization initiator to prepare a styrene-based monomer block (S10); polymerizing the styrene-based monomer block and isoprene to prepare a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and an isoprene-derived unit (S20); coupling two or more of the diblock copolymers and a coupling agent to prepare a triblock copolymer, thereby preparing a block copolymer composition including the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer (S30); reacting a part of the isoprene-derived unit included in the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid to substitute a part of the isoprene-derived unit with an epoxidized isoprene unit (S40); and crosslinking two or more of the triblock copolymers and the diblock copolymers including the epoxidized isoprene unit with a crosslinking agent to prepare a crosslinked block<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> copolymer (S50).</p>
<heading id="h0008">[Advantageous Effects]</heading>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The hot melt adhesive composition including a diblock copolymer, a triblock copolymer, and a crosslinked block copolymer thereof according to the present invention has improved performance required at a high temperature such as high temperature stability and viscosity retention properties at a high temperature, simultaneously with improved adhesive strength, by functionalizing a part of a conjugated diene-based monomer unit forming a conjugated diene-based monomer block of a copolymer with an epoxy group.</p>
<heading id="h0009">[Best Mode]</heading>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail for better understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Since the present invention may be variously modified and may have various forms, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to a specific disclosed form, but includes all of the modifications, equivalents, and substitutions within the spirit and technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, the terms and words used in the description and the claims of the present invention are not to be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> construed limitedly as having general or dictionary meanings but are to be construed as having meanings and concepts meeting the technical ideas of the present invention, based on a principle that the inventors are able to appropriately define the concepts of terms in order to describe their own inventions in the best mode.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, the terms and the measurement methods used in the present invention may be construed as defined in the following, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Meanwhile, the term, a "monomer-derived repeating unit" or a "monomer-derived unit" in the present invention may refer to a component or a structure resulting from a monomer, or the material itself, or may refer to a unit which is formed in a polymer by the monomer introduced participating a polymerization reaction during polymerization. Furthermore, not only the case in which two or more monomer-derived units are repeated but also the case in which the number of monomer-derived unit is one may be expressed as the monomer-derived repeating unit.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The term "block" in the present invention represents a form of a polymer chain formed by block polymerizing monomers, and may refer to a form in which a plurality of monomer-derived units are continuously connected. For example, a styrene-based monomer block may refer to a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> polymer chain formed by block polymerization of a styrene-based monomer or an assembly of a plurality of styrene-based monomer-derived units. The term "polymer block" in the present invention may refer to a bundle of polymer chains formed by block polymerization of a monomer.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">A hot melt adhesive composition according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include a diblock copolymer, a triblock copolymer, and a crosslinked block copolymer in a crosslinked form of two or more thereof by a crosslinking agent. More specifically, the hot melt adhesive composition according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and a conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit, a triblock copolymer which is a coupled polymer of the diblock copolymer, and a crosslinked block copolymer including a crosslinking agent-derived crosslinked part crosslinked with two or more of the diblock copolymers and the triblock copolymers.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The diblock copolymer is a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and a conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit, and the conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit may include an isoprene-derived unit and an epoxidized isoprene unit represented by the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> following Chemical Formula 1:
<chemistry id="chem0002" num="0002"><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="51" he="30" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">More specifically, the diblock copolymer may be a diblock copolymer which includes a styrene-based monomer block (S) including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and a conjugated diene-based monomer block (I) including an isoprene-derived unit, in the form of (S)-(I-EI) in which a part of the isoprene-derived unit is functionalized with an epoxy group to be substituted by an epoxidized isoprene unit (EI) represented by Chemical Formula 1.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The triblock copolymer is a coupled polymer prepared by a coupling reaction of two or more diblock copolymers, and representatively, may be a triblock copolymer in the form of (S)-(I-EI)-(S). Meanwhile, the triblock copolymer may further include a coupling agent-derived unit between the conjugated diene-based monomer block (I-EI) and the styrene-based monomer block (S) depending on a coupling agent or a coupling manner.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">Meanwhile, the crosslinked block copolymer is a block copolymer which is a crosslinked block copolymer in which two or more of the diblock copolymers and the triblock<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> copolymers are crosslinked by a crosslinking agent, and may include a crosslinking agent-derived crosslinked part in a crosslinked area of the crosslinking agent with the diblock copolymer or the triblock copolymer.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The crosslinking agent includes two or more functional groups which are crosslinkable with the epoxidized isoprene unit represented by Chemical Formula 1 included in the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer, and may include a hydroxyl group or an amine group at both ends of the crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent may be polyalkylene glycol, alkylene glycol, or alkylene diamine, and specifically, may be polyethylene glycol or ethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">A styrene-based monomer for forming the styrene-based monomer-derived unit may be styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, para-methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl naphthalene, para-butyl styrene, or a combination thereof, and specifically styrene.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The styrene-based monomer-derived unit may be produced by polymerization of the styrene-based monomer, and the styrene-based monomer-derived unit included in the hot melt adhesive composition may be included at 10 to 20 parts by weight, specifically 13 to 18 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the block copolymers<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> including the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Since a glass transition temperature (Tg) value of the styrene-based monomer is higher than room temperature, the styrene-based monomer may form a segment unit having a relatively hard nature in the copolymer. Therefore, when a content of the styrene-based monomer-derived unit is 10 parts by weight or more, mechanical physical properties such as hardness of the hot melt adhesive composition including the styrene-based monomer-derived unit may be improved, and simultaneously thermal resistance may be maintained. In addition, when the content of the styrene-based monomer-derived unit is 20 parts by weight or less, an excessive viscosity increase of the hot melt adhesive composition may be suppressed to increase processability, and simultaneously a problem of decreased adhesive strength may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Meanwhile, as described above, in the conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit of the present invention, it is more advantageous for the conjugated diene-based monomer to include isoprene than to include 1,3-butadiene, in terms of adhesion performance of implementing high adhesive property and peel strength as an adhesive blend.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, in the hot melt adhesive composition<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> including the conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit in which a part of the isoprene-derived unit is substituted by an epoxidized isoprene unit represented by Chemical formula 1, a phenomenon in which a viscosity of an adhesive is decreased when storing the composition at a high temperature for a long time is prevented, thereby maintaining desired adhesion properties at a high temperature for a longer time. Thus, high thermal stability and good adhesive property may coexist.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">From this point of view, the epoxidized isoprene unit included in the hot melt adhesive composition may be included at 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, specifically 1 to 3 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the isoprene-derived unit and the epoxidized isoprene unit. When a content of the epoxidized isoprene unit is 5 parts by weight or less, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the isoprene-derived unit and the epoxidized isoprene unit, viscosity is even increased during storing at a high temperature, so that deterioration of storage and high temperature storage properties may be prevented. Meanwhile, when the content of the epoxidized isoprene unit is 0.5 parts by weight or more, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the isoprene-derived unit and the epoxidized isoprene unit, a decrease in viscosity of the adhesive<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> during storage at a high temperature for a long time is prevented.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Meanwhile, the diblock copolymer may be included at 15 to 25 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the triblock copolymer may be prepared by performing a coupling reaction on the diblock copolymer including the styrene-based monomer-derived unit and the conjugated diene-based monomer-derived unit, and in this process, a diblock copolymer which does not participate in the coupling reaction may remain and be included in the hot melt adhesive composition. That is, the hot melt adhesive composition of the present invention may include a triblock copolymer and a diblock copolymer which remains without participating in the coupling reaction.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Meanwhile, when a content of the diblock copolymer is within the range, viscosity may be appropriately increased and excellent thermal resistance properties may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Meanwhile, the triblock copolymer according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be a coupled polymer of the diblock copolymer, and an example of the coupling agent may be a silane derivative such as<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> dimethylchlorosilane, tetrachlorosilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, and tetramethoxysilane.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The hot melt adhesive composition according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may further include a blend for a hot melt adhesive of one or more selected from the group consisting of a tackifier, a plastic oil, and an antioxidant.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">A block copolymer including the diblock copolymer, the triblock copolymer, and the crosslinked block copolymer may be included at 10 to 40 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive composition.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The tackifier included in the hot melt adhesive composition may include any one or more of an at least partially hydrogenated rosin ester-based compound and an at least partially hydrogenated dicyclopentadiene-based polymerized petroleum resin. Herein, a rosin has a concept including all of an abietic acid, a dehydroabietic acid in which hydrogen is removed from an abietic acid, and a dihydroabietic acid or a tetrahydroabietic acid to which two or four hydrogens are added, and the abietic acid and the dihydroabietic acid to which two hydrogens are added are used to have a concept of including all various isomers, depending on a position of a double bond.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The rosin ester-based compound is formed by reacting a carboxyl group of an abietic acid with an OH group of alcohol or polyol to be esterified, based on the abietic acid described above or a hydrogenated abietic acid structure, and this also includes all esterified products of natural rosin or modified rosin. The alcohol or polyol is an aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, may be in the form of monoalcohol, diol, triol, tetraol, or pentaol, and more specifically, for example, may be methanol, ethanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, pentaerythritol, or the like. When polyol is used, the abietic acid may be esterified with an entire or a part of a hydroxyl group of polyol, and thus, monoester, divalent ester such as diester, ternary ester, or quaternary ester may be formed.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">Meanwhile, the dicyclopentadiene-based polymerization petroleum resin may refer to a petroleum resin including C9-dicyclopentadiene prepared from C5, that is, a cyclopentadiene oil, produced as a by-product in a naphtha cracking process in which naphtha obtained by crude oil refining is decomposed at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The cyclopentadiene produced in the naphtha cracking process is, in most cases, dimerized to be present as a dicyclopentadiene structure, and the cyclopentadiene and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the dicyclopentadiene as the dimer thereof may be mutually converted to each other by a Diels-Alder reaction and a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, and in particular, the cyclopentadiene may be polymerized into the dicyclopentadiene by thermal polymerization or catalyst polymerization. Therefore, the expression that the tackifier used in the present invention includes a partially-hydrogenated dicyclopentadiene-based polymerized petroleum resin may mean that at least a part of dicyclopentadiene of the dicyclopentadiene-based compound included in the dicyclopentadiene-based polymerized petroleum resin described above is hydrogenated so that both dicyclopentane and dicyclopentadiene are included.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the tackifier may be included at about 200 to about 400 parts by weight or about 250 to about 350 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the block copolymers including the diblock copolymer, the triblock copolymer, and the crosslinked block copolymer. When the tackifier is included too little, a tackifying effect is insignificant, so that adhesion-related physical properties are not sufficiently exhibited in the hot melt adhesive composition, and when too much of the tackifier is included, cohesion of an adhesive component is decreased,<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> so that in this case also, adhesion-related physical properties may be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Furthermore, the plastic oil included in the hot melt adhesive composition may include a petroleum-based mineral oil. The petroleum-based mineral oil is a liquid by-product produced in a process of refining crude oil into petroleum and also called liquid paraffin and representatively, includes a paraffinic oil based on n-alkane, a naphthenic oil based on cycloalkane, and an aromatic oil based on an aromatic hydrocarbon, and in the present invention, the petroleum-based mineral oil has a concept of including both the oils described above and modified oils thereof. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the petroleum-based mineral oil is preferably a paraffinic oil, and more preferably, a white oil which is modified by hydrotreatment and/or dewaxing in the presence of a catalyst, or the like.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Meanwhile, the plastic oil may be included at about 50 to about 150 parts by weight, preferably about 70 to about 130 parts by weight, or about 90 to about 110 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the block copolymers including the diblock copolymer, the triblock copolymer, and the crosslinked block copolymer. When a content of the plastic oil is too low, flowability<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> and low-temperature processability may be deteriorated, and when the content of the plastic oil is too high, viscosity is excessively increased to rather deteriorate adhesion performance.</p>

<p id="p0045" num="0045">A method of preparing a hot melt adhesive composition<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">The method of preparing a hot melt adhesive composition of the present invention may include: polymerizing a styrene-based monomer in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent and a polymerization initiator to prepare a styrene-based monomer block (S10), polymerizing the styrene-based monomer block and isoprene to prepare a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and an isoprene-derived unit (S20), coupling two or more of the diblock copolymers and a coupling agent to prepare a triblock copolymer, thereby preparing a block copolymer composition including the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer (S30), reacting a part of the isoprene-derived unit included in the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid to substitute a part of the isoprene-derived unit with an epoxidized isoprene unit (S40), and crosslinking two or more of the triblock copolymers and the diblock copolymers including the epoxidized isoprene unit with a crosslinking agent to prepare a crosslinked block copolymer (S50).</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">First, a step S10 is a step of polymerizing a styrene-based monomer to prepare a styrene-based monomer block, and<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the kind of styrene-based monomer may be the same as the kind of styrene-based monomer for forming the styrene-based monomer-derived unit described above.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The hydrocarbon solvent is not particularly limited as long as it does not react with a polymerization initiator and is usually used in a polymerization reaction, but for example, may be one or more selected from the group consisting of linear or branched hydrocarbon compounds such as butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, or isooctane; alkyl-substituted or unsubstituted cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methyl cyclohexane, and methyl cycloheptane; and alkyl-substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and naphthalene.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In addition, the hydrocarbon solvent may include a polar additive for adjusting a vinyl content and improving a polymerization rate, and the polar additive may be for example, one or more selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, tetramethyl ethylene diamine, and benzofuran.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition, the polymerization initiator is not particularly limited as long as it is usually used in anionic polymerization, but for example, may be one or more selected from the group consisting of n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> tert-butyllithium, methyllithium, ethyllithium, isopropyllithium, cyclohexyllithium, allyllithium, vinyllithium, phenyllithium, and benzyllithium.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">Next, a step S20 of polymerizing the styrene-based monomer block prepared as described above and isoprene to prepare a diblock copolymer including a styrene-based monomer-derived unit and an isoprene-derived unit, may be performed. In the present step, the styrene-based monomer block and isoprene may be polymerized in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent and a polymerization initiator, in which the kinds of hydrocarbon solvent and polymerization initiator may be the same as the kind of hydrocarbon solvent and polymerization initiator used in the step S10.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Next, a step of coupling two or more of the diblock copolymers and a coupling agent to prepare a triblock copolymer may be performed. In this process, as described above, a diblock copolymer which does not participate in the coupling reaction may remain and be included in the hot melt adhesive composition. That is, the hot melt adhesive composition of the present invention may include a block copolymer composition including a triblock copolymer and a diblock copolymer which remains without participating in the coupling reaction together.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">The coupling agent derives a coupling reaction between the diblock copolymers, and may be a vinyl group-containing hydrocarbon-based compound such as divinylbenzene; an ester-based compound such as diethyl adipate and glycidyl methacrylate; a silane compound such as dimethyldichlorosilane, tetrachlorosilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, and tetramethoxysilane, as a polyfunctional coupling agent.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">Here, the coupling reaction may be performed, for example, under the conditions of a temperature of 30°C to 150°C or 60°C to 130°C and a pressure of 0.1 bar to 10 bar or 0.5 bar to 5 bar, and within the range, the coupling reaction may be stably performed.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Subsequently, a step S40 of substituting a part of the isoprene-derived unit included in the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer with an epoxidized isoprene unit may be performed.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">This step may be performed by reacting the isoprene-derived unit included in the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The carboxylic acid may be one or more selected from the group consisting of a formic acid, an acetic acid, a<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> trifluoroacetic acid, a benzyloxyformic acid, a dinitrobenzoic acid, and a metachlorobenzoic acid.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Here, the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid may include the hydrogen peroxide and the carboxylic acid at a mole ratio of 1:0.8 to 1:3, 1:1 to 1:2, or 1:1.2 to 1:1.7. Within the range, epoxidation of a part of the isoprene-derived unit may be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Meanwhile, the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid may be used at 0.01 mol to 0.4 mol, specifically 0.02 mol to 0.15 mol, or 0.05 mol to 0.1 mol, based on 1 mol of the isoprene-derived unit included in the triblock copolymer and the diblock copolymer, and within the range, a crosslinking reaction between polymer block chains does not occur to prevent deterioration of physical properties, some isoprene-derived units may be easily epoxidized, and an epoxidation ratio may be controlled to an appropriate range, thereby improving high temperature stability of the hot melt adhesive composition.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">An appropriate range of the epoxidation ratio may be a range in which the epoxidized isoprene unit included in the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer is included at 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, based on a total of 100 parts by weight of the isoprene-derived unit and the epoxidized isoprene unit. Within the range, an excessive decrease or<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> excessive increase in viscosity during storage of the hot melt adhesive composition at a high temperature for a long time may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Next, a step S50 of crosslinking two or more of the diblock copolymers and the triblock copolymers including the epoxidized isoprene unit by a crosslinking agent to prepare a crosslinked block copolymer may be performed.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">Specifically, the step S50 may be performed by adding the crosslinking agent during a process of blending the blend for a hot melt adhesive and the block copolymer composition after the step S40. More specifically, a time to add the crosslinking agent may be a time when 70% of an entire period of the blending process has passed, 80% has passed, or 85% has passed from the starting point, that is, a time when 30% of the entire period of the blending process has left, 20% has left, or 15% has left from the time of blending completion.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">As an example, the blending process may be performed for a total of 1 hour to 2 hours, 1.2 hours to 1.8 hours, or 1.4 hours to 1.6 hours, and a time to add the crosslinking agent may be 30 minutes, 15 minutes, or 10 minutes before completing the blending process.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Meanwhile, for example, when the crosslinking agent is added at the beginning of blending of the blend for a hot<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> melt adhesive and the block copolymer composition after the step S40, that is, before 50% has passed from the starting point, the crosslinking reaction starts too early to form too much of a crosslinked product, and viscosity may be excessively decreased or excessively increased during storage of the hot melt adhesive composition at a high temperature for a long time.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">The blend for a hot melt adhesive may include one or more selected from the group consisting of a tackifier, a plastic oil, and an antioxidant. Specifically, the blend for a hot melt adhesive may include all of the tackifier, the plastic oil, and the antioxidant.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a process of mixing the blend for a hot melt adhesive at 100 to 250°C, 120 to 200°C, or 150 to 180°C may be further performed, before blending the blend for a hot melt adhesive and the block copolymer composition after the step S40.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The crosslinking agent is as described above, and may be used at a mole ratio of 0.1 to 1 or 0.3 to 0.7 relative to 1 mol of the epoxidized isoprene unit included in the block copolymer. Within the range, an excessive decrease or increase in viscosity during storage of the hot melt adhesive composition at a high temperature for a long time<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> may be prevented.</p>

<p id="p0099" num="0099">As confirmed in Tables 2 and 3, it was confirmed that the Examples of the present invention in which a part of the isoprene monomer-derived unit included in the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer is substituted with the epoxidized isoprene-derived unit, and furthermore, during preparation of the hotmelt adhesive composition, a specific crosslinking agent is added to the blending process of the blend for a hot melt adhesive (tackifier, plastic oil, and antioxidant) and the block copolymer composition including the epoxidized isoprene-derived unit (including the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer) to include the crosslinked block copolymer in which two or more of the diblock copolymers and the triblock copolymers are crosslinked, were excellent in terms of the adhesive strength with an adherend and the peel strength while maintaining a high softening point. In addition, it was found that since the property of maintaining viscosity during storage at a high temperature was improved, the compositions of the Examples were suitable for use as an adhesive (Examples 1 to 5).</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">However, the hot melt adhesive composition having no epoxidized isoprene-derived unit (Comparative Example 1)<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> and the hot melt adhesive composition including the epoxidized isoprene-derived unit but no crosslinked block copolymer crosslinked with a specific crosslinking agent (Comparative Examples 2 to 5) had poor peel strength and rapidly decreased viscosity during storage at a high temperature, and thus, were inappropriate for use as a high temperature hot melt adhesive.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">Furthermore, in the case in which the crosslinked block copolymer crosslinked with a specific crosslinking agent was included but the epoxidized isoprene-derived unit is excessively included (Comparative Example 7), viscosity rather increased during storage at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">In addition, in the case in which though the epoxidized isoprene-derived unit was included and the block copolymer crosslinked with a specific crosslinking agent was included, the time to add the specific crosslinking agent was before preparation of the hot melt composition and after epoxidation (Comparative Example 6), it was confirmed that the block copolymer composition including the crosslinked block copolymer crosslinked by polyethylene glycol (PEG) was not dissolved in the blend for a hot melt adhesive (tackifier, plastic oil, and antioxidant) during preparation of the hot melt adhesive composition, and thus, it was impossible to prepare the hot melt adhesive<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> composition.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">In addition, in the case in which a specific crosslinking agent was added to perform crosslinking when the diblock copolymer and the triblock copolymer including no epoxidized isoprene-derived unit were prepared into the hot melt adhesive composition (Comparative Example 8) also, it was confirmed that the peel strength was poor as compared with the Examples, and viscosity maintenance ability during storage at a high temperature was significantly deteriorated.</p>
