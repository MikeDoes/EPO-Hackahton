<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">In some settings, endoscopic surgical instruments may be preferred over traditional open surgical devices since a smaller incision may reduce the post-operative recovery time and complications. Consequently, some endoscopic surgical instruments may be suitable for placement of a distal end effector at a desired surgical site through a cannula of a trocar. These distal end effectors may engage tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter, stapler, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and energy delivery device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.). Endoscopic surgical instruments may include a shaft between the end effector and a handle portion, which is manipulated by the clinician. Such a shaft may enable insertion to a desired depth and rotation about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, thereby facilitating positioning of the end effector within the patient.</p>

In the present example, end effector (80) comprises a blade (82) coupled to the waveguide, a clamp arm (84) operable to pivot at the proximal end of transmission assembly (70), and, optionally, one or more clamp pads (86) coupleable to clamp arm (84). It should also be understood that clamp arm (84) and associated features may be constructed and operable in accordance with at least some of the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0040" dnum="US5980510A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,510</text></patcit>, entitled "Ultrasonic Clamp Coagulator Apparatus Having Improved Clamp Arm Pivot Mount," issued November 9, 1999. The waveguide, which is adapted to transmit ultrasonic energy from a transducer (100) to blade (82), may be flexible, semi-flexible, or rigid. One merely exemplary ultrasonic transducer (100) is Model No. HP054, sold by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio. The waveguide may also be configured to amplify the mechanical vibrations transmitted through the waveguide to blade (82) as is well known in the art. The waveguide may further have features to control the gain of the longitudinal vibration along the waveguide and features to tune the waveguide to the resonant frequency of the system.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present example, the distal end of the blade (82) is disposed near an antinode in order to tune the acoustic assembly to a preferred resonant frequency f<sub>o</sub> when the acoustic assembly is not loaded by tissue. When transducer (100) is energized, the distal end of blade (82) is configured to move longitudinally in the range of, for example, approximately 10 to 500 microns peak-to-peak, and preferably in the range of about 20 to about 200 microns at a predetermined vibratory frequency f<sub>o</sub> of, for example, 55.5 kHz. When transducer (100) of the present example is activated, these mechanical oscillations are transmitted through the waveguide to end effector (80). In the present example, blade (82), being coupled to the waveguide, oscillates at the ultrasonic frequency. Thus, when tissue is secured between blade (82) and clamp arm (84), the ultrasonic oscillation of blade (82) may simultaneously sever the tissue and denature the proteins in adjacent tissue cells, thereby providing a coagulative effect with relatively little thermal spread. An electrical current may also be provided through blade (82) and clamp arm (84) to also<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> cauterize the tissue.

Trigger (164) is pivotable toward and away from pistol grip (162) to selectively actuate end effector (180) as will be described in greater detail below. Activation button (166) is operable to selectively activate RF circuitry that is in communication with end effector (180), in a manner described in <patcit id="pcit0069" dnum="US235660" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/235,660</text></patcit> and/or various other references that are cited herein. In some versions, activation button (166) also serves as a mechanical lockout against trigger (164), such that trigger (164) cannot be fully actuated unless button (166) is being pressed simultaneously. Examples of how such a lockout may be provided are disclosed in one or more of the references cited herein. It should be understood that pistol grip (162), trigger (164), and button (166) may be modified, substituted, supplemented, etc. in any suitable way, and that the descriptions of such components herein are merely illustrative.

<p id="p0028" num="0028">Shaft (170) of the present example includes an outer sheath (172) and an articulation section (176). Articulation section (176) is operable to selectively position end effector (180) at various angles relative to the longitudinal axis defined by sheath (172). Various examples of forms that articulation section (176) and other components of shaft (170) may take are described in <patcit id="pcit0071" dnum="US23562311" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/235,623</text></patcit>, entitled "Control Features for Articulating Surgical Device," filed September 19, 2011. For instance, it should be understood that various components that are operable to actuate articulation section (176) may extend through the interior of sheath (172). In some versions, shaft (170) is also rotatable about the longitudinal axis defined by sheath (172), relative to handpiece (160),<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> via a knob (174). Such rotation may provide rotation of end effector (180) and shaft (170) unitarily. In some other versions, knob (174) is operable to rotate end effector (180) without rotating any portion of shaft (170) that is proximal of articulation section (176). As another merely illustrative example, electrosurgical instrument (159) may include one rotation control that provides rotatability of shaft (170) and end effector (180) as a single unit; and another rotation control that provides rotatability of end effector (180) without rotating any portion of shaft (170) that is proximal of articulation section (176). Other suitable rotation schemes will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Of course, rotatable features may simply be omitted if desired.</p>
<heading id="h0008">B. Exemplary End Effector</heading>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">End effector (180) of the present example comprises a first jaw (182) and a second jaw (184). In the present example, second jaw (184) is substantially fixed relative to shaft (170); while first jaw (182) pivots relative to shaft (170), toward and away from second jaw (184). In some versions, actuators such as rods or cables, etc., may extend through sheath (172) and be joined with first jaw (182) at a pivotal coupling (183), such that longitudinal movement of the actuator rods/cables/etc. through shaft (170) provides pivoting of first jaw (182) relative to shaft (170) and relative to second jaw (184). Of course, jaws (182, 184) may instead have any other suitable kind of movement and may be actuated in any other suitable fashion. By way of example only, and as will be described in greater detail below, jaws (182, 184) may be actuated and thus closed by longitudinal translation of a firing beam (195), such that actuator rods/cables/etc. may simply be eliminated in some versions.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">As best seen in <figref idref="f0005 f0006">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, first jaw (182) defines a longitudinally extending elongate slot (186); while second jaw (184) also defines a longitudinally extending elongate slot (148). In addition, the top side of first jaw (182) presents a first electrode surface (190); while the underside of second jaw (184) presents a second electrode surface (192). Electrode surfaces (190, 192) are in communication with an electrical source (198) via one or more conductors (not shown) that extend along the length of shaft (170). Electrical source (198) is operable to deliver RF energy to first electrode surface<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> (190) at a first polarity and to second electrode surface (192) at a second (opposite) polarity, such that RF current flows between electrode surfaces (190, 192) and thereby through tissue captured between jaws (182, 184). In some versions, firing beam (195) serves as an electrical conductor that cooperates with electrode surfaces (190, 192) (e.g., as a ground return) for delivery of bipolar RF energy captured between jaws (182, 184). Electrical source (198) may be external to electrosurgical instrument (159) or may be integral with electrosurgical instrument (159) (e.g., in handpiece (160), etc.), as described in one or more references cited herein or otherwise. A controller (199) regulates delivery of power from electrical source (198) to electrode surfaces (190, 192). Controller (199) may also be external to electrosurgical instrument (159) or may be integral with electrosurgical instrument (159) (e.g., in handpiece (160), etc.), as described in one or more references cited herein or otherwise. It should also be understood that electrode surfaces (190, 192) may be provided in a variety of alternative locations, configurations, and relationships.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The lower side of first jaw (182) includes a longitudinally extending recess (not shown) adjacent to slot (186); while the upper side of second jaw (184) includes a longitudinally extending recess (not shown) adjacent to slot (188). <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> shows the upper side of first jaw (182) including a plurality of teeth serrations (194). It should be understood that the lower side of second jaw (184) may include complementary serrations that nest with serrations (194), to enhance gripping of tissue captured between jaws (182, 184) without necessarily tearing the tissue.

<p id="p0032" num="0032">With jaws (182, 184) in a closed position, shaft (170) and end effector (180) are sized and configured to fit through trocars having various inner diameters, such that electrosurgical instrument (159) is usable in minimally invasive surgery, though of course electrosurgical instrument (159) could also be used in open procedures if desired. Shaft (170) and end effector (180) may be constructed and operable in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0073" dnum="US235660" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/235,660</text></patcit> and/or various other references that<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> are cited herein.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In some versions, end effector (180) includes one or more sensors (not shown) that are configured to sense a variety of parameters at end effector (180), including but not limited to temperature of adjacent tissue, electrical resistance or impedance of adjacent tissue, voltage across adjacent tissue, forces exerted on jaws (182, 184) by adjacent tissue, etc. By way of example only, end effector (180) may include one or more positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor bodies (e.g., PTC polymer, etc.), located adjacent to electrodes (190, 192) and/or elsewhere. Data from sensors may be communicated to controller (199). Controller (199) may process such data in a variety of ways. By way of example only, controller (199) may modulate or otherwise change the RF energy being delivered to electrode surfaces (190, 192), based at least in part on data acquired from one or more sensors at end effector (180). In addition or in the alternative, controller (199) may alert the user to one or more conditions via an audio and/or visual feedback device (e.g., speaker, lights, display screen, etc.), based at least in part on data acquired from one or more sensors at end effector (180). It should also be understood that some kinds of sensors need not necessarily be in communication with controller (199), and may simply provide a purely localized effect at end effector (180). For instance, a PTC thermistor bodies (not shown) at end effector (40) may automatically reduce the energy delivery at electrode surfaces (190, 192) as the temperature of the tissue and/or end effector (180) increases, thereby reducing the likelihood of overheating. In some such versions, a PTC thermistor element is in series with power source (198) and electrode surface (190, 192); and the PTC thermistor provides an increased impedance (reducing flow of current) in response to temperatures exceeding a threshold. Furthermore, it should be understood that electrode surfaces (190, 192) may be used as sensors (e.g., to sense tissue impedance, etc.). Various kinds of sensors that may be incorporated into electrosurgical instrument (159) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Similarly various things that can be done with data from sensors, by controller (199) or otherwise, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Other suitable variations for end effector (180) will also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p>
<heading id="h0009">C. Exemplary Firing Beam</heading>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">As also seen in <figref idref="f0005 f0006">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, electrosurgical instrument (159) of the present example includes a firing beam (195) that is longitudinally movable along part of the length of end effector (180). Firing beam (195) is coaxially positioned within shaft (170), extends along the length of shaft (170), and translates longitudinally within shaft (170) (including articulation section (176) in the present example), though it should be understood that firing beam (195) and shaft (170) may have any other suitable relationship. Firing beam (195) includes a sharp distal blade (197), an upper flange (196), and a lower flange (not shown). Firing beam (195) may be constructed and operable in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0074" dnum="US235660" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/235,660</text></patcit> and/or various other references that are cited herein. Distal blade (197) extends through slots (186, 188) of jaws (182, 184), with upper flange (196) being located above jaw (184) in a recess (not shown) and the lower flange (not shown) being located below jaw (182) in a recess (not shown). The configuration of distal blade (197), upper flange (196), and the lower flange (not shown) provides an "I-beam" type of cross section at the distal end of firing beam (195) and may be constructed and operable in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0075" dnum="US235660" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/235,660</text></patcit> and/or various other references that are cited herein.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Distal blade (197) is substantially sharp, such that distal blade will readily sever tissue that is captured between jaws (182, 184). Distal blade (197) is also electrically grounded in the present example, providing a return path for RF energy as described elsewhere herein. In some other versions, distal blade (197) serves as an active electrode. In addition or in the alternative, distal blade (197) may be selectively energized with ultrasonic energy (e.g., harmonic vibrations at approximately 55.5 kHz, etc.).</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The "I-beam" type of configuration of firing beam (195) provides closure of jaws (182, 184) as firing beam (195) is advanced distally. In particular, flange (196) urges jaw (184) pivotally toward jaw (182) as firing beam (195) is advanced from a proximal position to a distal position, by bearing against a recess (not shown) formed in jaw (184). This closing effect on jaws (182, 184) by firing beam (195) may occur before distal blade (197) reaches tissue captured between jaws (182, 184). Such staging of encounters by<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> firing beam (195) may reduce the force required to squeeze grip (164) to actuate firing beam (195) through a full firing stroke. In other words, in some such versions, firing beam (195) may have already overcome an initial resistance required to substantially close jaws (182, 184) on tissue before encountering resistance from the tissue captured between jaws (182, 184). Of course, any other suitable staging may be provided.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In the present example, flange (196) is configured to cam against a ramp feature at the proximal end of jaw (184) to open jaw (182) when firing beam (195) is retracted to a proximal position and to hold jaw (182) open when firing beam (195) remains at the proximal position. This camming capability may facilitate use of end effector (180) to separate layers of tissue, to perform blunt dissections, etc., by forcing jaws (182, 184) apart from a closed position. In some other versions, jaws (182, 184) are resiliently biased to an open position by a spring or other type of resilient feature. While jaws (182, 184) close or open as firing beam (195) is translated in the present example, it should be understood that other versions may provide independent movement of jaws (182, 184) and firing beam (195). By way of example only, one or more cables, rods, beams, or other features may extend through shaft (170) to selectively actuate jaws (182, 184) independently of firing beam (195). Such jaw (182, 184) actuation features may be separately controlled by a dedicated feature of handpiece (160). Alternatively, such jaw actuation features may be controlled by trigger (164) in addition to having trigger (164) control firing beam (195). It should also be understood that firing beam (195) may be resiliently biased to a proximal position, such that firing beam (195) retracts proximally when a user relaxes their grip on trigger (164).</p>
<heading id="h0010">D. Exemplary Operation</heading>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In an exemplary use, end effector (180) is inserted into a patient via a trocar. Articulation section (176) is substantially straight when end effector (180) and part of shaft (170) are inserted through the trocar. Articulation control (168) may then be manipulated to pivot or flex articulation section (176) of shaft (170) in order to position end effector (180) at a desired position and orientation relative to an anatomical structure within the patient. Two layers of tissue of the anatomical structure are then captured between jaws (182, 184) by squeezing trigger (164) toward pistol grip (162). Such layers<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> of tissue may be part of the same natural lumen defining anatomical structure (e.g., blood vessel, portion of gastrointestinal tract, portion of reproductive system, etc.) in a patient. For instance, one tissue layer may comprise the top portion of a blood vessel while the other tissue layer may comprise the bottom portion of the blood vessel, along the same region of length of the blood vessel (e.g., such that the fluid path through the blood vessel before use of electrosurgical instrument (159) is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis defined by end effector (180), etc.). In other words, the lengths of jaws (182, 184) may be oriented perpendicular to (or at least generally transverse to) the length of the blood vessel. As noted above, flanges (162, 166) cammingly act to pivot jaw (182) toward jaw (184) when firing beam (195) is actuated distally by squeezing trigger (164) toward pistol grip (162).</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">With tissue layers captured between jaws (182, 184) firing beam (195) continues to advance distally by the user squeezing trigger (164) toward pistol grip (162). As firing beam (195) advances distally, distal blade (197) simultaneously severs the clamped tissue layers, resulting in separated upper layer portions being apposed with respective separated lower layer portions. In some versions, this results in a blood vessel being cut in a direction that is generally transverse to the length of the blood vessel. It should be understood that the presence of upper flange (162) and the lower flange (not shown) immediately above and below jaws (182, 184), respectively, may help keep jaws (182, 184) in a closed and tightly clamping position. In particular, flanges (162, 166) may help maintain a significantly compressive force between jaws (182, 184). With severed tissue layer portions being compressed between jaws (182, 184), electrode surfaces (190, 192) are activated with bipolar RF energy by the user depressing activation button (166). In some versions, electrodes (190, 192) are selectively coupled with power source (198) (e.g., by the user depressing button (166), etc.) such that electrode surfaces (190, 192) of jaws (182, 184) are activated with a common first polarity while firing beam (195) is activated at a second polarity that is opposite to the first polarity. Thus, a bipolar RF current flows between firing beam (195) and electrode surfaces (190, 192) of jaws (182, 184), through the compressed regions of severed tissue layer portions. In some other versions, electrode surface (190) has one polarity while electrode surface (192) and firing beam (195) both have the other polarity. In either version (among at least some others),<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> bipolar RF energy delivered by power source (198) ultimately thermally welds the tissue layer portions on one side of firing beam (195) together and the tissue layer portions on the other side of firing beam (195) together.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In certain circumstances, the heat generated by activated electrode surfaces (190, 192) can denature the collagen within the tissue layer portions and, in cooperation with clamping pressure provided by jaws (182, 184), the denatured collagen can form a seal within the tissue layer portions. Thus, the severed ends of the natural lumen defining anatomical structure are hemostatically sealed shut, such that the severed ends will not leak bodily fluids. In some versions, electrode surfaces (190, 192) may be activated with bipolar RF energy before firing beam (195) even begins to translate distally and thus before the tissue is even severed. For instance, such timing may be provided in versions where button (166) serves as a mechanical lockout relative to trigger (164) in addition to serving as a switch between power source (198) and electrode surfaces (190, 192).</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">While several of the teachings below are described as variations of instruments (10, 50, 101, 159), it should be understood that various teachings below may also be incorporated into various other types of devices. By way of example only, in addition to being readily incorporated into instruments (10, 50, 101, 159), various teachings below may be readily incorporated into the devices taught in any of the references cited herein, surgical staplers, surgical clip appliers, and tissue graspers, among various other devices. Other suitable devices into which the following teachings may be incorporated will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Of course end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180) and surgical instruments (10, 50, 101, 159) may also include other configurations as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p>
<heading id="h0011">IV. Exemplary Coupling Mechanisms for Modular Shafts and End Effectors</heading>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In some instances it may be useful to change between various shaft lengths and/or types of end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180) while using the same handle assembly (60, 120, 160). For instance, in some procedures, a large amount of tissue may need to be cut, requiring different length end effectors (80, 150, 180) and/or shafts for transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> assemblies (70, 102, 170). Such interchangeable shafts and/or end effectors (80, 150, 180) may permit a common handle assembly (60, 120, 160) to be used for various surgical procedures (e.g., short shafts for open surgery, long shafts for minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, etc.). Moreover, changing out the shafts and/or the end effectors (80, 150, 180) while reusing the same handle assembly (60, 120, 160) may be more time and/or cost effective than using a new surgical instrument (50, 101, 159) with the different length shaft. By way of example only, such shafts and/or end effectors (80, 150, 180) may include color codes to distinguish the various lengths and/or types. In another instance, the handle assembly (60, 120, 160) may be configured to employ different types of end effectors, for instance, the handle assembly (60, 120, 160) may include components to operate an ultrasonic end effector (80, 150) and/or an RF end effector (180). Thus, changing the shafts and end effectors (80, 150, 180) with a common handle assembly (60, 120, 160) may conserve time and/or costs. That is, the body may be operable to communicate with different kinds of end effector assemblies, including those having different dimensions or configurations; those adapted to deliver different kinds of energy (such as RF or ultrasonic); or those being of any other kind; as discussed herein. Accordingly, various coupling mechanisms for coupling the modular shafts to the handle assemblies (60, 120, 160) are described below. It should be understood that in versions where an ultrasonic end effector (80) is used, at least part of transducer (100) may be integral with the shaft and end effector (80), and may thus be selectively coupled with handle assembly (60). Alternatively, transducer (100) may be integral with handle assembly (60) such that the shaft and end effector (80) are selectively coupled with transducer (100) when the shaft and end effector (80) are selectively coupled with handle assembly (60).</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">An exemplary coupling mechanism (200) comprises a threaded slip nut (230) disposed about a shaft (220) of an exemplary end effector assembly (210), shown in <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>. In the present example, end effector assembly (210) comprises a transmission assembly (212), a rotation knob (214), and a shaft (220) extending proximally relative to rotation knob (214). It should be understood that rotation knob (214) is merely optional and may be omitted. Rotation knob (214) is operable to rotate transmission assembly (212) relative to a handle assembly (240) and/or shaft (220). An<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> end effector (not shown) is coupled to a distal end of transmission assembly (212). The end effector may include an ultrasonic end effector (80, 150), an RF end effector (180), and/or any other end effector or combination of end effectors as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Transmission assembly (212) is operable to communicate energy (e.g., ultrasonic vibrations, RF energy, and/or mechanical motion/force, etc.) from a source proximal to transmission assembly (212) to an end effector at the distal end of transmission assembly (212). In the instance of an ultrasonic end effector, such as end effector (80), an axial bore (not shown) through shaft (220) may permit mechanical coupling of transmission assembly (212) through shaft (220) to components within handle assembly (240), which may be configured in a similar manner to multi-piece handle assembly (60) described above. In the case of an RF end effector, such as end effector (180), the axial bore may permit a portion of transmission assembly (212) to extend at least partially through shaft (220). Transmission assembly (212) may include an inner slip ring connector that is electrically coupleable to a complementary slip ring connector on the interior of shaft (220) such that an electrical coupling from handle assembly (240) may be made to the end effector. In yet another alternative, a fluid coupling may also be made via the bore through shaft (220) and/or elsewhere on end effector assembly (210).</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In the present example, a threaded slip nut (230) is slidably disposed about shaft (220). Threaded slip nut (230) includes a keyway (232) (shown in phantom) at a proximal end of threaded slip nut (230). It should be understood that keyway (232) may alternatively be located on a distal end of threaded slip nut (230). Keyway (232) of the present example only partially extends through threaded slip nut (230), though keyway (232) may alternatively extend completely through threaded slip nut (230). As shown in <figref idref="f0009 f0010">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>, keyway (232) is configured to receive a keyed portion (222) of shaft (220). In the present example, keyed portion (222) of shaft (220) is located near a proximal end of shaft (220) and extends outwardly from shaft (220), though it should be understood that keyed portion (222) may alternatively be located distally near rotation knob (214) or at a midpoint of shaft (220). In one merely alternative example, keyed portion (222) may be slidable relative to shaft (220), such as by actuation of a slider to slide keyed portion (222) into keyway (232). Shaft (220) further comprises a proximal flange (224) located<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> on the proximal end of shaft (220) and sized to prevent threaded slip nut (230) from sliding proximally off of shaft (220). As will be described below, keyed portion (222) is insertable into keyway (232) when a user desires to thread threaded slip nut (230) into internal threading (250) of handle assembly (240). Threaded slip nut (230) of the present example may then be slid distally on shaft (220) to disengage keyed portion (222) from keyway (232), thereby permitting shaft (220), rotation knob (214), and/or transmission assembly (212) to rotate freely relative to threaded slip nut (230) and/or handle assembly (240).</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In some instance threaded slip nut (230) may be slidably disposed on an inner tube, such as an inner tubular actuating member described above.

No. 2011/0015660</text></patcit>, entitled "Rotating Transducer Mount for Ultrasonic Surgical Instruments," published January 20, 2011, or of <patcit id="pcit0078" dnum="US6500176B"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,176</text></patcit>, entitled "Electrosurgical Systems and Techniques for Sealing Tissue," issued December 31, 2002, and/or in any other suitable fashion. In the present example, handle assembly (240) includes a member (248) having internal threading (250) disposed about a member aperture (252). Internal threading (250) and threaded slip nut (230) are configured to thread together to secure end effector assembly (210) to handle assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> (240).</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">As shown in the sequence of <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>, threaded slip nut (230) of the present example is slid proximally such that keyed portion (222) of shaft (220) engages keyway (232) of threaded slip nut (230). With the rotational freedom of threaded slip nut (230) restricted by the engagement of keyed portion (222) and keyway (232), a user then threads threaded slip nut (230) into internal threading (250) of handle assembly (240). For instance, an L-shaped spacer tool may be used to urge threaded slip nut (230) proximally on shaft (220) against flange (224) while the user threads threaded slip nut (230) into internal threading (250). Alternatively, a user may manually urge threaded slip nut (230) proximally. Further still, a slider, as noted above, may engage a portion of threaded slip nut (230) to urge threaded slip nut (230) proximally. Of course, still other methods of urging threaded slip nut (230) proximally to engage keyed portion (222) and keyway (232) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. For instance, a spring (not shown) may be disposed about shaft (220) distally of slip nut (230) and proximally of rotation knob (214), thereby biasing slip nut (230) proximally such that keyway (232) is engaged with keyed portion (222). When the user desires to rotate end effector assembly (210), the user grasps rotation knob (214) and pushes end effector assembly (210) proximally until keyed portion (222) disengages from keyway (232).</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Once threaded slip nut (230) has been sufficiently threaded into internal threading (250) (for instance, a torque limiting tool may be used), end effector assembly (210) is slid proximally to disengage keyed portion (222) from keyway (232). End effector assembly (210) may be manually slid distally or, in one alternative, a spring (not shown) located between flange (224) and threaded slip nut (230) may urge end effector assembly (210) distally. In the instance of an ultrasonic instrument, shaft (220) of end effector assembly (210) may be threaded onto a horn of a transducer, such as transducer (100) described above. Such threading may occur prior to, contemporaneously with, or after the threading of threaded slip nut (230) into internal threading (250). Alternatively, in the instance of an RF instrument, shaft (220) may be coupled to one or more electrical connectors (not shown) to couple the end effector to a power source. As shown in <figref idref="f0007">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> 6B</figref>, end effector assembly (210) is effectively longitudinally secured to handle assembly (240) while permitting rotational movement of shaft (220), rotation knob (214), and/or transmission assembly (212). A user may then use the assembled surgical instrument for a procedure. When the user desires to decouple end effector assembly (210) from handle assembly (240), the user pulls end effector assembly (210) distally until keyed portion (222) of shaft (220) engages keyway (232) of threaded slip nut (230). Alternatively, the L-shaped spacer tool may be wedged between threaded slip nut (230) and rotation knob (214) to urge threaded slip nut (230) proximally. With keyed portion (222) and keyway (232) engaged, the user may then unscrew threaded slip nut (230) from internal threading (250), thereby decoupling end effector assembly (210) from handle assembly (240). A user may then couple a new end effector assembly (210) to handle assembly (240).</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">Of course other configurations for coupling mechanism (200) will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. For instance, threaded slip nut (230) may be located between flange (224) and another annular flange (not shown) of shaft (220). In this example, keyed portion (222) may be actuated radially outward from an initial position within a recess (not shown) of shaft (220) to a position where keyed portion (222) engages keyway (232) of threaded slip nut (230). For instance, keyed portion (222) may be actuated by a cam member coupled to a slider located on transmission assembly (212) and/or rotation knob (214). As will become apparent from the previous and later disclosures herein, various other electrical and/or mechanical coupling mechanisms and/or features may be used to substitute coupling mechanism (200), to modify coupling mechanism (200), or to combine with coupling mechanism (200).</p>

<p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idref="f0008">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic view of an information transmission system (300) using device (10) to transmit information. It should be understood that various kinds of devices or instruments (10, 24, 101, 159) may be used in system (300) alongside removable end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180), respective transmission assemblies (70, 102, 170), and reusable handle assemblies (60, 120, 160) where it may be useful to change between<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> various shaft lengths and/or types, as described above. Device (10) is shown as connected to generator (28), as described above, though generator (28) may be incorporated into device (10) or omitted in some versions. Sensor (20) in device (10), which may be included in any of instruments (24, 101, 159), may gather information regarding use of device (10) during a surgical procedure on a patient. Such information may be transmitted to generator (28), which then transmits the information via a secure gateway (302) to a secure server (304). Gateway (302) of the present example includes Secure Web Gateway (SWG) technology combining features such as anti-malware, URL filtering, web content filtering, bandwidth management, application control, and/or caching capabilities in order to secure, monitor, and control traffic between generator (28) and server (304), regardless of whether such traffic is encrypted or not. Server (304), which may be a secure server outside a hospital network, communicates the information via a secure web interface (306) to a unique patient file (308). Patient file (308) includes patient history specific to the first patient on whom device (10) was used during the surgical procedure from which information was collected and transmitted. The particular device (10) and components used on the first patient may be, for example, tracked and entered into patient file (308) via the system shown in <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 7</figref>. Information may be shared to patient file (308) directly after use of device (10) in the associated surgical procedure performed on the first patient. To the extent that a hospital desires to track patient care throughout an entire experience associated with a patient, including but not limited information such as the types of tools, services, and materials that were used on or for a patient during that patient's hospital experience, system (300) assists with this goal by providing desired information regarding device (10) used with a patient during a particular surgical procedure. By tracking information such as amount of time a device such as device (10) and its attached and/or removable components were used on a patient along with electrical characteristics associated with such use, and the types of device and/or device components used, a cost may be calculated based on the tracked information. Further, by tracking such information and data monitoring, analysis and recommendations for future surgical improvements may be obtained from the tracked procedure data to improve outcomes of and to build best practices for similar future surgeries. Hospitals using system (300) may control what type of data tracked during use<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> of device (10) is associated with a specific patient that device (10) was used upon during a surgical procedure, and thus which data is viewable in patient file (308). System (300) transmits information via a secure process as described below.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idref="f0009 f0010">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> show an exemplary process that may be carried out using system (300). Unique serial numbers may be associated with particular types of instruments (10, 24, 101, 159) and/or medical device components, such as removable end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180), and respective transmission assemblies (70, 102, 170), and handle assemblies (60, 120, 160). Each unique serial number of device (10), for example, and components associated with device (10), is received (500) by generator (28). For example, such data may be transmitted to and received by generator (28) via a wired or wireless connection, may be manually inputted into a user interface in communication with generator (28), and/or may be automatically registered by generator (28) via a receiver in communication with generator (28). For ease of reference, regarding use with system (300), when device (10) is referenced alongside its components, it is understood that any of devices or instruments (10, 24, 101, 159) alongside respective removable end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180), and respective transmission assemblies (70, 102, 170), and respective handle assemblies (60, 120, 160) may be used in place of device (10) and its components. Additionally or alternatively, generator (28) may be removed from system (300) and information from sensor (20) of device (10), or other instruments such as instrument (159), for example, may be transmitted wirelessly and/or via a wired communication to secure gateway (302).</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Information such as the type of device (10) and type of end effector (16) used, or that of any of the instruments, end effectors, transmission assemblies, and/or handle assemblies within the present disclosure, and the amount of time such components were used during a surgical procedure on a patient are transmitted via system (300) to server (304). System (300) may also transmit information indicating the type of surgical procedure to server (304). Other suitable types of information that may be transmitted to server (304) will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. As shown in <figref idref="f0009 f0010">FIG. 8</figref>, unique serial numbers of medical device components used or to be used in a surgical procedure, are received (500) in generator (28). A security or<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> secure key is or has been coded (502) into secure gateway (302). The medical device components are then used on a first patient during a surgical procedure. Data is captured (504) in device (10), for example, during the surgical procedure on the first patient via sensor (20) in device (10). As described above, such data may include a sensed temperature at end effector (16), a determined oscillation rate of end effector (16), the impedance of tissue encountered by end effector (16) and/or other properties of such tissue, motions of end effector (16) during a surgical procedure (e.g., when sensor (20) includes an accelerometer), and/or other data as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Information including the captured data and the unique serial numbers associated with the used device (10) and end effector (16), for example, is transmitted (506) to generator (28). Generator (28) may be connected via, for example, a USB port, ethernet, or other wired or wireless connection to secure gateway (302) in a one-way or two-way connection. The gathered information is thereby uploaded (508) to secure gateway (302) via generator (28). It should be understood that any step within steps (500-508) may be performed at any suitable time. For instance, step (508) may be carried out through a continuous data stream throughout the surgical procedure. Alternatively, step (508) may be carried out after the procedure is complete. Other time frames and relationships will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="f0010">FIG. 8B</figref>, after the surgical procedure is compete, a call is initiated (510) to secure server (304) to request the previously coded secure key. Server (304) replies (512) to the call request with the previously coded secure key. The secure key is validated (514) via secure gateway (302) after being received. Upon successful completion of the secure key validation, an upload of information to secure server (304) is initiated (516) via secure gateway (302). The uploaded information is transmitted (518) via secure server (304) to patient file (308) associated with the first patient that underwent the surgical procedure using device (10) and end effector (16). In some instances a cost is determined (520) based on the transmitted, uploaded information in patient file (308), amount of time used and data regarding use of device (10) and end effector (16), and other device components, and/or other information. For instance, a dollar amount may be associated with minutes of use for device (10), for an amount of<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> voltage used via a connection between generator (28) and device (10) for application on tissue of the first patient during the surgical procedure, total energy used by device (10), total current used by device (10), number of activations of device (10), and/or various other parameters, including various combinations of parameters. The retrieved information may be tallied and a pre-set calculation may be applied to the retrieved information to generate an overall cost of use associated with device (10) during the surgical procedure on the first patient. The tallied cost may be stored in patient file (308) and displayed on, for example, a computer monitor or other user information or printed on one or more reports generated from patient file (308). A hospital may track costs associated across various patients with devices and/or components having certain serial numbers to analyze results and view which types of devices and/or components may be more costly than others or might be desirably used in certain types of surgeries in a cost-effective and time-effective manner.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">The tallied cost may also be submitted to an outside server (304) as an invoice that the hospital might pay to one or more vendors or manufacturers of device (10), end effector (16), and/or other components of device (10). Server (304) also may play the function of notifying a hospital information technology system that new data has been logged into a patient file (308) along with information regarding the time of receipt of the logged information and other suitable information as apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Of course, the instrument usage data need not necessarily be used for establishing usage costs or controls. For instance, usage data may be used as a measure of surgical time, surgeon/operator performance, efficiency, effectiveness, etc. Other suitable ways in which instrument usage data might be used will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p>

Sensor (20) in an example may track a technique that a surgeon uses on device (10) during the procedure. Feedback from sensor (20), for example, may be<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> transmitted via a wired or wireless connection to a receiving device such as server (304) or other suitable device, such as a computer or smartphone. Software programs can then be used to analyze the transmitted data for use by the surgeon, the Operation Room ("OR") staff, biomedical researchers, or others, such as in a manner as described in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0079" dnum="US276725" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Patent App. No. 13/276,725</text></patcit>.</p>

It should be understood that device (10) may include more than one type of integral sensor (20). Sensor (20) may be operable in accordance with the teachings of <patcit id="pcit0080" dnum="US276660" dnum-type="L"><text>U.S. Pat. App. No. 13/276,660</text></patcit>. For example, a pressure sensor may be built into trigger (18) of device (10). The pressure sensor may comprise an electronic pressure sensor, or pressure transducer, converting pressure into an analog electrical signal. Such pressure transducers may utilize force collectors such as a diaphragm to measure strain or deflection due to an applied force over a space. Force collector types may include but not be limited to a piezoresistive strain gauge, capacitive strain gauge, electromagnetic strain gauge, piezoelectric strain gauge, and/or optical strain gauge. Various suitable forms that such gauges may take will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Similarly, various suitable ways in which such strain gauges may be incorporated into trigger (18) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Sensor (20) may be disposed in any of instruments (10, 24, 101, 159) and in various locations within instruments (10, 24, 101, 159), such as in removable end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180), and/or respective transmission assemblies (70, 102, 170), and/or handle assemblies (60, 120, 160). Removable end effectors (16, 80, 150, 180), and/or respective transmission assemblies (70, 102, 170), attachable to handle assemblies (60, 120, 160) are referable to as "Apps" in the present disclosure.

For instance, sensor (20) may be operable to measure the acoustic impedance of device (10). In addition or in the alternative, sensor (20) may be operable to measure electrical impedance of tissue. Furthermore, sensor (20) may comprise a displacement measuring device giving feedback on a position of a clamp arm of end effector (16) (e.g., indicating whether the clamp arm is in an open position, closed position, or somewhere between). Sensor (20) may also comprise one or more thermal sensors disposed within the clamp arm of the end effector to register a clamp arm temperature and/or a tissue temperature. Sensor (20) may also comprise a pressure sensor disposed in the clamp arm of end effector (16) to measure the pressure applied to tissue by the clamp arm and an opposing blade of end effector (16). Sensor (20) may additionally be a combination of two or more of the above-described sensors.

The left side y-value shows units of microns of movement per second, indicating steadiness (530) of device (10); and the right side y-value shows units of pounds of force, indicating blade pressure (534). As shown in <figref idref="f0011">FIG. 9</figref>, over the time device (10) was used in a sample surgical procedure, the surgeon using device (10) used a fairly constant speed (532) with device (10), applied about two cycles of built up and reduced pressure (534) on end effector (16) of device (10) against the operated-upon tissue, and has a steadiness (530) that fairly paralleled the blade pressure (534) applied against the tissue, with steadiness (530) building when pressure (534) built and dropping when pressure (534) dropped.

The left side y-value measures both power (540) measured in Watts (W) and voltage (542) measured in Volts (V), and the right side y-value measures tissue impedance (548) in units of Ohms (Ω). Impedance correlates to an amount of resistance to current in tissue (such that an increased impedance reduces the flow of current). For instance, sensor (20) may be used to sense tissue impedance. The application of trigger (18) of device (10) is shown by line (544) at a first time around 30 seconds into the procedure.

The calibration kit includes various materials that assist to gather data to test a<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> synthetic. The calibration kit includes various materials that assist to gather data to test a surgeon's usage behavior and preferences with a device (10), for example, on the test material before testing the usage on a patient during a surgical procedure. Certain various parameters may be tracked and calibrated, such as a preferred force the surgeon desires to apply, average speeds the surgeon tends to use, and/or other parameters as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. In the present example, generator (28) provides selection between a calibration mode and at least one surgical procedure mode.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067"><figref idref="f0015">FIG. 13A</figref> shows that a calibration mode including such parameters to track, for example, is entered (604) on generator (28). Each of the selected Apps are used (606) with the calibration kit by the surgeon to establish the surgeon's personally calibrated parameter settings. For example, a surgeon uses a selected App on organic pig tissue that may be included in the calibration kit, utilizing the App with device (10) to cut, transect, and seal the pig tissue and internal vessels and retrieve usage data from the test procedure on the pig tissue. For instance, the user may delete data associated with unsuccessful testing on the tissue/model provided in the kit, saving only data associated with successful testing. In addition or in the alternative, generator (28) can automatically adjust its own operating parameters during the calibration process in an attempt to achieve surgical success in the testing despite any abnormal surgical techniques/tendencies displayed by the surgeon. The desired outcome centered on these parameters are obtained (608) via use of the calibration kit as well as a set of associated outcome settings or parameters. The obtained outcome settings (610) are stored in generator (28) and are associated with a user key. The obtained outcome settings (610) may also include data gathered in accordance with other teachings herein (e.g., from sensor (20)). Based on data collected during the calibration procedure shown in <figref idref="f0015">FIG. 13A</figref>, generator (28) is able to establish compensatory operating parameters to compensate for surgeon tendencies. For instance, if the calibration process shows that the surgeon tends to apply an abnormally high amount of force to tissue, generator (28) may know to reduce power to avoid unintended/adverse tissue damage. Other ways in which operating parameters of generator (28) may be adjusted based on surgeon usage idiosyncrasies will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --></p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068"><figref idref="f0016">FIG. 13B</figref> shows steps that may be carried out after generator (28) has been calibrated based on the particular surgeon's unique usage idiosyncrasies. In particular, <figref idref="f0016">FIG. 13B</figref> shows that at least one App is selected (612) for use in a surgical procedure by, for example, the surgeon. The selected App is connected (614) to the generator (28). The user key is entered (616) into a user interface that is in communication with generator (28), such that the calibrated settings are recalled (618) via the entry of the user key. The calibrated settings are transmitted (620) to the selected App, which is used (622) in a surgical procedure.</p>
