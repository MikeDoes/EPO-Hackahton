<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a dental implant being at least partially covered by a protective layer.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Dental implants are used to replace individual teeth or for anchoring more complex structures, which generally replace several or even all teeth. Implants have two essential parts: an anchoring part and an abutment part. The anchoring part is embedded in the bone, where it osseointegrates with the bone tissue to provide a firm anchor for the prosthesis. The abutment extends into the oral cavity and provides a support for the prosthesis. The desired prosthetic element (e.g. bridge or crown) is fastened over the abutment such that at least part of the abutment is housed within the prosthesis and provides core support to this. The prosthetic element can be adhesively bonded, cemented, screwed or directly veneered onto the abutment.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Implants, such as dental implants, are well known in the art. They generally consist of a material, which is biocompatible and which additionally has favorable mechanical properties.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, it is required that the dental implant provides good osseointegration. The term "osseointegration" designates the direct structural and functional connection between living bone and the surface of the load-bearing implant. A good osseointegration means that the implant, after reaching a primary stability by screwing it into the bone, safely ossifies within a short healing time so that a permanent bond between implant and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> bone is obtained.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In the beginning phase of modern implantology a minimally rough surface was the gold standard. Later, an increase to moderately rough surfaces led to faster and firmer osseointegration in several experimental studies using various animal models.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">A breakthrough technology in the development of highly osseointegrative dental implants is the so-called "SLA" process which is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0388576A"><text>EP 0 388 576</text></patcit>, involving sandblasting the implant's surface followed by acid-etching to achieve an optimal topography for the attachment of bone cells.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Based on the "SLA" technology, the so-called "SLActive" surface was developed and disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0044305A"><text>WO 00/44305</text></patcit>, which further comprises conditioning the "SLA" surface either in nitrogen or in an isotonic saline solution, thereby maintaining the high hydrophilicity of the "SLA" surface which would otherwise be lost due to reaction with the atmosphere. The packaging process is time-consuming and expensive, which is a disadvantage of this procedure.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2014172028A"><text>US 2014/172028</text></patcit> discloses a surface treatment process of an endosseous implantable medical device by covering the surface of the medical implant with a sugar or a sugar alcohol.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2008098976A"><text>WO 2008/098976</text></patcit> discloses a process for the production of implants with a hydrophilic surface by covering the surface of said implant with a salty layer.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20090132048A"><text>US 2009/0132048</text></patcit> discloses a dental implant which is at least partly provided with a protective layer which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> dissolves on contact with body fluid and/or the bone, said protective layer consisting of salt. However, salty protective layers, in particular those consisting of NaCl, show a reduced long-term stability.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO03030957A"><text>WO 03/030957</text></patcit> discloses an implant having roughened hydroxylated and hydrophilic surface and being treated in the hydroxylated state with high-energy ultraviolet radiation. One disadvantage of this solution is the additional treatment step which is supposed to be carried out by the surgeon in particular.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP2992908A"><text>EP 2 992 908</text></patcit> discloses a method for treating a surface of an implant made of titanium or a titanium alloy including coating a surface treatment composition containing an organic material having a hydrophilic group on the surface of the implant. The organic material includes at least one selected from the group consisting of saccharides, proteins, acids and biological buffer or good's buffer. Many possible saccharides, in particular glucose, are mentioned. However, many of them are not water-soluble such as cellulose and can therefore not be applied on a hydrophilic surface without destroying a hydrophilic surface of the implant.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US20110053113A"><text>US 2011/0053113</text></patcit> discloses a dental implant made of titanium or a titanium alloy which has a coating. The coating comprises a simvastatin salt. Statins such as simvastatin can promote the formulation of bone in vitro and in vivo. As matrix material, a water-soluble ionic polymeric component, in particular an amino-containing derivative of natural polysaccharides, is used.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Park et al, Biomaterials 33 (2012), 5267-5277</text></nplcit> disclose the use of polyelectrolyte films to modulate osteoblast<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> response to microstructured titanium surfaces. Said films comprise chitosan poly(L-lysine) or poly(L-glutamic acid).</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO2012175220A"><text>WO 2012/175220</text></patcit> relates to a dental implant made of a ceramic material, wherein the surface region of the dental implant is enriched with a magnesium component thereby forming a hydrophilic surface area.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The object of the present invention is to provide an implant which has excellent osseointegration properties after storage.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The problem is solved by the dental implant according to claim 1. Further preferred embodiments are subjects of the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Surprisingly, it was found that the dental implant according to the present invention has an excellent stock stability. After removal of the protective layer, it has still a hydrophilic surface. That is, even though large organic polymers are involved, the hydrophilic surface is maintained and not negatively influenced. This finding was very surprising since a water-soluble dextran having a molecular weight of more than 15'000 Dalton have a much lower hydrophilicity than small organic molecules such as fructose or glucose.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The protective layer prevents the deposition of contaminants, in particular of organic compounds, on the implant surface having at least partly a contact angle of less than 20Â°. In addition, the contact angle on the surface of the protective layer is less than 40Â°, that is, even the protective layer itself has a good wettability. The maintenance of the high hydrophilicity of the surface of the dental implant ensures an excellent wettability<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> inducing an accelerated osseointegration. In particular, it could be shown that the protective layer according to the present invention can withstand harsh conditions such as high humidity, low temperature or low pressure. The protective layer of the dental implant according to the present invention allows to maintain the hydrophilicity of the surface during the storage time in the air.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Depending on the surgeon, the protective layer remains on the implant during the implantation and is dissolved or eliminated by the human body within a short time period or the protective layer is removed immediately before the implantation by washing with water.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The first option has the advantage, that no further chairside treatment is necessary. However, due to the fast elimination of the protective layer within the body, the wettability of the implant will be essentially the same as if the protective layer is removed before the implantation.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The dental implant according to the present invention is made of a ceramic material and comprises an implant surface having at least partially a contact angle of less than 20Â°, said implant surface being at least partially covered by a protective layer. Said protective layer comprises a water-soluble nonionic dextran having a molecular weight of more than 15'000 Da.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Water-soluble dextran within the context of the present invention means that the solubility of the dextran in water at 25Â°C is more than 10 g / liter (that is 1% weight to volume), preferably more than 25 g / liter (that is, 2.5% weight to volume), and most preferably more than 30 g / liter (that is, 3% weight to volume). The water<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> solubility of dextran is essential since dextran has to be solubilized in water in order to prepare the protective layer. An organic solvent such as ethanol immediately would destroy the hydrophilicity of the surface to be protected. The water solubility ensures a fast resorption of the protective layer after a short period of time exposing the hydrophilic surface of the dental implant to the bone tissue. This allows a direct structural and functional connection between the living bone and the dental implant which is a prerequisite of good osseointegration. In addition, the small amount of the water-soluble dextran is absorbed in the body without any negative side effects.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The standard parameter to determine the hydrophilicity of a surface is the measurement of the water contact angle (DIN 55660-2). The contact angle quantifies the wettability of the implant by water and therefore the degree of contact with the hydrophilic surroundings. The term "contact angle" as used in the context of the present invention relates to the contact angle of water on the surface, i.e. to the angle formed at the interface where water meets the surface. Thereby, the term "water" used in the context of the contact angle measurement relates to pure water, specifically ultrapure water. In particular, the contact angle measurement is carried out by the sessile drop method (e.g. by means of a device of the type EasyDrop DSA20E, Kruss GmbH) using a drop size of 0.3 Âµl. Contact angles were calculated by fitting a circular segment function to the contour of the droplet placed on the surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The term "hydrophilic" or "hydrophilicity" as used in the context of the present invention refers to a water contact angle of the hydrophilic surface area directly on the dental implant being less than 20Â°, more preferably less than 10Â°. For a contact angle of less than 10Â°, the term "superhydrophilic" is used.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Such a hydrophilic surface having a contact angle of less than 20Â° can be obtained for example by the so-called SLA technology or by other etching procedures. Contact angles are determined after rinsing (washing) the implants (or the samples) with ultrapure water for about 15 seconds followed by blow drying in a stream of Argon, in order to remove the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Preferred procedures are disclosed below. Preferably, the entire implant surface region which is to come into contact with the bone tissue in the implanted state has a hydrophilic surface, that is a surface having a contact angle of less than 20Â°. However, also the surface region which is to come into contact with the soft tissue may have a hydrophilic surface having a contact angle of less than 20Â°. Alternatively, the surface region which is to come into contact with the soft tissue may be untreated or may have a hydrophilic surface having a contact angle of less than 45Â°. In particular, if said surface region has a smooth, not roughened surface, a contact angle of less than 45Â° may be sufficient for a good wettability as well.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The dental implant according to the present invention can be constructed in one or more parts, in which case they consist of at least an anchoring part, often referred to in isolation as the implant, and an abutment, sometimes referred to as a spacer or post element. The anchoring<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> part is usually either embedded completely in the bone, that is to say to the height of the alveolar crest (so called bone level implants), or protrudes by a few millimetres from the alveolar crest into the soft tissue (so called soft tissue level implants). The abutment is mounted either directly or indirectly to the anchoring part after the latter has become incorporated (osseointegrated) into the bone, or directly after the anchoring part has been inserted. It can also be attached to the anchoring part prior to insertion.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Preferably, such an anchoring part of a multi-part dental implant is generally in a cylindrical or conical shape, having an apical end with a body portion and a coronal end with a neck portion intended to receive an abutment in case of multi-part implants, and a transition portion being arranged in axial direction between the body portion and the neck portion. On said abutment a crown, a bridge or another suprastructure may be fixed, for example by screwing, cementing or gluing. The body portion is intended to be directed against the bone tissue in the implanted state and the neck portion is intended to direct against the soft tissue, whereas the transition portion may direct against the bone tissue or the soft tissue depending on the patient.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, the total length of the anchoring part is 4 to 19 mm in the axial direction. The body portion with the apical end is preferably 50 to 90% of the total length of the implant in axial direction. The neck portion with the coronal end which is essentially be intended to be in contact with the soft tissue covers preferably 10 to 40% of the total length of the implant in axial direction. The transition portion covers preferably 0 to 40% of the total<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> length of the implant in axial direction. The neck portion has preferably a length of 1 to 4 mm, most preferably 1.8 to 2.8 mm, the transition portion has preferably a length of 0 to 2 mm, most preferably 1 to 2 mm, and the body portion has preferably a length of 4 to 18 mm.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The body portion typically includes a threaded part which may by self-tapping or non-self-tapping. In order to obtain an excellent osseointegration, the body portion is typically provided with a surface roughness. The term "surface roughness" within the context of the present invention stands for "arithmetical mean height" (S<sub>a</sub>). Details with regard to the determination of the surface roughness are disclosed below. Preferably, the surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> of the body portion in the range from 0.1Âµm to 2.0Âµm, preferably being in a range from 0.4 Âµm to 1.8 Âµm.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The transition portion may be provided with the same surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> as the body portion. However, it may have a slightly lower surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> than the body portion, preferably in the range from 0.05Âµm to 1.5Âµm, most preferably 0.1Âµm to 1.0Âµm. Such a transition portion is sufficiently rough to minimize the danger of bone resorption.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The neck portion typically includes an unthreaded part, which is in coronal direction outwardly tapering or is substantially straight and ends in a shoulder portion which may have an inwardly-tapering surface. The neck part may be smooth, that is machined, or it may be provided with a surface roughness S<sub>a</sub>. However, preferably the surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> of the neck portion is less than the surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> of the body portion. Preferably the surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> of the neck portion is in the range of 0.01 Âµm to 1.0 Âµm, most preferably in the range of 0.05 Âµm<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to 0.5 Âµm, since this positively influences the osseointegration of the implant, while minimizing the adherence of dental plaque that can cause an adverse mucosal tissue reaction and result in a loss of crestal bone.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Roughness images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Âµsurf explorer, NanoFocus AG, Oberhausen, Germany) equipped with a 20x lens.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The roughness parameters were calculated using the WinSAM software. The whole roughness image with a size of 798 Âµm (micrometer) x 798 Âµm (micrometer), later resolution 1.56 Âµm (micrometer), piezoelectric scanner, step size 0.07 Âµm (micrometer) was used for the calculation of the 3D roughness parameters (working distance 3.1 mm, n.a. 0.45).</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The values of the microscopic topographical formation (roughness) were determined using a moving average Gaussian filter with a cut-off wavelength of 30 Âµm (x = 31 Âµm, y = 30 Âµm, 20 x 19 image points). Then, the roughness values were calculated by means of a KFL analysis with limits from the amplitude density, step size 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">Specifically, the surface roughness S<sub>a</sub> (the arithmetic mean deviation of the surface in three dimensions) was determined in analogy to EN ISO 4287 relating to the respective parameters R<sub>a</sub> in two dimensions. For the parameters in three dimensions, it is further referred to ISO 25178 (Sa is defined as Sq).</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In case of a bone level implant, the anchoring part consists of the body portion and has no neck portion, since the whole implant is intended to be directed against the bone tissue.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The surface of the body portion has at least partially a contact angle of less than 20Â°. Preferably, the entire surface of the body portion has a contact angle of less than 20Â°. Said surface is at least partially, preferably essentially entirely covered with the protective layer according to the present invention. The expression "essentially entirely" means within the context of the present invention at least 95% of the surface of the body portion having a contact angle of less than 20Â° is covered by the protective layer.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In a further embodiment of the present invention not only the body portion but also the transition portion of the anchoring part is hydrophilic. Preferably the transition portion has a contact angle of less than 45Â°, preferably of less than 20Â°, which is covered by the protective layer. Preferably, at least 25%, most preferably at least 50% of the apical circumferential surface area of the transition portion is covered with said protective layer. This allows more flexibility when implanting the implant and ensures that the whole surface, which is intended to be in contact with the bone tissue, is hydrophilic.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Alternatively, except for the shoulder portion, that is the inwardly-tapering surface of the neck portion, the entire surface of anchoring part, including body portion, transition portion and neck portion, is hydrophilic, since it could be shown that a hydrophilic surface leads to the formation of new connective tissue adjacent to the soft tissue contact surface of the implant and the new connective tissue tends to be in close contact with said surface. The contact angle of the neck part and the transition part may be higher than the contact angle of the body part. The contact angle of the neck part and of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the transition part may be for example less than 45Â° and the contact angle of the body part may be less than 20Â°. Most preferably, except for the shoulder portion, the entire surface of the anchoring part has a contact angle of less than 20Â° which is completely covered with the protective layer according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">Alternatively, the dental implant according to the present invention can be constructed in one part, such that the anchoring part and the abutment part are produced as one integral monolithic piece. Hence in such implant systems, the integrated anchoring part and the abutment are always positioned within the mouth at the same time and the single piece implant, which is also called monotype implant, extends through the soft tissue into the oral cavity to form a core support for the prosthesis. Such monotype implants do not require a separate, secondary part.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">Similar to the multi-part implant system the anchoring portion of such a monotype implant is generally in a cylindrical or conical shape, having an apical end with a body portion and a coronal end with a neck portion passing into the abutment. The anchoring portion is typically provided with a threaded part, which may be self-tapping or non-self-tapping. A transition portion is arranged in axial direction between the body portion and the neck portion. On the abutment portion a crown, a bridge or another suprastructure may be fixed, for example by screwing, cementing or gluing. The body portion is intended to be directed against the bone tissue in the implanted state and the neck portion is intended to direct against the soft tissue, whereas the transition portion<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> may direct against the bone tissue or the soft tissue depending on the patient.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">The surface of said body portion of the monotype implant has at least partially a contact angle of less than 20Â°. Preferably, the entire surface of the body portion has a contact angle of less than 20Â°. Said surface is at least partially, preferably entirely covered with the protective layer according to the present invention. Further, as for the multi-part implant systems also the surface transition portion and / or the surface of the neck portion have contact angle of less than 45Â°, preferably of less than 20Â°, which is covered by the protective layer. Preferably, at least 25%, most preferably at least 50% of the apical circumferential surface area of the transition portion is covered with said protective layer.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">However, preferably the abutment portion of such a monotype dental implant is free of a protective layer, since this could negatively impair the fixation of the suprastructure.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">A protective coating is not generally necessary for abutments, crowns, bridges or other prosthetic constructions.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">The protective layer covering at least partly, preferably fully the hydrophilic surface of the dental implant according to the present invention is preferably a continuous, crackless layer. In particular, if not only the body portion, but also the transition portion or the transition portion and the neck portion are covered with the protective layer, said protective layer is preferably one continuous layer.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">The dextran comprised in the protective layer is a water-soluble<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> nonionic dextran. Charged dextran derivatives such as diethylaminoethyl cellulose dextran or carboxymethyldextran are not encompassed by the term "nonionic dextran".</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">It could be shown that a nonionic dextran can protect the hydrophilic surface of the dental implant. Very good effects could be obtained with a dextran having a molecular weight of 35'000 to 50'000 Da. With dextran having a molecular weight of 35'000 to 50'000 Da, preferably of about 40'000 Da, essentially closed and stable layers could be formed. The absence of cracks, that is essentially closed and stable layers, is very important since this ensures that no small organic particles can come in contact with the implant surface having a contact angle of less than 20Â° and therefore allows to maintain the hydrophilicity of said surface.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The protective layer is preferably free of other organic molecules, and in particular free of water-insoluble organic molecules in order to avoid the presence of ethanol in the preparation process.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">Preferably, the protective layer additionally comprises at least one salt or a mixture of different salts. It was found that the combination of a water-soluble nonionic dextran having a molecular weight of more than 15'000 Da and a salt results in a closed and stable protective layer. In contrast thereto, protective layers consisting exclusively of NaCl or KCl form cracks and pattern after drying, which is of course less preferred, in particular with regard to the long-term stability.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Especially good results could be obtained by the combination of a water-soluble nonionic dextran having a molecular<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> weight of more than 15'000 Da and a divalent salt. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that remaining crystal water of the divalent salts could help to form a close, crackless protective layer.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Preferably, the salt is selected from the group consisting of NaCl, KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, SrCl<sub>2</sub>, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or a mixture thereof, most preferably of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and SrCl<sub>2</sub>, and in particular of SrCl<sub>2</sub>. Best results could be obtained by a combination of dextran having a molecular weight of 35'000 to 50'000 Da and MgCl<sub>2</sub> or SrCl<sub>2</sub>, and in particular in combination with SrCl<sub>2</sub>. Said combinations result in protective layers having an outstanding long-term stability.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">The protective layer has typically a thickness in the range of 0.1 to 20 Âµm, preferably 0.2 to 5 Âµm, including 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 and 4.5 Âµm. In principle, it is sufficient for the layer to cover the hydrophilic surface of the dental implant so that no deposits form thereon. Even a protective layer which is just a few layers of atoms in thickness stops organic compounds depositing directly on the hydrophilic surface. Although the organic compounds are then able to deposit on the protective layer, the surface remains altogether hydrophilic and biologically active.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The speed with which the protective coating dissolved in the body can be controlled by the choice of the thickness of the layer and the water solubility of the protective coating. In particular, the dissolution of a protective layer having a thickness of 0.2 to 5 Âµm is very fast, allowing an almost immediate contact, that is within a few<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> seconds, of the hydrophilic surface of the implant with the blood.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Preferably, in the protective layer, the molar ratio of dextran to salt is between 1:1 and 1:10, preferably between 1:1 and 1:5 and most preferably between 1:1 and 1:2. It has to be noted that due to the high molecular weight of dextran in comparison with a salt, the weights of dextran dominate in such a protective layer, even if the molar ratio of dextran to salt is 1:10.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">In one embodiment of the present invention, the dental implant made of a ceramic material is made of zirconia, preferably of a yttria stabilized zirconia. Most preferably the yttria stabilized zirconia comprises further stabilizators. The composition of the partially stabilized zirconia complies with the requirement that the total amount of ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and HfO<sub>2</sub> is more than 99.0 weight-%, with the amount of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> being from 4.5 to 5.4 weight-%, with the amount of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> being less than 0.5 weight-% and the amount of HfO<sub>2</sub> being less than 5.0 weight-%. Even more preferably the dental implant is made of a mixture of 92.1%-93.5% by weight ZrO2%, 4.5%-5.5 % by weight Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and 1.8%-2.2% by weight of HfO<sub>2</sub>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the ceramic implant is made of yttria stabilized zirconia according to ISO 13356.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">An example of a preferred yttria-stabilized zirconia is Tosoh zirconia powder of grade TZ-3YSB-E (Tosoh Corporation) comprising 4.95 to 5.35 weight-% of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0.15 to 0.35 weight-% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, at most 0.02 weight-% SiO<sub>2</sub>, at most 0.01 weight-% Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, at most 0.02 weight-% SiO<sub>2</sub>, at most 0.01 weight-% Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, at most 0.04 weight-% Na<sub>2</sub>O and comprising a binder in an amount corresponding to an lg-loss<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> of 2.7 to 3.9 weight-%, the percentages being based on the total weight of the zirconia powder.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">Such ceramic materials show no interaction with other dental material. In addition, they have a light colour and can thus be closely adapted to natural tooth colour. Also, such a ceramic implant is highly resistant, biocompatible and can be worked into the desired shape for a dental implant or abutment.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Preferably, the dental implant according to the present invention has a storage stability of more than 4 months, preferably 6 months, most preferably 24 months. Such a high storage stability can be reached in particular with a protective layer comprising dextran and a divalent salt.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">A further aspect of the invention provides a package comprising the implant according to the present invention. The implant is kept within the package. The protective layer works as a preserving layer for preventing deposits on the surface of the implant. Therefore, there is no need to make the package gas- and/or liquid tight and, in contrast to the state of the art, to provide an inert atmosphere in the package. In consequence, the manufacturing process is less costly and more convenient.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">Preferably, the dental implant is sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. This technique can be applied on the dental implant that is packed already. The ethylene oxide gas permeates the packaging and reaches the dental article to be sterilized. It could be shown that a sterilization by ethylene oxide gas does not negatively influence the stability of the protective layer. The hydrophilicity of the surface remains stable, which is particularly relevant<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> when the dental implant is stored over relative long periods.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">The present invention also relates to a package comprising a sterilized dental implant according to the present invention. Preferably, the sterilization is carried out by ethylene oxide gas.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for treating a dental implant made of a ceramic material as follows:
<ol id="ol0001" ol-style="">
<li>a) treating at least partially the surface of a dental implant to obtain a contact angle of less than 20Â°,</li>
<li>b) covering at least partially the surface of the implant having a contact angle of less than 20Â° with an aqueous solution comprising at least water-soluble nonionic dextran having a molecular weight of more than 15'000 Da,</li>
<li>c) drying said surface by removing at least partly the water to obtain a protective layer.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">To obtain a hydrophilicity of less than 20Â°, preferably of less than 10Â°, at least part of the dental implant may be treated according to the process described for example in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="EP0388576A"><text>EP 0 388 576</text></patcit> leading to an SLAÂ® surface topography.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">The expression "removing at least partly the water" within the context of the present invention stands for removing the water to such an extent that a solid, stable layer is formed. However, crystal water, in particular, if divalent salts are present, may remain in the protective layer.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">In particular, the dental implant is preferably prepared by a process comprising the steps of
<ol id="ol0002" ol-style="">
<li>1) providing an implant made of a ceramic material,</li>
<li>2) roughening at least a part of the surface of the implant mechanically and/or by using plasma technology and/or by laser structuring or by other methods known to the skilled person,</li>
<li>3) etching the roughened surface with an acid,</li>
<li>4) optionally plasma cleaning of the dental implant. Preferably, the roughening of step 2) is carried out by shot-blasting and/or sand-blasting.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The etching of step 3) is preferably carried out by an inorganic acid or a blend of inorganic acids. More preferably, the inorganic acid(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">If the implant is made of zirconia, a preferred surface topography can be obtained for example by applying the process described in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP1982670A"><text>EP 1 982 670</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="EP1982671A"><text>EP 1 982 671</text></patcit> before coating the roughened and etched surface.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">Preferably, the dental implant according to the present invention is prepared by a process comprising the steps of
<ol id="ol0003" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1) providing an implant made of ceramic, preferably made of yttria stabilized zirconia,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></li>
<li>2) roughening at least a part of the surface of the implant mechanically and/or by using plasma technology and/or by laser structuring,</li>
<li>3) etching the roughened surface with an acid,</li>
<li>4) optionally plasma cleaning of the dental implant. Preferably, the roughening of step 2) is carried out by shot-blasting and/or sand-blasting. Such procedures are known to those skilled in the art.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">With regard to the sandblasting different known methods may be used, for example injection blasting or pressure blasting. The parameter used depend on the method are known to the skilled person. A considerably improved macroscopic roughness is achieved when using a hard material, such as boron carbide. In a further preferred embodiment, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles having an average diameter of 0.1-0.6mm, 0.15-0.5 mm, 0.2-0.4 mm in case of metal implants and 0.05-0.5 mm, 0.1-0.4 mm, 0.12-0.36 mm in case of ceramic implants.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">As an alternative to sandblasting, the macroscopic roughness can also be provided by injection molding techniques. Injection molding techniques are known to a skilled person and are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US20040029075A"><text>US 2004/0029075</text></patcit>. According to these techniques, casting molds with cavities are used, said cavities corresponding to the peaks of the macroscopic roughness of the molded implant. The cavities of the casting mold are slightly greater in proportion than the peaks to be provided, taking into account the shrinking of the ceramic after injection molding. The casting molds themselves may be treated by<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> sand blasting, anodization, laser and/or by erosion techniques in order to produce the cavities or the structured surface on the inner surface of the molds.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">Injection molding techniques have the advantage that they allow a speedy and cheap production of the dental implants. Furthermore, the manufacture of the dental implant by injection molding circumvents the additional step of providing the macroscopic roughness, and is thus quick. In addition, it has an excellent reproducibility and there is no contamination with particles from sandblasting.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">In case the hydrophilic surface of the dental implants is not directly covered with the protective layer according to the present invention, it is preferred to treat the surface by O<sub>2</sub> plasma cleaning immediately prior coating with the protective coating. It could be shown, that the hydrophilicity of the surface could be reconstituted the hydrophilicity fast and effective.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">The etching of step 3) is preferably carried out by an etching solution comprising at least 50 % by volume, more preferably at least 80 % by volume of concentrated hydrofluoric acid. Etching with this etching solution leads after a relatively short etching time to a uniform topography over the whole surface treated. The etching solution can further comprise at least one compound selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, nitric acid, ammonium fluoride, sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, hydrofluoric acid and bromic acid. Preferably, the etching solution comprises sulfuric acid in an amount of 50 by volume at most or concentrated hydrofluoric acid. The etching time depends highly on the etching solution<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> used and typically ranges from about 10 seconds to about 120 minutes. The etching time is preferably 1 minute to 60 minutes, more preferably 1 minute to about 20 minutes and most preferably about 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Preferably, at least part or the entire surface having a contact angle of less than 20Â° is then covered by the protective layer. This can be done for example by dipping the implant after step a) into an aqueous solution comprising the water-soluble nonionic dextran having a molecular weight of more than 15'000 Da and further optional ingredients. However, other methods to apply the aqueous solution to the surface to be protected are possible as well, but if nonionic dextran is applied as a solution, it has to be dissolved in water since organic solvents, such as ethanol, destroy the hydrophilicity of the implant surface to be protected.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">Preferably, the drying in step c) is carried out by microwave treatment or by drying in a convection oven, a vacuum oven or in an airstream, said airstream preferably having a temperature of 20Â°C to 50Â°C, most preferably of 30Â°C to 40Â°C. Preferably, the implants according to the present invention are dried in the convection oven at 50 to 80Â°C, preferably at 70Â°C, for 10 to 120 minutes, preferably for 15 to 90 minutes, most preferably for 20 to 60 minutes, ensuring that the protective layer is dried out completely. If salts are present, the crystal water may remain in the protective layer. The above drying method does not induce splatters of the coating substance on the sample and ensures a constant thickness of the protective coating.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>1.2. Static contact angle measurements, sessile drop method</b></heading>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Contact angle measurements were performed in order to determine the degree of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. Usually, the contact angles of plates and discs were determined by static contact angle measurements. The static contact angles were determined using a sessile drop test with ultrapure water (EasyDrop DSA20E, KrÃ¼ss GmbH). The water droplets with a size of 0.3 Âµl were dosed using an automated unit. Values for contact angles were calculated by fitting a circular segment function to the contour of the droplet placed on the surface. Contact angles were determined after rinsing (washing) the samples with ultrapure water for about 15 seconds followed by blow drying in a stream of Ar in order to remove the coating. Contact angles were measured after different storage<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> periods in air. Samples were stored for up to 166 days.</p>

<p id="p0103" num="0103">The long-term study was performed with ZLA discs (Ceramtec) and ZLA implants (Straumann, Villeret) where samples were stored in air for 30 and 60 days. Some of the ZLA discs were even stored for 166 days.</p>

Contact angles of 14.2Â° and 18.7Â° weremeasured for ZLA discs coated with 1 M NaCl after storage in air for 30 and 60 days, respectively. The lowest contact angle could be measured for dextran and MgCl<sub>2</sub>/NaCl coatings with values below 5Â° after 60 days.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">For all samples, except for coatings containing dextran or the MgCl<sub>2</sub>/NaCl coating, slightly higher contact angles were<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> measured for washed samples after 166 days. For MgCl<sub>2</sub>/NaCl and the dextran coatings, contact angles below 5Â° were measured. The biggest increase from 18.7Â° to 32.9Â° was measured for the NaCl coating. Only minor differences in contact angle were present for samples that underwent the stress cycle. No effect could be measured for dextran coated samples. In case of glucose coatings, the stress cycle lead to a rearrangement of the coating resulting in a new orientation of glucose crystals on the surface.</p>

These layers were not hygroscopic like MgCl<sub>2</sub> (DCA 18.9Â° after 30 days) or the mixture MgCl<sub>2</sub>/NaCl with a DCA of 18.2Â° after 30 days. The saccharide coatings led to low DCA of 15.3Â° for glucose, 12.7Â° for dextran and 11.9Â° for the dextran/SrCl<sub>2</sub> coated implants after 60 days. SEM analyses (<figref idref="f0009">Figure 9</figref>) of coated implants have shown that saccharide coatings formed smooth and thin layers with a closed surface over a wide area. All coating solutions were coloured with methylene blue. The layer thickness of dextran decreases towards the edge of the thread. The NaCl coating formed more crystals on the flank and edge of the thread with big non-coated areas in the valley of the thread. In comparison, the dextran coating led to much more complete layers.</p>
