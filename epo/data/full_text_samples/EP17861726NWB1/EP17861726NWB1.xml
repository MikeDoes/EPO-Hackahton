<p id="p0040" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="f0005">FIGS. 5</figref> and <figref idref="f0006">6</figref>, in linear actuator 100, coil 40 stops in a state in which first leg portion 51 and second leg portion 52 of coil yoke 50 are in abutment with first support end portion 14a of first hold portion 14 and second support end portion 15a of second hold portion 15 at the same time. The positions of coil yoke 50 and coil 40 in the stop state in abutment with first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a are the stop positions of coil yoke 50 and coil 40 set in linear actuator 100. Coil yoke 50 in the stop position is supported and held by first support end portion 14a of first hold portion 14 and second support end portion 15a of second hold portion 15.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">When coil yoke 50 and coil 40 are in the stop state in stop position, first leg portion 51 and second leg portion 52 are attracted and held by first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a by magnetic attractive force of a magnetic field existing in first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a. In coil yoke 50, as illustrated by a void arrow in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, magnetic flux is formed to circulate in coil yoke 50, passing from second support<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> end portion 15a through second leg portion 52, bottom portion 53, and first leg portion 51 in sequence and reach first support end portion 14a. This magnetic flux passes through coil yoke 50 to surround coil 40 from outside to inside between second support end portion 15a and first support end portion 14a. Accordingly, coil yoke 50 is attracted by first support end portion 14a and second hold portion 15 by strong magnetic attractive force. As a result, even when external force such as vibration or shock acts on linear actuator 100, coil yoke 50 and coil 40 can be held in the stop positions.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIGS. 7</figref> and <figref idref="f0008">8</figref>, when coil 40 in the stop state is moved, an electric current is flown into coil 40 in direction D1 along the outer peripheral direction of coil 40. The electric current in direction D1 flows in coil 40 at a portion between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 in the X axis positive direction from first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 to coil yoke 50, and at a portion outside second side yoke portion 12 in the X axis negative direction from coil yoke 50 to second side yoke portion 12.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">By the action of the electric current flowing in direction D1 between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 and the magnetic flux generated by magnet 30 between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12, Lorentz force acts on coil 40 in the Z axis positive direction as a direction separating from first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a. The electric current flowing in coil 40 forms a magnetic field. Accordingly, as indicated by a hatched arrow in <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, magnetic flux is formed in coil yoke 50 from first leg portion 51 through bottom portion 53 to second leg portion 52. This magnetic flux is repulsive magnetic flux in the direction opposite to the attractive magnetic flux illustrated by the void arrow in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. The magnetic flux in coil yoke 50 forms S and N magnetic polarities at ends of first leg portion 51 and second leg portion 52. Accordingly, magnetic repulsive<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> force is generated between first leg portion 51 and first support end portion 14a and between second leg portion 52 and second support end portion 15a. Accordingly, coil 40 is moved in the Z axis positive direction of the axial direction by the magnetic repulsive force and the Lorentz force acting on coil yoke 50. Coil 40 under the two forces is movable even when the value of applied current is low, as compared to the case in which the foregoing repulsive force is not generated. Coil 40 does not consume electric power while being held by first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In an alternative linear actuator 100 not falling under the scope of the claims, coil yoke 50 may have only first leg portion 51 or second leg portion 52 and main yoke 10 may have only first support end portion 14a or second support end portion 15a to produce the same operations as described above. That is, coil 40 is held in the stop state by the magnetic attractive force, and is moved in the state with a flow of electric current by the Lorentz force and the magnetic repulsive force.</p>
<heading id="h0011">[1-3. Advantageous effects]</heading>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">As described above, linear actuator 100 includes: coil 40 that is movably provided; coil yoke 50 as a magnetic body that is provided to move integrally with coil 40; first side yoke portion 11 as a first yoke that extends outside of coil 40; second side yoke portion 12 as a second yoke that is surrounded by coil 40, extends, and is opposed to first side yoke portion 11; and magnet 30 that forms a magnetic field between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Coil yoke 50 extends along the axis of coil 40. At least one of first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 has first hold portion 14 and/or second hold portion 15 as a support portion, the support portion supporting coil yoke 50 in the stop position and having a magnetic polarity.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the foregoing configuration, coil yoke 50 in the stop position is<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> supported by first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15, for example, in a state attracted by first support end portion 14a and second support end portion 15a, by magnetic attractive force of first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15 having magnetic polarities. Accordingly, even when external force such as vibration or shock acts on linear actuator 100, movement of coil yoke 50 and coil 40 in the stop state in the stop position is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">When an electric current is flown into coil 40, coil 40 can receive Lorentz force in a direction separating from first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15 by the action of the electric current and a magnetic field between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">In addition, the electric current of coil 40 forms a magnetic field, thereby to form a magnetic field in coil yoke 50. The Lorentz force necessary for the movement of coil 40 and coil yoke 50 can be reduced by repulsion between the magnetic field of coil yoke 50 and the magnetic field of first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15, as compared to a case without generation of repulsion. This suppresses power consumption in coil 40.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">In linear actuator 100 according to the first exemplary embodiment, coil yoke 50 extends to cross coil 40 from outside of coil 40 to inside of coil 40, and first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 respectively have first hold portion 14 as first support portion and second hold portion 15 as a second support portion. Coil yoke 50 contacts first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">In the foregoing configuration, at the time of application of an electric current to coil 40, a magnetic field is generated in coil yoke 50 inside and outside of coil 40. Accordingly, it is possible to strengthen a magnetic repulsive force between the magnetic field of coil yoke 50 and the magnetic field of first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">In linear actuator 100 according to the first exemplary embodiment, first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15 have magnetic polarities opposite to each other. Coil yoke 50 is configured to, by contact with first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15, form magnetic flux passing through coil yoke 50 and crossing coil 40 from outside of coil 40 to inside of coil 40.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">In the foregoing configuration, magnetic flux is formed to flow in first hold portion 14, coil yoke 50, and second hold portion 15 in sequence. This strengthens the magnetic attractive force between coil yoke 50 and first hold portion 14, second hold portion 15. In addition, adjusting the electric current to be applied to coil 40 makes it possible to generate a flow of magnetic flux in a direction opposite to the flow of magnetic flux described above in coil yoke 50 and produce effectively magnetic repulsive force between the magnetic field of coil yoke 50 and the magnetic field of first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In linear actuator 100 according to the first exemplary embodiment, magnet 30 is disposed at least at one of first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 between first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12, and first side yoke portion 11 and second side yoke portion 12 are magnetically connected together.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">In the foregoing configuration, magnetic flux is formed to flow from first side yoke portion 11 to second side yoke portion 12. This allows the magnetic field of magnet 30 to produce magnetic polarities in first hold portion 14 and second hold portion 15. This simplifies a structure of linear actuator 100.</p>

This facilitates manufacture of linear actuator 200. Modifying the configuration of sub yoke 220 makes it possible to change linear actuator 200 to linear actuator 100 according to the first exemplary embodiment.</p>

<p id="p0123" num="0123">Referring to <figref idref="f0023">FIG. 23</figref>, in this example, lens barrel 300 constitutes a small-size lens barrel that can be installed in various in-vehicle cameras, small-size digital still cameras such as surveillance cameras, or digital video cameras. Lens barrel 300 includes bottomed cylindrical cover 310, first lens 411a exposed from cover 310, and narrow and long plate-shaped terminal 320. Cover 310 includes cylindrical side cover 310a and bottom cover 310b. Side cover 310a and bottom cover 310b are assembled together to form a storage space inside. Side cover 310a and bottom cover 310b are produced by resin molding, for example. A plurality of lens units, linear actuator 200, and others are provided in the storage space of cover 310. First lens 411a is a lens disposed on an outermost side among the plurality of lens units, and is exposed to outside from an opening in side cover 310a. Terminal 320 electrically connects an electrical component such as coil 40 in linear actuator 200 inside cover 310 and an electrical component outside cover 310.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">Bottom cover 310b is attached to a substrate on which an imaging element not illustrated is disposed. Bottom cover 310b integrally includes a plurality of circular cylindrical pins 311a for positioning lens barrel 300 on the substrate of the imaging element and a plurality of leg portions 311b for fixing lens barrel 300 to the substrate of the imaging element.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">The plurality of pins 311a performs positioning of lens barrel 300 to the imaging element by being inserted into positioning holes formed in the substrate of the imaging element. The plurality of leg portions 311b has through holes into which tightening members such as screws are to be inserted. By leg<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> portions 311b and the tightening members passing through the substrate of the imaging element, leg portions 311b are fixed to the substrate, and thus lens barrel 300 is fixed to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="f0024 f0025 f0026 f0027">FIGS. 24 to 27</figref>, linear actuator 200 is disposed on bottom cover 310b. Linear actuator 200 is fixed by positioning sub yoke 220 having third hold portion 221 and fourth hold portion 222 on bottom cover 310b.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">Specifically, sub yoke 220 is fixed to bottom cover 310b by tightening members such as screws penetrating through sub yoke 220 and bottom cover 310b. Coil 40 of linear actuator 200 is movable in a direction coming closer to bottom cover 310b and in a direction separating from bottom cover 310b. For example, coil 40 is held in the first stop position as illustrated in <figref idref="f0024">FIG. 24</figref> and is held in the second stop position as illustrated in <figref idref="f0025">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">Lens barrel 300 includes three lens units 410, 420, and 430 aligned in one line and a plurality of guide members 440 supporting and guiding second lens unit 420. Third lens unit 430 is embedded in bottom cover 310b. Third lens unit 430 includes lens 431 to reflect an image of light having entered from second lens unit 420 into lens 431 on the imaging element or like (not illustrated) disposed outside bottom cover 310b.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">First lens unit 410 is disposed in the opening of side cover 310a and is fixed to side cover 310a. First lens unit 410 includes a plurality of lenses 411 and is disposed such that lenses 411 are opposed to lens 431 of third lens unit 430.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">First lens 411a is positioned on the outermost side among the plurality of lenses 411. Around the opening in side cover 310a, annular seal material 311c is provided between first lens 411a and side cover 310a. Seal material 311c is produced from a flexible or elastic resin or like to seal between first lens 411a and side cover 310a in a water-tight or air-tight manner. This suppresses<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> ingress of water, foreign matter, and others from outside into cover 310. Light from outside of cover 310 enters first lens unit 410.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">Second lens unit 420 is disposed between first lens unit 410 and third lens unit 430. Second lens unit 420 is disposed such that the plurality of guide members 440 penetrates through unit cover 421 of second lens unit 420. Each of guide members 440 is formed from a bar-shaped member. Guide members 440 extend from bottom cover 310b along movement direction of coil 40 in linear actuator 200. In this example, two guide members 440 are disposed.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">Second lens unit 420 is movable along an axis of the plurality of guide members 440. Accordingly, second lens unit 420 can be moved in a direction coming closer to bottom cover 310b and in a direction separating from bottom cover 310b. In addition, second lens unit 420 includes a plurality of lenses 422 and is disposed such that lenses 422 are opposed to lens 431 of third lens unit 430 and lens 411 of first lens unit 410. Further, unit cover 421 of second lens unit 420 is fixed to coil 40 such that second lens unit 420 is movable together with coil 40.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">Accordingly, when coil 40 moves between the first stop position and the second stop position, second lens unit 420 moves together with coil 40 while being guided by guide members 440. Guide members 440 also guide the movement of coil 40. Coil 40 and second lens unit 420 can be stopped in a state held by magnetic attractive force in the two stop positions, that is, the first stop position as illustrated in <figref idref="f0024">FIGS. 24</figref> and <figref idref="f0026">26</figref> and the second stop position as illustrated in <figref idref="f0025">FIGS. 25</figref> and <figref idref="f0027">27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">In lens barrel 300, when coil 40 is in the first stop position, second lens unit 420 is positioned near first lens unit 410. Accordingly, first lens unit 410 to third lens unit 430 can receive, out of light incident on lenses 411, light at as a relatively narrow viewing angle as 60° close to a human's static viewing angle,<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> for example, and reflect the same on the imaging element (not illustrated). At this time, lens barrel 300 is in the telephoto-side state and acts as a telescopic lens.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">When coil 40 is in the second stop position, second lens unit 420 is separated from first lens unit 410. Accordingly, first lens unit 410 to third lens unit 430 can receive, out of light incident on lenses 411, light at as a wide viewing angle as 180°, for example, and reflect the same on the imaging element not illustrated. At this time, lens barrel 300 is in the wide-side state and acts as a wide-angle lens.</p>
<p id="p0136" num="0136">Accordingly, lens barrel 300 acts as a bifocal type lens barrel that can selectively switch between two viewing angles, and hold the switched viewing angle and suppress fluctuation in viewing angle resulting from external force such as vibration and shock. The viewing angle set to lens barrel 300 is not limited to the foregoing example but may be any viewing angle.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">Unit cover 421 has position detection projection 421a integrally formed. Position detection projection 421a protrudes from unit cover 421 sideways, that is, in a direction approximately perpendicular to the axial direction of guide members 440. Projection 421a moves together with coil 40 and unit cover 421.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">Further, two position detection sensors 421b and 421c are disposed in cover 310. Each of position detection sensors 421b and 421c has a U outer shape. Position detection sensors 421b and 421c are electrically connected to terminal 320 and are configured to flow light, magnetism, and others between the U shapes.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">Position detection sensors 421b and 421c detect interruption of light, magnetism, and others, specifically, interruption of light, magnetism, and others by projection 421a positioned between the U shapes, that is, detect projection 421a. Position detection sensors 421b and 421c are disposed to detect projection<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> 421a when coil 40 is in the first stop position and the second stop position. Accordingly, position detection sensors 421b and 421c detect whether coil 40 is in the first stop position or the second position, that is, whether lens barrel 300 is in the telephoto-side state or wide-side state. Therefore, in lens barrel 300, a state of lens barrel 300 can be controlled and checked.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">In addition, main yoke 210 of linear actuator 200 is not fixed to sub yoke 220 but is provided in such a manner as to be movable with respect to sub yoke 220 in the Z axis direction as the movement direction of coil 40. For example, main yoke 210 engages or fits with sub yoke 220 in such a manner capable of movement such as sliding. Main yoke 210 is fixed to side cover 310a in such a manner capable of position adjustment.</p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Referring to <figref idref="f0011">FIGS. 11</figref> and <figref idref="f0026">26</figref>, cylindrical projection 216 and female screw hole 217 are formed in first side yoke portion 211 of main yoke 210. First through hole 312 and second through hole 313 are formed in an angular cylindrical wall of side cover 310a at positions respectively corresponding to female screw hole 217 and projection 216.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">Second through hole 313 is formed with an inner diameter larger than projection 216. By inserting projection 216 into second through hole 313, main yoke 210 is roughly positioned with respect to side cover 310a. Projection 216 and second through hole 313 are elements for roughly positioning main yoke 210.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">First through hole 312 is shaped such that its inner diameter decreases with step portion 312a from outside to inside of cover 310. The inner diameter of first through hole 312 changes from step portion 312a. A portion of first through hole 312 with a smaller inner diameter constitutes an inner diameter of ring-shaped step portion 312a, which is larger than an inner diameter of female screw hole 217. A portion of first through hole 312 with a larger inner diameter constitutes an outer diameter of step portion 312a.<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --></p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">With first through hole 312 and female screw hole 217 aligned with each other, main yoke 210 is fixed to side cover 310a by screw 330 as a tightening member. At this time, a male screw shaft of screw 330 with a male screw passes through first through hole 312 and screws into female screw hole 217, and a diameter-increased head of screw 330 is larger than the inner diameter of step portion 312a and engages with step portion 312a. The smaller inner diameter of first through hole 312 is larger than an outer diameter of the male screw shaft of screw 330, which forms a gap between an inner surface of first through hole 312 and the male screw shaft of screw 330.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">Accordingly, when screw 330 is loosened, the gap permits screw 330 to move together with main yoke 210 in first through hole 312 in a radial direction of first through hole 312. At this time, main yoke 210 can move with respect to side cover 310a and sub yoke 220 in the Z axis direction and in an outer peripheral direction of side cover 310a.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">This allows fine adjustments of a distance between the first stop position and the second stop position of coil 40 in linear actuator 200. Accordingly, this allows fine adjustments of the stop position of second lens unit 420 to first lens unit 410 and third lens unit 430, that is, fine adjustments of a focal distance between the lens units. By tightening screw 330, main yoke 210 is fixed to side cover 310a, that is, cover 310 at the adjusted position.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">Further, an adhesive is injected into first through hole 312 and second through hole 313 to fix main yoke 210 and cover 310 firmly to each other. The shape of first through hole 312 may be elongated in the longitudinal direction along the Z axis direction.</p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">This makes it possible to extend the adjustable width of main yoke 210 in the Z axis direction, which increases an adjustable margin of the focal distance between the lens units.<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --></p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">As described above, linear actuator 200 further includes cover 310 containing coil 40, coil yoke 250, main yoke 210, and sub yoke 220, and screw 330 as a tightening member for fixing main yoke 210 to cover 310. Main yoke 210 is provided to be movable with respect to sub yoke 220, and cover 310 has first through hole 312 through which the shaft of screw 330 passes. There is formed a gap between the inner surface of first through hole 312 and the shaft of screw 330 to permit the movement of screw 330 together with main yoke 210.</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">In the foregoing configuration, when fixation to cover 310 by screw 330 is loosened, main yoke 210 can move relatively to cover 310 and sub yoke 220 separately from sub yoke 220 by the thickness of the gap. This allows position adjustment of main yoke 210 with respect to cover 310 and sub yoke 220. This also allows adjustment of the distance between the two stop positions of coil 40.</p>
