<heading id="h0001"><b>Technical Field</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the field of vaccines. More specifically the present disclosure relates to compositions and methods for enhancing immune responses induced by vaccines, including vaccines targeted at secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>Background</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Influenza and its complications are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that influenza epidemics in the developed world cause at least 250,000-500,000 deaths and severe illness in 3-5 million people annually. The impact of influenza in the developing world is likely to be even higher.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Influenza infection is generally characterised by the onset of constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever, headache, myalgia, severe malaise, nausea) and respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough and sore throat). With the exception of particularly virulent strains (e.g. the 1918 pandemic flu strain, H5N1 "bird flu") capable of inducing viral pneumonia and pulmonary failure, influenza viruses are generally not sufficiently virulent to inflict serious illness or death on their own. However, secondary infections associated with influenza infection frequently cause pneumonia and other serious complications which may often prove fatal. For example, the high mortality rates experienced during the pandemics of 1918-1919 and 1957-1958 have been largely attributed to complications arising from secondary bacterial infections, and secondary bacterial pneumonia has been estimated to cause at least 20,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Secondary complications arising during influenza infection are also not restricted to those arising from pathogenic bacteria. Allergic responses can be enhanced during influenza infection, particularly those instigated by respiratory allergens. In addition, secondary viral infections (e.g. rhinovirus, coronavirus) may also arise during the course of flu infection.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Seasonal multivalent vaccines are the most common form of vaccination against influenza, however, the immunity induced by these vaccines is limited and generally restricted to the particular target strains included in the formulation. Although alternative influenza vaccines are available most suffer the disadvantage of providing little or no cross-protective immunity (i.e. immunity to multiple different strains) and consequently<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> are not widely used. In addition, current flu vaccines provide inadequate protection against the development of secondary infections and conditions which are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both local influenza outbreaks and major influenza pandemics.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2010012045A1"><text>WO2010/012045A1</text></patcit> as well as <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Alsharifi et al, 2009, PloS ONE Volume 4, Issue 4, e5336</text></nplcit>, disclose methods for the treatment or prevention of an influenza virus infection in a subject. Diebold et al ((<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Diebold et al. Innate Antiviral Responses by Means of TLR7-Mediated Recognition of Single-Stranded RNA, Science, 2004; 303(5663): 1529-1531</text></nplcit>) teaches that <u>heat-inactivated</u> influenza virus ssRNA at certain temperatures can trigger IFN-α responses and could thus be exploited as an adjuvant for vaccination. The patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2007092315A2"><text>WO2007/092315A2</text></patcit> relates to immunogenic compositions and more particularly to complexes formed between viruses and oligonucleotides with enhanced immunogenic properties.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, a general need exists for agents capable of enhancing immune responses induced by vaccines. In addition, there is a need for more effective treatments capable of preventing or alleviating secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection.</p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>Definitions</b></heading>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">As used in this application, the singular form "a", "an" and "the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the term "an immunogen" also includes a plurality of immunogens.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">As used herein, the term "comprising" means "including." Variations of the word "comprising", such as "comprise" and "comprises," have correspondingly varied meanings. Thus, for example, a vaccine "comprising" an immunogen may consist exclusively of that immunogen or may include one or more additional substances (including additional immunogens).</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, includes within its meaning a non-toxic but sufficient amount a compound or composition for use in the present disclosure to provide the desired therapeutic effect. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject depending on factors such as the species being treated, the age and general condition of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, the particular agent being administered and the mode of administration and so forth.

<heading id="h0006"><b>Detailed Description</b></heading>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">Secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of these secondary complications can be attributed at least in part due to the inability of current vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity against heterologous influenza strains. Recipients of current vaccines are generally still susceptible to infection by many existing flu strains and have little if any immunity against newly emerging strains, some of which may form the basis of future flu pandemics. The protection offered by current vaccines is thus limited and this in turn contributes significantly to the prevalence of secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection. Compositions and methods of the present disclosure induce cross-protective immunity (i.e. immunity against heterologous flu strains) and are therefore useful for preventing and/or treating secondary infections or conditions associated with flu infection. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present disclosure relate to compositions and methods for enhancing the immune responses against secondary infections or conditions associated with influenza infection.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">Vaccination of individuals against certain causative agents (e.g. microorganisms, allergens etc.) may assist in preventing secondary infections and conditions upon influenza virus infection. However, the potential benefits of pre-emptive vaccination against secondary agent(s) may be compromised due to a number of factors arising upon influenza infection. Without restriction to particular mechanisms or modes of action, it is firstly postulated that the burden of an influenza virus infection means that many individuals may not have a sufficient threshold level of immunity required to protect against secondary infection, regardless of prior vaccination against the relevant agent(s). Secondly, it is believed that synergistic interactions occurring between influenza virus and secondary pathogens (e.g. bacteria) may create a favourable environment enhancing persistence of secondary pathogens even in the face of prior vaccination. Thirdly, is it hypothesised that the pro-inflammatory immune environment induced by influenza virus infection may reduce thresholds of allergen responsiveness (i.e. reduce the dosage of allergen needed to invoke an allergic immune response).<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">The capacity of vaccination to prevent secondary infections and conditions upon influenza virus infection is therefore limited. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present disclosure relate to compositions and methods for enhancing the immune response induced by vaccines against secondary infections or conditions associated with influenza infection.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">Given the prevalence of secondary infections and conditions in flu-infected individuals, treatments capable of providing immunity against both the influenza virus and secondary infections/conditions are particularly desirable. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a synergistic combination of components capable of inducing immunity against both infection by influenza virus and at least one other agent causative of an associated secondary infection or condition. Without restriction to a particular mechanism or mode of action, it is believed that the component of the combination providing immunity against influenza virus (gamma-irradiated flu virus) provides an adjuvant effect for the additional component(s) that induce immunity against secondary infections and conditions. Hence, the present disclosure provides effective treatments capable of preventing or alleviating both influenza infection and secondary infections/conditions associated with influenza infection.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">In addition, the present inventors have surprisingly identified that gamma-irradiated influenza viruses enhance immune responses induced by co-administered vaccines targeted at diseases and conditions that occur independently of influenza infection.</p>
<heading id="h0007"><b>Compositions</b></heading>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">The present disclosure provides gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and compositions comprising the same. Compositions of the present disclosure may comprise immunogen(s) capable of stimulating an immune response against agent(s) causative of secondary infection(s) or condition(s) associated with influenza infection. In certain embodiments, compositions of the disclosure are preventative and/or therapeutic vaccines.</p>
<heading id="h0008"><i>Gamma-irradiated influenza virus</i></heading>
<p id="p0112" num="0112">A gamma-irradiated influenza virus in accordance with the present disclosure may be derived from a subtype of the genus influenza virus A (type A), influenza virus B (type B), or influenza virus C (type C). Also contemplated are inter-subtype recombinants.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">Suitable subtypes of influenza virus A include, but are not limited to, H1N1 (e.g. H1N1 09 Swine Flu/pandemic influenza A (H1N1)), H1N2, H1N7, H2N2, H3N1, H3N2,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> H3N8, H4N8, H5N1 (e.g. HPAI A(H5N1)), H5N2, H5N3, H5N8, H5N9, H6N5, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N7, H8N4, H9N2, H10N7, H11N6, H12N5, H13N6, H14N5, and any other recombinant virus arising from re-assortment between influenza A subtypes.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">In certain embodiments, the virus is an H1N1 subtype virus. The H1N1 virus may be strain APR/8/34.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">Influenza viruses for use in accordance with the present disclosure can be generated using methods known in the art. For example, influenza viruses may be derived by serial passaging in embryonated eggs as described, for example, in <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>Coico et al., (Eds) (2007), "Current Protocols in Microbiology", John Wiley and Sons, Inc. </text></nplcit>(see in particular Unit 15G.1 entitled <i>"Influenza: Propagation, Quantification, and Storage"</i>)<i>.</i> A brief description of this technique is provided below.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">Embryonated eggs may be obtained 9-12 days after fertilization and candled to locate the air sac. The egg may then be pierced under aseptic conditions, and the seed-virus inoculated into the air-space with a syringe. The procedure may be carried out manually or automatically by machines. The inoculated egg may then be incubated for approximately two to three days in a humidified atmosphere. At the end of this period, the egg can be maintained at approximately 4°C if desired in order to terminate the embryo and aid clarification of the allantoic fluid. The top of the egg may then be removed, the membrane pierced, and the allantoic fluid collected. Again this can be achieved manually, or by automated machinery. The allantoic fluid may be clarified, for example, by centrifugation to remove cell debris and/or subjected to further purification prior to or following inactivation of the influenza virus by gamma-irradiation. Purification of allantoic fluid may be achieved for example, by temperature-dependent adsorption to chicken red blood cells (CRBC), sucrose gradient, or dialysis.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">Modifications of the above-mentioned process also suitable for the production of influenza virus are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US7270990B"><text>United States Patent No. 7,270,990</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2002067983A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 2002/067983</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2005113756A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 2005/113756</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">Additionally or alternatively, influenza virus for use in use in accordance with the present disclosure may be generated in cell culture (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>Furminger, (1998), "Vaccine production", in Nicholson et al.

<p id="p0119" num="0119">Non-limiting examples of suitable cell lines that may be used as substrates for the growth of influenza virus include vero cells, Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, PERC6 cells (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US7192759B"><text>United States Patent No. 7,192,759</text></patcit>), chicken embryo cells (e.g. chicken embryo fibroblasts) and avian embryonic cell lines (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO2006108846A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 2006/108846</text></patcit>). Variants of these cell lines may be used, including, but not limited to, those described in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US6825036B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,825,036</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US6455298B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,455,298</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="WO2006108846A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 2006/108846</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">Propagation of influenza virus using cell lines will, in general, involve expanding the cells to the desired quantity in a chemically defined medium. Preferably, the medium is a serum free medium. Propagation of the virus can be assisted by the addition of proteases to the medium. Generally, the cells are infected with influenza virus and incubated for a period of time sufficient to generate the required numbers of virus (e.g. several days). Parameters such as multiplicity of infection, incubation time and temperature will generally need to be optimised for the specific cell line used and/or specific influenza strain/s being propagated. The optimisation of growth parameters including those referred to above can be readily determined by a person of ordinary skill in the field without undue experimentation. Following the incubation period, the virus may be harvested and purified if so desired.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">Non-limiting examples of processes suitable for the production of influenza virus in cell culture include those described in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5698433A"><text>United States Patent No. 5,698,433</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US5753489A"><text>United States Patent No. 5,753,489</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="US6146873A"><text>United States Patent No. 6,146,873</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="US6455298B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,455,298</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="US6951752B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,951,752</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">The yield of influenza virus production in cell culture may be enhanced, for example, by modifying cellular genes encoding the protein kinase PKR or (2'-5') oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase genes (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="US6673591B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,673,591</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="US6686190B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,686,190</text></patcit>), or modifying the viral backbone with an alternative nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="WO2005024039A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 2005/024039</text></patcit>). Additionally or alternatively, cell lines utilised for the propagation of influenza virus may over-express sialyltransferase (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US7132271B"><text>United States Patent No. 7,132,271</text></patcit>).</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">Influenza virus propagated using the methods above (or by any other means) may be purified and/or concentrated prior to gamma-irradiation. Any suitable method known in the art may be used for this purpose. For example, influenza virus may be purified by temperature-dependent adsorption to chicken red blood cells using the method described in <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="b"><text>Laver, (1969), "Purification of influenza virus", HKaS NP (Ed), New York and<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> London: Academic Press, pp. 82-86</text></nplcit>. Additionally or alternatively, influenza virus may be purified by density gradient centrifugation (see, for example,<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text> Sokolov et al., (1971), "Purification and concentration of influenza virus", Archiv fiir die gesarate Virusforschung, 35, 356-363</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">In certain embodiments, influenza virus is purified and/or concentrated prior to gamma-irradiation using tangential/cross-flow filtration. For example, virus-containing fluid may be applied to a filtering device such as a membrane having an appropriate pore size (e.g. less than about 80nm). The fluid is pumped tangentially along the surface of the membrane (i.e. across the surface) and pressure applied to force a portion of the fluid through the membrane to the filtrate side. The applied pressure will generally be of a degree that does not adversely affect virion structure and/or the integrity of viral antigens. Filtrate containing viral particles passes through the membrane, whereas particulates and macromolecules in the fluid that are too large to pass through the membrane pores are retained on the opposing side. In general, retentate (i.e. retained components) does not build up at the surface of the membrane and is instead swept along by the tangential flow. The retentate may be re-diluted with appropriate media (e.g. PBS containing dextran and/or sucrose) and the filtration process repeated if required.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">The use of tangential/cross-flow filtration to purify influenza virus used for gamma-irradiation provides an advantage over purification techniques currently used for influenza vaccine preparation (e.g. ultracentrifugation) as the integrity of viral antigens is better preserved. This in turn enhances the immunogenicity of gamma-irradiated viral preparations, and in particular their ability to elicit cross-protective immunity against heterologous influenza subtypes and strains.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">Influenza viruses for use in accordance with the present disclosure are gamma-irradiated. Any suitable source of gamma-radiation may be used. Suitable gamma emitters include, but are not limited to Ba<sup>117</sup>, Co<sup>60</sup> , Cs<sup>137</sup>, Ir<sup>192</sup>, U<sup>235</sup>, Se<sup>75</sup> and Yb<sup>169</sup>.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">Gamma-irradiation of influenza virus may be performed using commercially available devices, for example, a Gammacell irradiator manufactured by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Canada (e.g. Gammacell 40 Irradiator, Gammacell 220 Irradiator, Gammacell 1000 irradiator, Gammacell 3000 irradiator), a gamma-irradiator manufactured by J. L. Shepherd and Associates (San Fernando, California, USA), or a Nordion Gamma Cell-1000 irradiator manufactured by Nordion Inc. (Kanata, Ontario, Canada). Other suitable devices are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US3557370A"><text>United States Patent No. 3,557,370</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US3567938A"><text>United States Patent No. 3,567,938</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">In general, the influenza virus is exposed to a dose of gamma-irradiation sufficient to inactivate the virus. Preferably, the dose of gamma-irradiation is sufficient to inactivate the virus without substantially disrupting the structure of viral antigens, and in particular without substantially disrupting the structure of viral surface antigens. The immunogenicity of antigenic determinants may therefore be retained by the gamma-irradiated virus. Preferably, the dose of gamma-irradiation is administered to the virus over a period of time and at a level sufficient to ensure that all viruses under treatment are exposed without adversely affecting the structural integrity of viral antigenic determinants.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">Influenza virus for use in accordance with the present disclosure may be exposed to a total dose of gamma-irradiation in the range of about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad (or about 10 Gy to about 2x10<sup>4</sup> kGy). In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, influenza virus is exposed to a total dose of gamma-irradiation of between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>8</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>7</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>6</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>5</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 1 X 10<sup>4</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>3</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>4</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>5</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>6</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>7</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad, between about 1 X 10<sup>8</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad or between about 1 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> rad.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the influenza virus is exposed to a total dose of gamma-rays of between about 6.5 X 10<sup>4</sup> rad and about 2 X 10<sup>7</sup> rad (about 0.65 KGy to about 200 kGy). In preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the influenza virus is exposed to a total gamma-irradiation dose of about 1.26 X 10<sup>6</sup> rad (12.6 KGy), a total gamma-irradiation dose of about 1 X 10<sup>6</sup> rad (about 10 kGy) gamma-rays or a total gamma-irradiation dose of about 1 X 10<sup>5</sup> rad (1 KGy).</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">The optimal dose of gamma-irradiation may be influenced by factors such as the medium in which the virus is present, the amount of virus to be treated, the temperature of the virus present, and/or the subtype or strain of virus under treatment. Accordingly, the total dose of gamma-irradiation, the exposure time and/or the level of gamma-irradiation applied over the period of exposure may be optimised to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">The total dose of gamma-irradiation may be administered to the virus cumulatively over a period of time. For example, gamma-irradiation may be administered to the virus<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> at a level lower than that of the total dose, over a time period sufficient to achieve the total dose of gamma-irradiation required.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">In one embodiment, influenza virus preparations are maintained in a frozen state while being exposed to gamma-irradiation. This may facilitate the preservation of biological integrity and avoid unnecessary damage of viral antigens thereby enhancing the immunogenicity of gamma-irradiated viral preparations, and in particular, their ability to elicit cross-reactive/cross-protective immunity against multiple influenza types, subtypes and strains. In general, a gamma-irradiation dose of 10-20kGy may be effective for treating frozen viral preparations.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">As mentioned above, it is preferable that treatment with gamma-irradiation is sufficient to inactivate the influenza virus without substantially disrupting the structure of viral antigens. Inactivation of the virus may be assessed using methods generally known in the art. For example, viral infectivity can be measured following gamma-irradiation by inoculating embryonic eggs and/or cell lines as described in the paragraphs above to determine whether the virus is capable of propagation.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">The integrity of antigenic determinants can be assessed, for example, by assaying the virus for hemagglutinating activity following gamma-irradiation.

<p id="p0207" num="0207">Any suitable adjuvant may be included in a composition of the present disclosure. For example, an aluminium-based adjuvant may be utilised. Suitable aluminium-based adjuvants include, but are not limited to, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate and combinations thereof. Other specific examples of aluminium-based adjuvants that may be utilised are described in <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="EP1216053A"><text>European Patent No. 1216053</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="US6372223B"><text>United States Patent No. 6,372,223</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0208" num="0208">Oil in water emulsions may be utilised as adjuvants in compositions of the present disclosure. Oil in water emulsions are well known in the art. In general, the oil in water emulsion will comprise a metabolisable oil, for example, a fish oil, a vegetable oil, or a synthetic oil. Examples of suitable oil in water emulsions include those described in <patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="EP0399843A"><text>European Patent No. 0399843</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0029" dnum="US7029678B"><text>United States Patent No. 7,029,678</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0030" dnum="WO2007006939A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 2007/006939</text></patcit>. The oil in water emulsion may be utilised in combination with other adjuvants and/or immunostimulants.</p>
<p id="p0209" num="0209">Non-limiting examples of other suitable adjuvants include immunostimulants such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), cholera toxin (CT) or its constituent subunit, heat labile enterotoxin (LT) or its constituent subunit, toll-like receptor ligand adjuvants such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and derivatives thereof (e.g. monophosphoryl lipid A and 3-Deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A), muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and F protein of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).</p>
<p id="p0210" num="0210">Adjuvants in compositions of the present disclosure typically include emollients, emulsifiers, thickening agents, preservatives, bactericides and buffering agents. Another type of "self adjuvant" is provided by the conjugation of immunogenic peptides to lipids<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> such as the water soluble lipopeptides Pam3Cys or its dipalmitoyl derivative Pam2Cys. Such adjuvants have the advantage of accompanying and immunogenic component into the antigen presenting cell (such as dendritic cells) and thus producing enhanced antigen presentation and activation of the cell at the same time. These agents act at least partly through toll-like receptor 2 (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0028" npl-type="s"><text>Brown and Jackson, (2005), "Lipid based self adjuvanting vaccines", Current Drug Delivery, 23:83</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0211" num="0211">Suitable adjuvants are commercially available such as, for example, Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, N.J.); AS-2 (SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, Pa.); aluminium salts such as aluminium hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminium phosphate; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine; acylated sugars; cationically or anionically derivatized polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A. Cytokines, such as GM-CSF or interleukin-2, -7, or -12, may also be used as adjuvants.</p>
<p id="p0212" num="0212">In certain embodiments, an adjuvant included in a composition of the present disclosure may induce an immune response predominantly of the TH1 type. Suitable adjuvants for use in eliciting a predominantly TH1-type response include, for example, a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL) together with an aluminium salt. For example, the composition or vaccine may be formulated with adjuvant AS04 containing aluminium hydroxide (alum) and 3-<i>O</i>-deacylated monophosphorylated lipid A (MPL) such as described in <nplcit id="ncit0029" npl-type="s"><text>Thoelen et al. (2001), "A prophylactic hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant system", Vaccine, 19:2400-2403</text></nplcit>. Other known adjuvants which preferentially induce a TH1 type immune response include CpG containing oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are characterised in that the CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated. Such oligonucleotides are known to those of ordinary skill in the field and are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0031" dnum="WO199602555A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 1996/02555</text></patcit>.

<p id="p0213" num="0213">Another example of an adjuvant is a saponin, preferably QS21 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Framingham, Mass.), which may be used alone or in combination with other adjuvants. For example, an enhanced adjuvant system may be utilised involving the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and saponin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as described in <patcit id="pcit0032" dnum="WO199400153A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 1994/00153</text></patcit>, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> cholesterol, as described in <patcit id="pcit0033" dnum="WO199633739A"><text>PCT publication No. WO 1996/33739</text></patcit>.

<p id="p0218" num="0218">In certain embodiments, vaccine compositions of the present disclosure comprise gamma-irradiated influenza viruses. In other embodiments, vaccine compositions of the present disclosure comprise immunogens against at least one agent causative of an<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> infection or condition (e.g. a secondary infection or condition associated with influenza infection).

<p id="p0221" num="0221">Although adjuvant(s) may be included in vaccine compositions of the present disclosure, experimental data provided herein demonstrates that gamma-irradiated influenza viruses can enhance the immunogenicity of co-administered vaccines targeting other diseases and conditions, regardless of whether those other diseases and conditions arise as a consequence of influenza infection. Vaccine compositions of the present disclosure comprising gamma-irradiated influenza viruses need not necessarily comprise or be administered with other dedicated adjuvant component(s), which may allow reactogenicity problems that can arise from using dedicated adjuvant component(s) to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p0222" num="0222">In general, adjuvant activity in the context of a vaccine composition includes, but is not limited to, the ability to enhance the immune response (quantitatively or qualitatively) induced by immunogenic components in the vaccine (e.g. gamma-irradiated influenza virus and/or immunogens against secondary agents). This may reduce the dose or level of the immunogenic components required to produce an immune response and/or reduce the number or the frequency of immunisations required to produce the desired immune response.</p>
<heading id="h0014"><i>Routes of administration</i></heading>
<p id="p0223" num="0223">Compositions of the present disclosure (including vaccines) can be administered to a recipient by standard routes, including, but not limited to, parenteral (e.g. intravenous,<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> intraspinal, subcutaneous or intramuscular), oral, topical, or mucosal routes (e.g. intranasal).</p>
<p id="p0224" num="0224">Preferably, vaccine compositions of the present disclosure are administered by the mucosal route. Non-limiting examples of acceptable routes of mucosal vaccine administration including intranasal, occular, buccal, genital tract (vaginal), rectal, intratracheal, skin, and the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p id="p0225" num="0225">Preferably, vaccine compositions of the disclosure are administered by the intranasal route. Without limitation to theory or particular mode(s) of action, intranasal administration of vaccine compositions of the present disclosure is believed to be advantageous for enhancing immunity against agents causative of secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection as both the influenza virus and many of the secondary agents enter the host through mucosal surfaces of the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts. In addition, mucosal vaccination (e.g. intranasal vaccination) may induce mucosal immunity not only in the respiratory tracts but also in distant mucosal sites including the genital mucosa.</p>
<p id="p0226" num="0226">Intranasal vaccine compositions of the present disclosure can be formulated, for example, in liquid form as nose drops, spray, or suitable for inhalation, as powder, as cream, or as emulsion. Nebulised or aerosolised intranasal vaccine compositions may also be utilised. Administration of vaccine compositions of the present disclosure to mucosa of the upper and/or lower respiratory tract via inhalation of mists, powders, or sprays, or by intranasal administration of nose drops, swabs, powders, sprays, mists, aerosols, and the like is preferred.</p>
<p id="p0227" num="0227">Vaccine compositions of the present disclosure may comprise an adjuvant such as, for example, those described in the subsection above entitled <i>"Pharmaceutical compositions".</i> Any suitable adjuvant may be included in a vaccine composition of the present disclosure and the adjuvant may be included in any suitable form (e.g. a powder, a solution, a non-vesicular solution, or a suspension).</p>
<p id="p0228" num="0228">Non-limiting examples of adjuvants suitable for inclusion in vaccine compositions of the present disclosure and methods for their preparation are also described in <i>"</i><nplcit id="ncit0032" npl-type="b"><text>Vaccine Adjuvants: Preparation Methods and Research Protocols (Methods in Molecular Medicine)", (2000), Ohagan (Ed), Humana Press Inc</text></nplcit>. Specific examples of such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, aluminum hydroxide; polypeptide adjuvants including interferons, interleukins, and other cytokines; AMPHIGEN, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions; and saponins such as QuilA.<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --></p>
<p id="p0229" num="0229">Preferably, the adjuvant is a mucosal adjuvant effective in enhancing mucosal immunity and/or systemic immunity to immunogenic components administered via the mucosal route. Mucosal adjuvants may be broadly classified as those that facilitate vaccine delivery (e.g. liposomes, cochleates, live-attenuated vectors, poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolide or PLGA, chitans, DNA vaccines, mucoadhesives) to enhance the induction of protective immunity induced by other immunogenic components of the vaccine, and those having an immunostimulatory role (e.g. innate immunity associated toxin-based, cytokine-based etc.). Without limitation to a particular mechanism, it is postulated that the advantageous effects of mucosal adjuvants partially derive from an ability to assist the passage of immunogenic components in the vaccine across the mucosal barrier. Upon traversing the mucosal barrier, the mucosal adjuvant may enhance immunity, for example, by complement activation, the induction of cytokines, stimulation of antibody production or antibody type switching, stimulating antigen presenting cells, and/or influencing MHC class I and/or class II expression.</p>
<p id="p0230" num="0230">In one embodiment, vaccine compositions of the present disclosure for intranasal administration are provided in a freeze-dried powder form capable of re-constitution immediately prior to use. Powder vaccine formulations of vaccines and compositions of the present disclosure provide a means of overcoming refrigerated storage and distribution requirements associated with liquid-based vaccine stability and delivery. Dry powder formulations offer the advantage of being more stable and also do not support microbial growth.</p>
<p id="p0231" num="0231">As demonstrated herein, freeze-dried formulations comprising gamma-inactivated influenza virus induce levels of heterosubtypic immunity similar to that of non freeze-dried formulations. Vaccine compositions of the present disclosure may be freeze-dried using any suitable technique known in the art. For example, liquid preparations of gamma-irradiated influenza virus and/or immunogens against secondary infections or conditions associated with influenza infection may be frozen in a dry ice - isopropanol slurry and lyophilized in a freeze Dryer (e.g. <nplcit id="ncit0033" npl-type="b"><text>Virtis Model 10-324 Bench, Gardiner, NY</text></nplcit>) for a suitable time period (e.g. 24 hours).</p>

Intranasal devices may produce droplets in the range 1 to 500 µm. Preferably, only a small percentage of droplets (e.g. &lt;5%) are below 10 µm to minimise the chance of inhalation. Intranasal devices may be capable of bi-dose delivery, that is, the delivery of two subdoses of a single vaccine dose, one sub-dose to each nostril.</p>
<p id="p0234" num="0234">A vaccine composition of the present disclosure may be administered to a recipient in isolation or in combination with other additional therapeutic agent(s).

<p id="p0236" num="0236">For example, the appropriate dosage of a composition of the disclosure may depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, a subject's physical characteristics (e.g. age, weight, sex), whether the compound is being used as single agent or adjuvant therapy, the type of MHC restriction of the patient, the progression (i.e. pathological<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> state) of the influenza infection and/or secondary infection(s), and other factors that may be recognized by one skilled in the art. Various general considerations that may be considered when determining an appropriate dosage of a composition of the disclosure are are described, for example, in <nplcit id="ncit0040" npl-type="b"><text>Gennaro et al.

<p id="p0241" num="0241">Typically, in therapeutic applications, the treatment would be for the duration of the disease state or condition. Further, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages will be determined by the nature and extent of the disease state or condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the nature of the particular individual being treated. Also, such optimum conditions can be determined by conventional techniques.</p>
<p id="p0242" num="0242">In many instances, it will be desirable to have several or multiple administrations of a composition of the present disclosure. For example, compositions of the present disclosure may be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more times. The administrations may be from about one to about twelve week intervals, and in certain embodiments from about one to about four week intervals. Periodic re-administration may be desirable in the case of recurrent exposure to a particular pathogen or allergen targeted by a composition of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p0243" num="0243">It will also be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment can be ascertained using conventional course of treatment determination tests.</p>

<p id="p0245" num="0245">In certain embodiments, the methods of the disclosure involve the administration of gamma-irradiated influenza virus (or compositions/vaccines comprising gamma-irradiated influenza virus) in multiple separate doses. Accordingly, the methods for the prevention (<i>i.e.</i> vaccination) and treatment of influenza virus infection described herein encompass the administration of multiple separated doses to a subject, for example, over a defined period of time. Accordingly, the methods for the prevention (<i>i.e.</i> vaccination) and treatment of influenza virus infection disclosed herein include administering a priming dose of gamma-irradiated influenza virus (or composition/vaccine comprising gamma-irradiated influenza virus) of the present disclosure. The priming dose may be followed by a booster dose. The booster may be for the purpose of revaccination.

<p id="p0247" num="0247">The present disclosure provides methods for enhancing immune responses against an infection or condition in a subject (e.g. secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza virus infection).</p>
<p id="p0248" num="0248">"Enhancing" an immune response as contemplated herein refers to augmenting the immune response, for example, innate immunity and/or adaptive immunity (e.g. humoral and/or cell mediated immune responses) of a subject against one or more target secondary infections or conditions associated with influenza virus infection.</p>
<p id="p0249" num="0249">Methods for measuring the immune response are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a biological sample from a subject treated by the methods of the present disclosure may be compared to a sample from the same subject taken prior to treatment. The immune response, for example, to an agent causative of a secondary infection or condition associated with influenza infection may be measured by way of standard assays known in the art including, but not limited to, solid-phase heterogeneous assays (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), solution phase assays (e.g. electrochemiluminescence assay), amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assays, flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, functional T-cell assays, functional B-cell assays, functional monocyte-macrophage assays, dendritic and reticular endothelial cell assays, measurement of NK cell responses, oxidative burst assays, cytotoxic specific cell lysis assays, pentamer binding assays, and phagocytosis and apoptosis evaluation.</p>
<p id="p0250" num="0250">Additionally or alternatively, the enhancement of immune responses may be determined by assessing resistance to secondary infections or conditions induced by compositions and vaccines of the present disclosure in subject(s) infected by influenza virus. Influenza-infected subjects may be administered a composition of the disclosure targeted at a particular secondary infection or condition. Treated subjects may then be exposed to a corresponding agent causative of that secondary infection or condition, and assessed for the presence or absence of infection and/or the presence or absence of symptoms associated with the particular secondary infection or condition over a suitable time period. Comparison of symptoms with suitable control subject(s) allows determination of whether immunity to the secondary infection or condition in treated subject(s) is enhanced by the administered composition.<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --></p>
<p id="p0251" num="0251">As demonstrated in the experimental data provided herein (see "Examples" section below), gamma-irradiated influenza viruses induce cross-protective immunity against flu infection (i.e. immunity against heterologous flu strains). Moreover, gamma-irradiated influenza viruses of the present disclosure can enhance immune responses (e.g. adaptive immune responses) induced by co-administered immunogens and vaccines. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the disclosure relate to the use of gamma-irradiated influenza viruses as agents for preventing and/or treating secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection. Without limitation to particular mechanism(s) of action, it is thought that changes imposed on the immune status of the subject, in combination with cross-reactive immunity against influenza viruses invoked by administration of gamma-irradiated influenza, provide a means of protecting a recipient against the secondary infections and conditions. Furthermore, the changes imposed on the immune status of the influenza-infected subject are believed to reduce the propensity to develop strong TH2 responses upon subsequent exposure to allergens (e.g. respiratory allergens) thereby protecting against the development secondary allergic conditions. It has also been identified that gamma-irradiated influenza viruses enhance immune responses induced by co-administered immunogens/vaccines targeted against diseases and conditions that occur independently of influenza infection.</p>
<p id="p0252" num="0252">Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods for enhancing the immune response against secondary infections or conditions associated with influenza infection by administering a therapeutically effective amount of gamma-irradiated influenza viruses to a subject. The secondary infection or condition referred to in the embodiments above may arise within 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, or 42 days of an influenza infection. The gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered to the subject prior to developing the secondary infection or condition (i.e. as a prophylactic treatment). In such a case the vaccine may be administered before and/or after influenza infection occurs. Additionally or alternatively, the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered after the secondary infection or condition arises (i.e. as a therapeutic treatment). It will also be understood that the methods may comprise administering a mixture of different gamma-irradiated influenza types, subtypes and/or strains to the subject.

<p id="p0253" num="0253">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods for enhancing the immune response against an agent causative of a disease or condition. The methods of the<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> present disclosure may enhance the immune response to any particular immunogen. The immunogen may induce an immune response against a microorganism (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites) and/or allergen. Non-limiting examples of applicable microorganisms are set out above in the subsection entitled <i>"Immunogens".</i></p>
<p id="p0254" num="0254">In some embodiments, the immune response may be enhanced by inducing stronger interferon (IFN) type I responses (e.g. IFN-α) against the agent causative of a disease or condition.</p>
<p id="p0255" num="0255">Additionally or alternatively, the immune response may be enhanced by inducing stronger antigen-specific antibody responses (e.g. antigen specific IgG responses) against the agent causative of a disease or condition.</p>
<p id="p0256" num="0256">In certain embodiments, the immune response may be enhanced against a viral infection. Non-limiting examples of suitable viruses that the co-administered vaccine may target include adenoviruses, coronaviruses, coxsackieviruses, cytomegaloviruses, echoviruses, Epstein-Barr viruses, herpes simplex viruses, influenza viruses, measles viruses, myxoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, rhinoviruses, togaviruses (e.g. semliki forest virus) and Varicella-Zoster viruses.</p>

<p id="p0258" num="0258">Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods for enhancing immune responses induced by vaccines against agent(s) causative of secondary infection(s) and condition(s) associated with influenza infection. The methods comprise administering gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and at least one type of immunogen against an agent causative of the secondary infection or condition. The secondary infection or condition referred to in the embodiments above may arise within 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, or 42 days of an influenza infection. The gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered to a subject simultaneously with the immunogen, prior to administering the immunogen, or after administering the immunogen. The gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and/or immunogen(s) may be administered to a subject in the form of a composition or vaccine of the present disclosure. It will also be understood that the method may comprise administering a mixture of different gamma-irradiated influenza types, subtypes and/or strains, and/or a mixture of immunogens against different agents to the subject.</p>
<p id="p0259" num="0259">Further embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods for preventing and/or treating secondary infections or conditions arising after influenza virus infection,<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> the methods comprising administering to a subject a synergistic combination of a gamma-irradiated influenza virus and an immunogen from an agent causative of the secondary infection or condition. The secondary infection or condition referred to in the embodiments above may arise within 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, or 42 days of an influenza infection. The gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and immunogens may be administered to a subject in the form of a composition or vaccine of the present disclosure. It will be understood that the method may comprise administering a mixture of different gamma-irradiated influenza types, subtypes and/or strains, and/or a mixture of immunogens against different agents to the subject.</p>
<p id="p0260" num="0260">As discussed above (see subsection entitled <i>"Synergistic combinations"</i>) the present disclosure provides a synergistic combination comprising at least one gamma-irradiated influenza virus strain and at least one additional immunogen against a secondary infection or condition associated with influenza infection (i.e. at least one "immunogen against a secondary agent"). In accordance with the methods of the present disclosure, a synergistic combination of the present disclosure may be administered to a subject to induce immunity against both the influenza virus and at least one other agent causative of an associated secondary infection or condition. In general, the immunogenicity induced against a secondary infection or condition by the synergistic combination is greater than could be gained from the additive effect of each component when used independently of the other.</p>
<p id="p0261" num="0261">The methods of the present disclosure may be used to enhance the immune response of a subject against secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection. Accordingly, the methods of the present disclosure may be used to prevent and/or treat secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection. Non-limiting examples of secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection and causative agents are provided in the subsection above entitled <i>"Immunogens".</i></p>
<p id="p0262" num="0262">In certain embodiments, methods of the present disclosure are used to enhance and/or modulate the immune response of a subject against a secondary condition associated with influenza infection (e.g. an allergy). For example, the methods of the disclosure may be used to modulate the immune status of a subject infected by influenza virus such that hypersensitivity (e.g. type I hypersensitivity) to allergens is reduced (e.g. respiratory allergens such as, for example, pollen, mould, house dust mite <i>(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus),</i> dust, protein allergens from animals, chemical allergens, and combinations thereof).<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --></p>
<p id="p0263" num="0263">Gamma-irradiated influenza viruses administered in accordance with the methods of the present disclosure may be of any type, subtype or strain, or a mixture of any number of different types, subtypes and/or strains. Non-limiting examples of suitable influenza types, subtypes and strains along with methods for gamma-irradiation of the viruses are provided in the preceding subsection entitled <i>"Gamma-irradiated influenza viruses".</i></p>
<p id="p0264" num="0264">In certain embodiments, gamma-irradiated viruses administered in accordance with the methods of the present disclosure are H1N1 subtype viruses. The H1N1 viruses may be strain APR/8/34.</p>
<p id="p0265" num="0265">Immunogens against agent(s) causative of secondary infection(s) or condition(s) associated with influenza infection to be administered in accordance with the methods of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, any one or more of those provided in the preceding subsection entitled <i>"Immunogens".</i> Non-limiting examples of agents which the immunogens induce immunity against are also provided in the preceding subsection entitled <i>"Immunogens".</i></p>
<p id="p0266" num="0266">Non-limiting examples of secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection that may be treated and/or prevented using the methods of the present disclosure are also provided in the subsection above entitled <i>"Immunogens".</i> Accordingly, non-limiting examples of secondary infections and conditions that may be prevented or treated include pneumonia (e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal pneumonia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis and the common cold.</p>
<p id="p0267" num="0267">"Subjects" and "recipients" as contemplated herein include mammals (e.g. humans) and individuals of any species of social, economic or research importance including, but not limited to, ovine, bovine, equine, porcine, feline, canine, avian, primate, and rodent species. The subject or receipient may be mammalian. The subject or receipient may be human. In certain embodiments, the subject may be avian (e.g. chicken/<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>).</p>
<p id="p0268" num="0268">Gamma-irradiated influenza virus, immunogens against secondary agents casusative of infections or conditions associated with influenza infection, and compositions and vaccines of the present disclosure may be administered to a subject by the mucosal route (e.g. the intranasal route). Mucosal and intranasal compositions and methods for administering the same are described in the subsections above entitled <i>"Pharmaceutical compositions"</i> and <i>Vaccines".</i></p>
<p id="p0269" num="0269">Administration via the intranasal route, and in particular gamma-irradiated microorganisms by the intranasal route may provide advantages over other routes of<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> administration. For example, administration by the intranasal route is thought to induce secretory IgA production at mucosal epithelium eliciting cross protection more effectively than serum IgG. Without being bound to a particular mechanism, inactivation of influenza virus and/or other secondary infectious agents by gamma-irradiation is believed to cause inactivation without significantly affecting the antigenic structure of the microorganism. Thus, the combination of gamma-irradiation of microorganisms followed by intranasal administration is thought to offers several advantages, including, but not limited to, 1) facilitating the binding of inactivated microorganism to tissue specific receptors, 2) allowing the induction of tissue specific immune responses, 3) reducing the systemic exposure to whole mircroorganism antigen, and 4) limiting the side effects associated with whole mircroorganism vaccines.</p>
<p id="p0270" num="0270">In addition, a number of secondary infections and conditions associated with influenza infection affect the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts. For example, many causative agents induce pneumonia (e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal pneumonia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis or the common cold. Accordingly, administration of compositions of the disclosure via mucosal routes and in particular via the intranasal route provides localised stimulation of the immune response in tissues affected by relevant pathogens and allergens.</p>
<p id="p0271" num="0271">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to co-administering gamma-irradiated influenza viruses with an additional immunogen (or vaccine comprising an additional immunogen) for the purpose of enhancing immune responses induced by the additional immunogen/vaccine. This provides a means of preventing and/or treating various diseases and conditions, including secondary infections associated with influenza infection.</p>
<p id="p0272" num="0272">It will be understood that "co-administering" in this context encompasses both simultaneous and sequential administration of the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and additional immunogen/vaccine at the same site or at a different site. Accordingly, the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and additional immunogen/vaccine may be administered together as a single formulation, or, be administered as separate components.</p>
<p id="p0273" num="0273">The gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and additional immunogen/vaccine may be administered by the same or different modes of administration. By way of non-limiting example only, the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered intranasally while the additional immunogen/vaccine may be administered intravenously,<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. Alternatively, the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses and additional immunogen/vaccine may both be administered intranasally.</p>
<p id="p0274" num="0274">In embodiments where administration is sequential, the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered to the subject first and the immunogen/vaccine second, or <i>vice versa.</i> The order of administration of the additional immunogen/vaccine and the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be contemporaneous (i.e. sufficiently close in time so that the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses result in an enhancement of an immune response induced by the additional immunogen/vaccine). Contemporaneous administration encompasses administration of the gamma-irradiated influenza viruses up to about one week before or one week after administration of the immunogen/vaccine. For example, the immunogen/vaccine and gamma-irradiated influenza viruses may be administered to the subject on the same day or within several hours of each other.</p>

<p id="p0296" num="0296">Spleen cells of mice primed with infectious A/JAP virus (10<sup>3</sup> HAU) 3 months previously were boosted <i>in vitro</i> with A/JAP treated stimulator cells, using either infectious virus, γ-irradiated or UV-inactivated virus and Tc cell activity assays were carried out. The results shown in <b>Table 2</b> demonstrate that all three viruses were able to restimulate cross-reactive Tc memory cells, but that γ-irradiated virus was superior to UV-irradiated virus.

<p id="p0298" num="0298">To investigate whether mice immunized with such inactivated virus preparations would be protected against lethal influenza virus infections, mice were primed with infectious, γ-irradiated or UV-irradiated A/JAP virus 4-5 weeks prior to a challenge with a lethal dose of live influenza virus of the same or different subtypes. The results from one of two experiments are shown in <b>Table 4.</b> Mice primed with any of the three viruses survived a challenge by the homologous A/JAP and heterologous A/WSN virus, though mice primed with UV-irradiated virus and challenged with A/WSN sickened and one died. The major difference observed was with A/PC virus. Mice primed with UV-irradiated virus were as susceptible as unprimed animals, whereas mice primed with γ-irradiated virus survived the challenge at least as well as mice primed with infectious virus. It is unlikely that antibody was responsible for the observed cross-protection, as<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> transfer of immune serum from animals primed with either infectious or γ-inactivated virus significantly reduced virus titres in the lungs of animals infected with the homologous A/JAP virus but not in A/WSN-infected animals.

<p id="p0299" num="0299">These results demonstrate that γ-inactivated virus protects animals against lethal infection by heterologous A strain viruses at least as well as infectious virus. UV-inactivated virus on the other hand did not confer this protection to the more distantly related virus A/PC (H3N2). The finding that γ-irradiation is more effective than UV-irradiation in retaining the ability to prime for cross-reactive Tc cells upon destroying viral infectivity suggests that γ-irradiation is less damaging to the antigenic structure of at least some internal proteins than is UV irradiation. Surprisingly, there is little previously published work on the affect of γ-irradiation on viruses or proteins. In contrast to infectious virus, neither the γ-irradiated or UV-irradiated virus was able to sensitize target cells (activated macrophages, lymphoblasts or P815 cells) facilitating lysis by virus-specific Tc cells. However, it is possible that the cells which are mainly involved in antigen presentation of irradiated virus after intravenous injection may have characteristics different from those of activated macrophages or lymphocytes.</p>

<p id="p0337" num="0337"><figref idref="f0008"><b>Figure 10</b></figref> illustrates that passive serum transfer fails to transfer heterosubtypic immunity induced by γ-irradiated A/PC, to naive mice.

Recipient mice (9∼10 mice per group) were given intravenously 0.2 ml of immune sera or preimmune sera as a control. At two hours post serum transfer, mice were challenged intranasally with A/PR8 (7 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss <b>(</b><figref idref="f0008"><b>Figure 10</b></figref> <b>A, B &amp; C)</b> and mortality (<b>Figure 10D</b>). Naive mice that received γ-irradiated A/PC immune serum developed clinical signs and weight loss similarly to those that received pre-immune serum (Figure 10A, C &amp; D). These mice rapidly lost weight to reach the endpoint of 25% weight loss and accordingly were not protected from heterosubtypic challenge. In contrast, mice that received the hyper-immune serum were fully protected with virtually no weight loss when challenged with homologousA/PR8 (7 x 10<sup>1</sup> PFU) (Figure 10B &amp; D). These data indicate that γ-irradiated A/PC induced antibodies are not cross-protective.</p>
<p id="p0338" num="0338">Secondly, B cell-deficient µMT<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used to assess the role of B cells in cross-protective immunity. 10-week-old µMT<sup>-/-</sup> mice were immunized intranasally with γ-irradiated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent) and challenged with the heterosubtypic strain A/PR8 (7 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU) three weeks post-immunization.

The vaccinated µMT<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a survival rate similar to that of naive mice <b>(</b><figref idref="f0009"><b>Figure 11A</b></figref><b>, B &amp; C)</b>, implying that an absence of B cells does impair the development of cross-protective immunity. Furthermore, intranasal vaccination with γ-irradiated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent) failed to protect MHC-II<sup>-/-</sup><!-- EPO <DP n="71"> --> mice against heterosubtypic challenge with A/PR8 <b>(</b><figref idref="f0010"><b>Figure 12A</b></figref><b>, B &amp; C).</b> MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> mice were immunized intranasally with γ-irradiated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent). 3 weeks post- immunization, naive and immunized mice (9∼10 mice per group) were challenged with heterosubtypic strain A/PR8 (7 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and mortality for 20 days. Vaccination with γ-irradiated A/PC failed to protect NMC-II<sup>-/-</sup> mice against heterosubtypic challenge with A/PR8.

<p id="p0339" num="0339">β2M<sup>-/-</sup> mice which are deficient in CD8+ Tc cell responses were used to evaluate the contribution of CD8+ T (Tc) cells in the cross-protective immunity induced by intranasal immunisation with γ-irradiated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent). A heterosubtypic challenge with A/PR8 (7 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU) caused a mortality rate of 60%, with the surviving mice losing over 10% of their body weight prior to their recovery <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 13B &amp; C</b></figref><b>).</b> Controls, unvaccinated mice infected with the same virus strain suffered 100% mortality <b>(</b><figref idref="f0011"><b>Figure 13A &amp; C</b></figref>).

<p id="p0340" num="0340">Although these results show a role for B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the cross-protective immunity against influenza, defective primary immune responses in the knock-out mice may obscure the cross-protective potential of both humoral and cellular memory responses. As an alternative approach to assess the nature of the effector cells, an adoptive transfer model was used, with splenocytes from 3 week earlier intravenously γ-irradiated A/PC (1 x 10<sup>8</sup> PFU equivalent) immunized mice as donor cells. Splenocytes were nylon wool-enriched T cells (82.8% T cells, 7.9% B cell) or B cells (84.2% B cells, 8.3% T cells) and intravenously transferred into naive mice. Three hour post-transfer mice were challenged with 0.1 x LD50 A/PR8 (7 x 10 PFU). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and mortality for 20 days. T cell recipients were partially protected against A/PR8 challenge <b>(</b><figref idref="f0012"><b>Figure 14A</b></figref><b>, B &amp; D).</b> In contrast, no protection was observed in B cell recipient mice, which developed disease symptoms similar to that of controls (unvaccinated with no lymphocyte transfer) following A/PR8 challenge <b>(</b><figref idref="f0012"><b>Figure 14A</b></figref><b>, C &amp; D).</b> These adoptive transfer studies further support a critical role for T cells, but not B cells, in cross protective immunity against A/PR8 challenges.</p>
<p id="p0341" num="0341">CD8+ T cells exert antiviral effects by either directly killing virus-infected cells or secreting cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF.

Viral neutralizing activities against A/PC (H3N2) or A/PR8 (H1N1) were determined by plaque reduction assays for sera collected 3 weeks after immunization with live, γ-irradiated, formalin or UV-inactivated A/PC. After heat inactivation of serum samples at 56°C for 30 minutes, 190 µl of serially diluted (x10, x30, x90, x270) sera were mixed with 10µl virus suspension containing roughly 1 x10<sup>2</sup> PFU.

<heading id="h0077">(iii) Discussion</heading>
<p id="p0345" num="0345">As noted in the Examples above, γ-ray inactivated influenza A virus, especially when administered intranasally, confers robust protection against lethal homologous and heterosubtypic virus challenges, including the virulent avian H5N1 strain. These data demonstrate that cross-reactive cellular immunity mediated predominantly by Tc cells, and not humoral immunity, is the essential element responsible for the cross protective immunity induced by γ-irradiated influenza virus. This conclusion is based on several independent lines of evidence: 1) β2M<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not generate cross protective immune<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> responses; 2) transfer of enriched T cells, but not of B cells or immune sera, from γ-inactivated influenza immune donor mice conferred cross reactive immunity to naive recipients; and 3) cross-protective immunity induced by the preparation was dependent on the essential cytolytic effector molecule perforin.</p>
<p id="p0346" num="0346">The latter observation, together with the induction of cross-protective immunity induced in IFN<sup>-</sup>IIR<sup>-/-</sup> mice strongly suggests that cytolytic Tc cells provide protection through killing of virus-infected cells via their granule-exocytosis pathway of cytotoxicity, and not by CD8 + T cell IFN-γ-mediated virus control. Consistent with the above, immunization with γ-irradiated influenza virus can elicit similar T cell responses to that induced by live virus. This cross reactive T cell potential persists for at least 3 months and led to a stronger secondary Tc response upon <i>in vivo</i> re-immunization. This correlates with the observation that mice immunised with γ-irradiated influenza virus are well protected against heterosubtypic challenge for at least 3 months. However, the immunization with a homologous strain did not enhance the secondary Tc response. This observation suggests that the primary immunization elicited highly strain specific antibody responses which neutralized the secondary challenge with the homologous virus, thus preventing memory Tc cell activation.</p>
<p id="p0347" num="0347">Induction of cross-reactive Tc cell responses was highly dose dependent on γ-irradiated virus in contrast to replicative live virus. With Tc cells identified as the dominant factor in providing heterosubtypic protection, there was still some evidence of a contribution by B cells to this protective response, since µMT<sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed increased susceptibility to heterosubtypic challenge. The absence of cross-neutralizing antibody responses in serum as well as a lack of protective effect of transferred serum suggests that the contribution of B cells is independent of their principle soluble product, antibody. In certain circumstances, Naive B cells are thought to be capable to restore immunity in µMT<sup>-/-</sup> mice against secondary infections in an antibody-independent manner. In addition, B cells may have a role in promoting effector Tc cell function. Hence, the possible role of cross protective antibodies cannot be neglected and mucosal cross-neutralizing antibodies may also be contributing to heterosubytpic immunity. The observed partial cross protection, although not statistically significant, in β2M<sup>-/-</sup> and prf<sup>-/-</sup> mice supports this notion. Moreover, passive immunity obtained by adoptive T cell transfer was only partially successful in protecting against a sublethal dose of virulent A/PR8. Thus, both antibodies as well as Tc cells may ultimately contribute to optimal cross-protection.<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --></p>

<p id="p0359" num="0359">The protective efficacy of γ-irradiated, formalin-, or UV inactivated influenza virus preparations against homo- and heterosubtypic live virus challenges was compared. Groups of 9-10 BALB/c mice were mock treated or immunized intranasally either with formalin-, UV- or γ-ray inactivated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent) and at week 3 after the immunization, naive and immunized mice (9∼10 mice per group) were intranasally infected with A/PC (MLD50; 3.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) or A/PR8 (MLD50; 7.0 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU). Survival of infected mice was monitored daily for 20 days. As shown in <figref idref="f0018 f0019"><b>Figure 20</b></figref> <b>A, E, F &amp; J,</b> intranasal infection of naive mice with A/PC or A/PR8 caused a rapid weight loss with 90-100% mortality (based on 25% weight loss as an end point).

<p id="p0360" num="0360">γ-ray inactivated A/PC was clearly more effective after only one intranasal dose than multiple intranasal administrations of formalin-inactivated preparations. It was then determined whether the weak protective efficacy of formalin-inactivated A/PC could be improved by testing different immunization schedules. Groups of 9-10 BALB/c mice were mock treated or immunized either once, twice or three times with formalin-inactivated A/PC (9.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent or HAU dose equivalent to that of γ-ray inactivated A/PC; 2300 HAU). Mock treated or single dose immunized mice were challenged with A/PC (MLD50; 3.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) at three weeks post immunization. Double or triple dose immunized mice were intranasally infected with A/PC (MLD50; 3.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) or A/PR8 (MLD50; 7 x 10<sup>2</sup> PFU) one week after the final immunization. Survival of infected mice were monitored daily for 20 days. The group of mice that received a single immunization had no improved survival rate compared to that of unvaccinated mice <b>(</b><figref idref="f0020"><b>Figure 21A</b></figref><b>, B &amp; E).</b> In contrast, double immunization improved the survival rate to 60% (P &lt; 0.05) although the majority of mice still showed a significant loss in bodyweight, indicating that they experienced severe illness <b>(</b><figref idref="f0020"><b>Figure 21C</b></figref><figref idref="f0021"> <b>&amp; E</b></figref><b>).</b> The mice receiving triple immunization with formalin-inactivated A/PC showed complete protection with no mortality and little weight loss <b>(</b><figref idref="f0020"><b>Figure 21D</b></figref><figref idref="f0021"> <b>&amp; E</b></figref><b>).</b> Triple immunization conferred partial protection from heterosubtypic challenge (P &lt; 0.05) <b>(</b><figref idref="f0021"><b>Figure 21F</b></figref><b>, G &amp; H).</b> Thus, formalin-inactivated A/PC requires more doses and fails to elicit the cross-protection suggesting that the induced immunity is not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively, substantially inferior to that induced by γ-ray inactivated A/PC.</p>

<p id="p0370" num="0370">Accordingly, gamma-irradiated influenza virus is on an equivalent virus dose basis at least 30-100 times more efficient than the commercially available flu vaccine and is superior in quality to the present commercially available flu vaccine.</p>
<heading id="h0101">(iii) Discussion</heading>
<p id="p0371" num="0371">The present study evaluated in a comparative setting the protective efficacy of three types of inactivation regimens; γ-irradiation, and formalin-, or UV- inactivation, to assess whether the currently used chemical inactivation method, used since 1945, is the most suitable choice for influenza vaccine preparation. It was shown that γ-ray inactivated A/PC (3.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent, 2300 HAU) had superior immunogenicity compared to the other sterilization methods, and confers a high level of protection against both homologous and heterosubtypic challenges. This superior protection was reflected in 100% survival and lower weight loss, which correlated with histological evaluations of lung tissues after infection as well as reduced lung viral load compared to naive and formalin- or UV- inactivated-virus vaccinated mice. Similarly, single doses of a currently used trivalent influenza vaccine provided no protection against A/PC or A/PR8 challenges.</p>
<p id="p0372" num="0372">Three-fold higher doses of formalin-inactivated A/PC (9.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU equivalent, 2300 HAU) and multiple immunizations were required to gain the level of protection afforded by γ-ray inactivated A/PC. Furthermore, formalin-inactivated A/PC conferred protection only against homologous (and not against heterosubtypic) virus challenge. Therefore, an increase in dose and frequency of immunization only improves the strain-specific immunity of formalin-inactivated virus. It is important to note that for per virus particle inactivated, γ-ray inactivated virus is more immunogenic than formalin-inactivated virus since a formalin-inactivated virus preparation required three times more PFU for a comparable HAU dose and triple immunizations, as opposed to single priming for γ-irradiated A/PC, to obtain strain specific immunity. These findings demonstrate that γ- ray inactivation maintains superior antigenicity and immunogenicity relative to the other procedures. Thus γ-ray inactivated virus could induce immunity that is not only<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --> quantitatively but also qualitatively superior to virus preparations inactivated by formalin treatment or UV-irradiation.</p>
<p id="p0373" num="0373">In the event of a pandemic, a single dose regimen, as promised by γ-irradiated virus, would be incomparably more desirable than a multiple, high dose, formalin-inactivated influenza vaccine immunization regimens which also require adjuvants. Moreover, the fact that no adjuvants are required for γ-ray inactivated influenza suggests that reactogenicity problems are less likely to be encountered. Alum is most commonly used adjuvant for human vaccines but it has been proven to be ineffective in enhancing the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine antigens. In addition, alum skews the immune response towards T helper (Th) type 2-supported humoral immune responses which may reduce the effectiveness of γ-ray inactivated virus, as the latter is known to induce Th1-type cellular immune responses, including Tc cell responses that correlate with heterosubtypic protection. Furthermore the efficacy of γ-irradiated influenza virus is highlighted by the fact that after a single dose of intranasal priming, the immunized mice were able to resist heterosubtypic challenge doses of up to 50 x LD50, for a period of up to 3 months, underscoring the robust immunity induced.</p>
<p id="p0374" num="0374">It is speculated that the cross protection induced by γ-irradiated virus is mediated by mucosal Tc cell responses. An alternative hypothesis is induction of cross-reactive secretory IgA antibodies to internal viral proteins. Some secretory IgA antibodies are capable of intracellular neutralization of influenza virus during transcytosis into the infected epithelial cells, and the present data suggests that cross-reactive Tc cells may be responsible for the cross protection observed here as other forms of inactivated influenza viruses, are unable to prime for influenza-immune Tc cell responses. Moreover, gamma-ray inactivation has less impact on hemagglutination activity than formalin or UV inactivation. γ-irradiated virus, retaining antigens similar to their native forms does appear to at least partially account for its superior immunogenicity. Intranasal administration targets the lung mucosa associated lymphoid organ for inducing immunity in the respiratory tract. However, a previously marketed intranasally administered influenza vaccine, was associated with an increase in the number of Bell's palsy cases - facial paralysis (see <nplcit id="ncit0058" npl-type="s"><text>Mutsch, et al., (2004), "Use of the inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine and the risk of Bell's palsy in Switzerland", The New England journal of medicine, 350: 896-903</text></nplcit>) and consequently resulted in market withdrawal of this vaccine preparation. This adverse event has been attributed to the mucosal adjuvant used; <i>Escherichia coli</i> heat-labile toxin. Such safety concern would not be an issue with γ-ray inactivated<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --> influenza vaccine as it does not require the inclusion of potentially harmful adjuvants in its vaccine formulation.</p>
<p id="p0375" num="0375">Apart from the strong protective efficacy observed, several additional factors contribute to the attractiveness of γ-irradiation for influenza vaccines. Firstly, freeze dried γ-ray inactivated A/PC maintained its cross-protective property. Dry powder formulations will improve stability compared to liquid formulations under various storage conditions providing a significant advantage in distribution of the vaccine in an event of a pandemic. Secondly, the intranasal route of delivery, which requires little training or medical qualified personnel, would provide additional advantages for developing countries. Thirdly, γ-ray inactivated influenza vaccine would be comparatively easy and inexpensive to manufacture when compared to other vaccine production processes. Most importantly with regards to manufacturing considerations and availability, the robust heterosubtypic protection induced by γ-ray inactivated influenza may render annual reformulation of influenza vaccines obsolete.</p>
<heading id="h0102"><b>Example 6: Preparation of influenza virus for gamma-irradiation</b></heading>
<p id="p0376" num="0376">Viruses used in current influenza vaccines are generally purified before attenuation using ultracentrifugation which has been associated with loss of viral-antigen and/or destruction of virion structure. The induction of cytotoxic T cell responses by γ-irradiated influenza vaccines will benefit from an alternative method of virus purification (differential/tangential filtration) prior to γ-irradiation which preserves the integrity of virion structure.</p>
<p id="p0377" num="0377">It is envisaged that virus stocks will be clarified using centrifugation at low speed (∼3000rpm) and used in size exclusion based centrifugation. Clarified stocks will be spun through filtering device with pore size 50-80nm. In general, the size of influenza virus will be 80-120nm. Thus, variable pore size (e.g less than 80nm) will be used to purify influenza virus at low centrifugation speeds (4000 -10000 rpm) (variable speed can be used) at 4°C for as long as needed to get liquid through the filter. The initial virus stock liquid flow path on the upstream side of the filter will be tangential or across the filter surface. Upon centrifugation, the majority of the liquid will pass through the filter (permeate), while a small portion will be retained in the central reservoir as the retentate (containing all the virus).</p>
<p id="p0378" num="0378">The retentate will be rediluted with PBS (normal saline, or any other media) that may contain sugar (dextran, sucrose) to maintain the osmotic pressure and consequently virus integrity. These diluted preparations may be filtered again, if needed. Concentrated<!-- EPO <DP n="86"> --> virus from the final centrifugation step will be treated by γ-irradiation as described in the Examples above. Free radical scavengers, such as Ascorbate, can be added to purified virus stocks prior to irradiation to reduce possible damage to viral proteins while inactivating viral genome during γ-irradiation.</p>
<p id="p0379" num="0379">For example, the following protocol may be utilised for the purification of intact influenza virus to be used for γ-irradiation:
<ol id="ol0006" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>1. influenza virus stock can be harvested from embryonated eggs, or <i>in vitro</i> tissue culture.</li>
<li>2. using filter devices with a cut off of 300 Kd, virus stock can be clarified by centrifuging at 300g for 30 minutes at 4°C causing both influenza viruses and proteins of the allentoic fluids (or tissue culture media) to pass through the filter.</li>
<li>3. using filter devices with a cut off of 100 Kd, clarified virus stock can be purified by centrifuging at 300g for 30 minutes at 4°C. In this step influenza viruses do not pass through the filter (thereby concentrating the virus) on one side of the filter.</li>
<li>4. concentrated virus can be washed with normal saline (or any buffered media) to remove any remaining egg proteins (washing may be performed as many times as required). Washing can be performed by diluting the concentrated viruses with saline and centrifuging as described in step 3 above.</li>
<li>5. the final virus concentrate will contain intact virion.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0380" num="0380">In general, pore size cut off levels for filtering devices used in the above technique can be designed to match virion size of 80-120 nm. All procedures may be conducted at 4°C and no ultracentrifugation is required. Viral infectivity can be tested for original stock and final products. Prior knowledge of virus titres and volume can facilitate estimation of level of concentration. The purity of the final product can be determined using standard biochemical analyses.</p>

To confirm these differences, WT B6 mice were injected i.v with either live viruses SFV(10<sup>7</sup>) or FLU(10<sup>7</sup>) or their gamma irradiated forms γ-SFV(10<sup>8</sup>) or γ-FLU(10<sup>7</sup>). 24 hours post injection, splenocytes were analysed for cell surface expression of CD69 and CD86 using FACS. Anti-CD3 and B220 cells were used to gate on T and B lymphocytes respectively. Splenocytes from naive mice were used as the negative control.

<heading id="h0124">(iii) Discussion</heading>
<heading id="h0125"><i>Differences in the induction of IFN-I among gamma irradiated viruses</i></heading>
<p id="p0408" num="0408">The major focus of the study was to exploit the IFN-I responses by γ-FLU and analyse how this could benefit immunity towards additional vaccines. The first aim of the study was to confirm the differences between γ-FLU and γ-SFV in terms of their ability to induce IFN-I responses and the associated partial lymphocyte activation. This was very important in defining the advantage of using γ-SFV as the experimental vaccine model. SFV and Influenza are both single-stranded RNA viruses which are capable of inducing strong IFN-I responses and partial lymphocyte activation within the first 24 hours of infection, as confirmed by upregulation of CD69 and CD86 on lymphocytes <b>(</b><figref idref="f0031"><b>Figure 30</b></figref><b>).</b> The potent induction of IFN-α induced by SFV as opposed to live infection with FLU has could be explained by the nature of their infection strategies. Importantly, this study has identified some interesting differences among the live and gamma-irradiated forms of these viruses. γ-SFV is unable to induce IFN-α and fails to induce partial lymphocyte activation as observed by the absence of CD69 and CD86 upregulation <b>(</b><figref idref="f0031"><b>Figures 30</b></figref> <b>and</b> <figref idref="f0032"><b>31</b></figref><b>).</b> This contrasts to γ-FLU which elicits a strong IFN-α response and induces partial systemic lymphocyte activation analogous to its live form.</p>
<heading id="h0126"><i>Antibody responses induced by γ-SFV</i></heading>
<p id="p0409" num="0409">Given the lack of primary T cell responses induced during the course of live SFV infection in B6 mice, and therefore the dependence on antibody responses to prevent viral dissemination throughout the host, the quality of antibody responses generated by γ-SFV were investigated to establish the vaccine experimental model. Initially it was confirmed that the absence of systemic IFN-I responses shown in <figref idref="f0031"><b>Figures 30</b></figref> <b>and</b> <figref idref="f0032"><b>31</b></figref> does not hinder the ability of the vaccine to mount effective antibody responses. Plaque assay testing<!-- EPO <DP n="97"> --> viremia at day 1 post SFV infection confirmed that prior vaccination with γ-SFV induced effective and protective antibody responses illustrated by the lack of detectable infectious particles in the serum upon challenge with live SFV <b>(</b><figref idref="f0033"><b>Figure 32</b></figref><b>).</b> The high IgG levels in the serum of γ-SFV vaccinated animals <b>(</b><figref idref="f0033"><b>Figure 33</b></figref><b>)</b> further highlights the efficacy of pre-existing antibody induced by vaccination, in neutralising the virus from the blood circulation upon secondary challenge. In addition, the level of SFV-specific antibody responses induced by γ-SFV is dose dependent. Therefore, γ-SFV(10<sup>7</sup>) was selected as the appropriate dose for co-administration with γ-FLU as it was still able to induce significantly higher antibody responses in comparison to the minimal levels induced by a γ-SFV(10<sup>6</sup>), but significantly lower levels than those induced by γ-SFV(10<sup>8</sup>). This provided flexibility to test suppression or enhancement of antibody responses upon co-administration with γ-FLU.</p>
<heading id="h0127"><i>The effect of γ-FLU and</i> γ<i>-SFV co-administration on SFV-specific antibody responses</i></heading>
<p id="p0410" num="0410">γ-FLU vaccines generate cross protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses upon homologous and heterosubtypic influenza virus challenges, as well as eliciting protective antibody responses. Therefore, γ-FLU is considered as a potential universal influenza vaccine. Based on the potent IFN-I mediated immunostimulatory effects of γ-FLU, it was hypothesized that the IFN-I-mediated activity induced by γ-FLU may serve as an efficient adjuvant to enhance antibody responses towards a less immunogenic antigen such as γ-SFV.</p>
<p id="p0411" num="0411">One of the major reasons to incorporate adjuvants into vaccine preparations is to amplify the immunological responses generated towards the antigen of interest. Thus, to determine whether γ-FLU can be used as a potential adjuvant within vaccine preparations, serial doses of γ-FLU were combined with γ-SFV(10<sup>7</sup>) and mean antibody titres were measured to quantify any differences among the experimental groups. The data revealed that co-administration of γ-SFV with γ-FLU(10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup>) were effective in enhancing SFV-specific antibody responses in comparison to mice injected with γ-SFV alone <b>(</b><figref idref="f0034"><b>Figure 34</b></figref><b>).</b> The observed trend was also consistent over a time course following co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV <b>(</b><figref idref="f0034"><b>Figure 35</b></figref><b>).</b> Adjuvants are often used to achieve qualitative alterations within immunity such as increasing the speed of an immunological response and this is important especially at crucial times where a pandemic outbreak of infection could occur. Interestingly, the enhanced titres observed at day 6 post vaccination with co-injection of γ-FLU and γ-SFV were equal to the titres following vaccination at day 20 with γ-SFV<!-- EPO <DP n="98"> --> alone, therefore demonstrating that co- administration of γ-SFV and γ-FLU caused an earlier induction and an amplification of SFV humoral responses.</p>
<p id="p0412" num="0412">It is essential within any vaccine preparations that the immunity it elicits within the host is effective and adequate at providing protection. Based on the significant enhancement in SFV-specific IgG levels shown in <figref idref="f0034"><b>Figures 34 and 35</b></figref><b>,</b> antibody responses in the sera from mice co-injected with γ-FLU(10<sup>5</sup>) and γ-SFV were analysed for their neutralisation efficiency. The antibody responses in these mice were shown to be more proficient at neutralising SFV virions than injection of γ-SFV alone <b>(</b><figref idref="f0035"><b>Figure 36</b></figref><b>).</b> This effect is most likely due to an increase in antibody yield versus antibody affinity. Therefore, this confirmed that γ-FLU enhanced the quality and quantity of SFV-specific antibody responses.</p>
<heading id="h0128"><i>The effect of γ-FLU and</i> γ<i>-SFV co-administration on FLU-specific antibody responses</i></heading>
<p id="p0413" num="0413">It is important that using γ-FLU to enhance the immune response towards another immunogen in a co-administered vaccine does not compromise the immune response to γ-FLU. Therefore, humoral responses generated against FLU antigens were analysed to certify that immunological responses were not hindered when a second vaccine is present in the environment. The results show that co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV did not affect the titres of FLU-specific IgG <b>(</b><figref idref="f0035"><b>Figure 37</b></figref><b>)</b> in comparison to their corresponding individual doses of γ-FLU. In addition, co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV did not affect the neutralising activity of FLU-specific antibodies <b>(</b><figref idref="f0036"><b>Figure 38</b></figref><b>),</b> verifying that co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV did not compromise the vaccine efficacy of γ-FLU.</p>
<heading id="h0129">(iv) Conclusion</heading>
<p id="p0414" num="0414">These findings show that γ-FLU can be employed to increase the quality and magnitude of immune responses towards an alternative less immunogenic vaccine. The results demonstrate that co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV significantly enhanced protective, SFV-specific antibody responses towards a less immunogenic dose of γ-SFV, and resulted in an overall increase in the speed of the SFV-specific humoral response. Co-administration of γ-FLU and γ-SFV also did not affect the hosts' ability to generate appropriate humoral responses against the influenza virus. These findings provide evidence that γ-FLU, a safe and inexpensive vaccine, can be utilised to enhance immunity towards a co-administered vaccine that is otherwise less immunogenic in addition to providing protective immune responses against the influenza virus. Accordingly, co-administration<!-- EPO <DP n="99"> --> of γ-FLU with vaccines targeting secondary infections that commonly arise during or after an episode of influenza may serve to induce protective immune responses against the influenza virus and enhance the immunogenicity of the co-administered vaccine targeting the secondary infection.</p>
