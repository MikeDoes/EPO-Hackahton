<heading id="h0001"><u>Technical field</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to transmission via optical fibers in satellites and spacecraft and other high radiation environments.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>Background</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The Sun emits hazardous radiation in the form of SPEs (Solar Particle Events). These charged and highly energetic particles can interact with materials and cause: lattice deformation via ionization (both directly and indirectly); lattice deformation by direct collision; impurity creation in the lattice by neutron capture (neutrons produced in primary interactions); energy deposition which can lead to build up of charge, thus distorting the lattice. In addition to SPEs, there are also Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), energetic charged particles from Deep Space. These are less apparent because the solar activity deflects the GCR. Occasionally, the Sun emits a coronal mass ejection (CME) which is seen alongside a solar flare. CMEs release a much greater flux of SPEs and have been known to cause mission failure in satellites or spacecraft.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">On Earth, the magnetosphere provides protection from the harmful radiation from the Sun and Deep Space by deflecting the majority of high energy particles. In addition, the atmosphere attenuates the energetic particles that do pass through the magnetosphere. However, when in orbit around the Earth, this protection is diminished due to lack of atmosphere and weakening of the magnetosphere with distance from the Earth's core. It is particularly harmful to have the satellites orbiting within the radii of the Van Allen belts due to their nature as regions of trapped electrons and protons within the inner magnetosphere, between 60 and 6000 miles altitude for the inner belt and between 8,400 to 36,000miles for the outer belt. These radii vary with solar activity, so specific orbital tracks must be considered. Different elevation orbits have different associated dose rates, resulting in different total doses depending on the mission lifetime. A higher total dose is more harmful to both humans and equipment. It is also believed that a higher dose rate can have a more detrimental effect. In a geostationary orbit for 20 years, the expected total dose is 137Gy from behind 10mm thick aluminum shielding. In low earth orbit (LEO) the dose is less than half this value.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Both SPE and GCR lead to distortions in the lattice of a material and have specific effects on different types of materials. In optical materials, this can lead to defect creation via the previously mentioned processes in the fiber lattice structure. Not only is there creation of new defects, but intrinsic defects are also exacerbated. The radiation induced defects will absorb light, so that less light can propagate the fiber, resulting in so-called radiation induced attenuation (RIA). In order to keep the fiber as radiation tolerant as possible, it is therefore important to keep as perfect a lattice structure as possible.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">It has previously been reported that a full recovery from radiation damage to optical fibers can be found from pumping at both 980nm and 532nm. It is, however, not ideal in space to have multiple pumps since this requires more mass, power and adds another layer of complexity in reliability testing.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">It will be appreciated that the opportunities to repair or replace optical fibers located on satellites or spacecraft are very limited. Even if repair or replacement is possible, it is typically a very expensive process.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, given the use typical applications of optical fibers within satellites and/or spacecraft, any damage thereto could have very serious implications. For example, the optical fibers may be utilized within a spacecraft's navigation system, and hence any damage thereto may cause the spacecraft to take an incorrect path.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore essential to ensure that optical fibers used on satellites and spacecraft are optimally resistant to damage, particularly radiation damage.</p>

<heading id="h0003"><u>Definitions</u></heading>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">As used herein, "optical" includes all forms of electromagnetic radiation, whether visible or invisible to the human eye.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">As used herein, "extraterrestrial location" is any location outside of the Earth's atmosphere. Examples of extraterrestrial locations include a low earth orbit (LEO) such as that of the International Space Station (ISS), a medium earth orbit (MEO), a geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">As used herein, "high radiation environment" is an environment in which the average radiation dose is greater than approximately 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> Gy/h.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">As used herein, an "active dopant" is a dopant which, when optically pumped, absorbs the pump photons and uses the absorbed energy to amplify the seed or signal transmitted by the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">As used herein, a "passive dopant" is a dopant that, when pumped, does not substantially absorb the pump photons. A passive dopant may, however, modify the optical properties of the optical fiber through modifications of the structure thereof.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with the present invention, as seen from a first aspect, there is provided a spacecraft or satellite optical transmission apparatus in accordance with claim 1.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">It has been found by the applicant that an optical transmission system in accordance with the present invention demonstrates effective recovery from radiation induced attenuation (RIA). This is contrary to established thinking, which suggests that co-doping an active trivalent dopant with a passive trivalent dopant, particularly in high concentrations, produces an optical fiber with poor performance under radiation. Established thinking, in particular, suggests that co-doping an active trivalent dopant with aluminum produces an optical fiber that demonstrates greatly increased losses under high radiation conditions. It has been found by the applicant that optical pumping reverses this trend, which is believed to be due to the annealing of point defects associated with trivalent materials under such pumping.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The doping density of the passive trivalent dopants may be varied according to the doping density of the active trivalent dopant. Preferably the ratio of doping densities of passive trivalent dopants to active trivalent dopants is between approximately 20 and approximately 180 to 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The active trivalent dopant and passive trivalent dopants are preferably arranged in a trivalent matrix.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The optical fiber preferably comprises a single active trivalent dopant, but may comprise additional active trivalent dopants.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">In accordance with the invention the active trivalent dopant is erbium. As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, erbium is a trivalent material, but its concentration is fixed by the amount of absorption that is required of the fiber. Erbium constitutes the active component of the fiber, which absorbs the pump photons and uses that energy to amplify a signal carried by the fiber. The erbium doping concentration is therefore varied according to the absorption required for the particular application.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">Erbium is provided at a doping density of between approximately 100 parts per million (ppm) and approximately 3000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably the one or more passive trivalent dopants are selected from the group consisting of: lanthanum; aluminum; and phosphorus.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">As set out above co-doping with passive trivalent materials such as aluminium is thought to greatly increase radiation induced attenuation (RIA), which is undesirable. In the case without radiation induced attenuation though the addition of aluminium acts to improve the spectral gain flatness and increase the overall usable spectral bandwidth of a fiber in a fiber amplifier. The addition of aluminium is also beneficial for the incorporation of a higher concentration of erbium and reduces unwanted erbium ion clustering which can improve the amplifier efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">In accordance with the invention the two or more passive trivalent dopants comprise aluminum and lanthanum.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The passive trivalent dopants may comprise a member of the lanthanide series of chemical elements.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The passive trivalent dopants comprise lanthanum, which is provided at a dopant density between approximately 10,000 ppm and approximately 120,000 ppm. It has been found by the applicant that the presence of lanthanum in an optical fiber provides an improved recovery during anneal.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Additionally the passive trivalent dopants comprise trivalent aluminum, provided at a doping density of between approximately 10,000 ppm and 60,000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Additionally the passive trivalent dopants may comprise phosphorus, which may be provided at a doping density of up to approximately 20,000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The active trivalent dopants and the passive trivalent dopants are preferably disposed within a core of the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The optical fiber, preferably the core thereof, may comprise silica, which preferably defines a base material.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The optical fiber, preferably the core thereof, may comprise germanium. Preferably the optical fiber, and more preferably the core thereof, comprises germanosilicate, which preferably defines a base material.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The core of the optical fiber preferably comprises a diameter of between approximately 2 µm and approximately 20 µm. More preferably, the core of the optical fiber comprises a diameter of between approximately 2 µm and approximately 7 µm.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The optical fiber preferably comprises a cladding layer that circumferentially surrounds the core. Preferably the cladding layer comprises a diameter of between approximately 60 µm and approximately 200 µm. More preferably, the cladding layer comprises a diameter of between approximately 120 µm and approximately 130 µm. Preferably of the optical fiber comprises an outer dual coating of acrylate.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The apparatus is configured for optically pumping the optical fiber at a single wavelength only. In this regard, the apparatus comprises exactly one optical pump source configured for optically pumping at least a portion of the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">It has been found by the applicant that an optical fiber comprising a passive trivalent dopant shows excellent recovery under optical annealing at a single pump wavelength. The present invention therefore obviates the requirement for multiple pumps and consequently permits reduction in the mass and complexity of the optical transmission apparatus. It will be appreciated that mass budgeting is vital to any space mission; an estimate from 2004 provided in "<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>Spacecraft Systems Engineering" (Third Editi</text></nplcit>on) gives a cost of $25,000 per kilogram of mass launched into space. Preferably the optical pump source comprises a laser source.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The optical pump is configured to provide pump energy having a wavelength of between approximately 970 nm and approximately 990 nm. Whilst current space technology uses 1480 nm pumps, it has been found by the applicants that such pumps would not be particularly effective in annealing radiation induced damage.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">Advantageously the pumping of the optical fiber at around 980nm has been seen to reverse the trend of RIA in fibers containing trivalent materials such as aluminium or lanthanum. Also, it follows that the benefits of co-doping with these trivalent materials can now be achieved in high radiation environments. Therefore the fiber and apparatus described may provide superior gain flatness and maintain a wide spectral bandwidth in a high radiation environment for the lifetime of operation. This means that advantageously, the spectral performance of the fiber is maintained.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, the optical transmission apparatus comprises an optical amplifier.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">The optical amplifier may be included within a spacecraft or satellite data communications system, which may be arranged for internal or external communications.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">In one embodiment, the optical transmission apparatus defines part of a fiber optic gyroscope, which may constitute part of a navigation system of the spacecraft or satellite. The optical transmission apparatus preferably defines an optical source of the fiber optic gyroscope. In use, a pulse of radiation from the optical source, is split by an optical splitter, the two pulses being injected into a closed loop or closed series of loops of optical fiber in different directions. If the fiber optic gyroscope is subjected to rotation in the plane of the loop or loops, the beam travelling against the rotation experiences a marginally shorter path delay than the other beam.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In accordance with the present invention, also as seen from a first aspect, there is provided a spacecraft or satellite comprising an optical transmission apparatus as hereinbefore described.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">In accordance with the present invention, as seen from a second aspect, there is provided a method for transmitting electromagnetic radiation via an optical fiber in a high radiation environment, in accordance with claim 10.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">The high radiation environment may be an extraterrestrial environment, which includes but is not limited to a low earth orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), geostationary earth orbit (GEO) or geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the optical transmission apparatus 10 is in the form of an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) within a satellite communications system.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">The apparatus 10 comprises a first optical fiber 11 and second and third optical fibers 12, 13 at each longitudinal end of the first optical fiber 11.

<p id="p0058" num="0058">As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, erbium is an active trivalent dopant, whereas lanthanum and aluminum are passive trivalent dopants. The active trivalent dopant concentration, namely the erbium concentration, is fixed by the level of absorption required for the particular application but this is not the case for the passive trivalent dopants.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The second and third optical fibers 12, 13 are identical to one another, each comprising a central core and a surrounding cladding layer. The core of the second and third fibers 12, 13 is formed of germanosilicate; the cladding layer is formed of pure silica. The optical fibers 12, 13 may further comprise a coating, for example a dual; acrylate coating.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">The apparatus 10 further comprises an optical pump source 14 in the form of a 980nm laser source.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p>

<p id="p0063" num="0063">In use, the doping in the first optical fiber 11 facilitates optical amplification: this is achieved by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the core of fiber 11. In detail, the radiation from the laser source 14 excites the dopant ions into a higher energy level. Once in this higher energy level, the ions decay back to a lower energy level through stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength, thereby amplifying the signal.</p>

<p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idref="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an apparatus 50 used by the applicant to test the effects of ionization on the first optical fiber 11 of the apparatus of <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The various embodiments of this fiber 11 described above have each been tested by the applicant.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">A gamma source 18 was used to simulate the effects of ionization, which are overwhelmingly responsible for radiation induced attenuation (RIA). The non-ionizing effects, such as lattice displacement, were not simulated but a consensus across the industry demonstrates that using a gamma radiation source to simulate the SEP flux is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">100m lengths of fiber 11 was irradiated passively (without light or pump passing through) using a Co60 source for a period of four hours at a dose rate of 50Gy/hr, confirmed by national standards. The total dose was therefore 200Gy, which is equivalent to 146% the total radiation dose in a 20 year mission lifetime in geostationary earth orbit (GEO). The radiation level tolerance was ± 10% and the temperature was maintained between 23 and 25 °C. A 100 meter length of each fiber 11 was kept as a control.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">The fiber attenuation, i.e. optical loss, was tested with a PK2500 system across the wavelengths of interest, before and after radiation. RIA was calculated by subtracting the unradiated attenuation values from the post radiated value at each wavelength. The fiber was left for a year to thermally anneal at room temperature; it is assumed that all appreciable thermal annealing would have occurred in this time period.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Photo annealing was subsequently performed using the optical pump 14 at 974nm at 175mW (measured at the amplifying fiber) with seeds 19 at 1536.61nm, 1541.35nm, 1550.92nm and 1552.52nm. The length of the fiber 11 used was varied as a function of the absorption per meter at 1531nm so that the total absorption over the full length was constant at 80dB for each sample tested. The fiber 11 was pumped continuously at 974nm for several days and the output power was measured at regular intervals by a power meter 20.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, radiating the fiber 11 at a high dose rate for a short amount of time then following with annealing is not identical treatment to simultaneously irradiating the fiber and photo-annealing, as would occur under continuous use in Earth orbit or other space applications. Instead, giving the total dosage in a short amount of time and then annealing the fiber 11 simulates a worst case scenario, since all of the damage requires healing. Furthermore, research<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> within the industry reveals that the same total dose provided as a higher dose rate produces more damage than a lower dose rate for a longer period.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">The output power was extrapolated to 20 years using a power curve fit, in keeping with kinetic models of radiation damage such as those discussed by <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>D.L. Griscom, M.E. Gingerich and E.J. Friebele in "Model for the dose, dose rate, and temperature dependence of radiation-induced loss in optical fibers" (IEEE TRANS.NUCL. SCI., VOL. 41, pp. 523-527, 1994</text></nplcit>) and <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>G. M. Williams and E. J. Frieble in "Space radiation effects on erbium doped fiber devices: sources, amplifiers, and passive measurements" (IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., vol. 45, pp. 1531-1536, June 1998</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">The percentage recovery was found by calculating the extrapolated final output as a percentage of the control fiber output. The results for fibers A, B and C may be seen in <figref idref="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. It will be appreciated that fiber A cannot recover to above 100%; the figure of 100.63% is due to a small standard error within the experimental process.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">Testing as described above has demonstrated that a satellite or spacecraft optical transmission apparatus in accordance with the present invention 10 shows excellent recovery from radiation damage and is likely to withstand a 20 year mission lifetime. It is believed by the applicants that the recovery mechanism is the annealing of point defects associated with trivalent materials under pumping of 980 nm.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">Furthermore, it can be seen from the results of such tests that an optical fiber doped with lanthanum, such as fiber A, show rapid recovery despite suffering substantial initial radiation damage. Accordingly, such fibers are suitable for use in high radiation environments such as space over prolonged periods. In particular, such fibers are best suited to applications where the pump will be active for more than 20% of the mission lifetime. On the other hand, an optical fiber without lanthanum doping, such as fiber B, is more resistant to initial damage but demonstrates a slower rate of recovery. Accordingly, such fibers are optimal for use for less than 20% of a 20 year mission lifetime.</p>
