<heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<heading id="h0002"><u>Field of the invention</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to wireless communication and, more particularly, to a method for selecting V2X transmission resources performed by a terminal in a wireless communication system and a terminal using the method.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><u>Related Art</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The International Telecommunication Union Radio communication sector (ITU-R) is conducting standardization of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-Advanced which is the next-generation mobile communication system following the 3rd generation mobile communication system. IMT-Advanced aims to support Internet Protocol (IP)-based multimedia services with a data rate of 1 Gbps while a terminal is at fixed positions or moves at low speeds and with a data rate of 100 Mbps while a terminal moves at high speeds.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing LTE-A, which is an advanced version of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)/Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) transmission scheme, as a system standard to satisfy the requirements of the IMT-Advanced. The LTE-A is one of strong candidates for the IMT-Advanced.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Recently, there has been a growing interest in the Device-to-Device (D2D) technology which enables direct communication between devices. In particular, D2D communication is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> getting attention as a communication technology to implement a public safety network. Although commercial communication networks are changing fast to adopt the LTE standard, the current public safety network is still relying on the 2G technology because of collision problems with existing communication standards and cost issues. Such technology gap and the demand for improved services have led to the efforts to improve public safety networks.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The D2D communication may be extended to be used for signal transmission and reception between vehicles, where vehicle-related communication is particularly called Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The 'X' in the V2X represents pedestrian (communication between a vehicle and a device carried by individual (for example, handheld terminal carried by a pedestrian, cyclist, driver, or passenger), where, in this case, V2X may be expressed by V2P), vehicle (communication between vehicles, V2V), infrastructure/network (communication between a vehicle and a roadside unit (RSU)/network, where RSU is a transportation infrastructure entity, for example, an entity transmitting speed notifications implemented in an eNB or a stationary UE, V2I/N). A (V2P communication-related) device carried by a pedestrian (or person) is called a "P-UE" while a (V2X communication-related) device installed in a vehicle is called a "V-UE". The term 'entity' in this document may be interpreted as P-UE, V-UE or RSU (/network/infrastructure).</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, in V2X communication, it may be problematic to select which resource in which way when a P-UE tries to transmit a V2X signal. P-UEs tend to be sensitive to battery consumption unlike vehicle-mounted terminals. Also, in V2X communication, it may be important to transmit a signal periodically and not to exert interference on other terminals. A method for selecting a transmission resource for a P-UE needs to be determined by taking into account the facts above.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>3GPP document R1-163032 titled "Details of Sensing for V2V" details of sensing for V2V using sidelink are discussed</text></nplcit>. Simulation results are presented and proposals for system<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> level design are made.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for selecting a V2X transmission resource performed by a UE in a wireless communication system and a UE using the method. The present invention is defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for performing vehicle-to-x (V2X) operation in a wireless communication system is disclosed. The method is performed by a V2X user equipment (UE) and comprise selecting a resource to perform V2X communication within a duration satisfying a latency requirement, and performing the V2X communication based on the selected resource.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The V2X UE selects the resource based on configuring a selection window within the duration satisfying the latency requirement.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The V2X communication may be performed based on a unit of a plurality of subchannels, and the resource to perform V2X communication may be selected based on sensing performed the unit of the plurality of subchannels.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">A sensing duration used for sensing may be a duration having a size corresponding to a size of the plurality of subchannels.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The V2X UE performs sensing based on an energy measurement average value of subchannels included in the plurality of subchannels.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for performing a vehicle-to-x (V2X) in a wireless communication system is disclosed. The method is performed by a V2X user equipment (UE) and comprise selecting a resource to perform a V2X message transmission by performing sensing on a subchannel basis having a size corresponding to a size of subchannels used for the V2X message transmission and performing the V2X<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> message transmission based on the selected resource.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The V2X UE selects the resource based on configuring a selection window within the duration satisfying the latency requirement.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">A sensing duration used for sensing may be a duration having a size corresponding to a size of the plurality of subchannels.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The V2X UE Performs sensing based on an energy measurement average value of subchannels included in the plurality of subchannels.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention, resources involved in V2X communication are reserved in an efficient manner when a UE perform V2X communication. Therefore, since a UE according to the present invention makes use of radio resources efficiently, unnecessary occupation of radio resources is minimized, and thereby efficiency of radio resource is maximized.</p>

<heading id="h0006"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b></heading>
<p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wireless communication system to which the present invention is applied. The wireless communication system may also be referred to as an evolved-UMTS terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) or a long term evolution (LTE)/LTE-A system.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The E-UTRAN includes at least one base station (BS) 20 which provides a control plane and a user plane to a user equipment (UE) 10. The UE 10 may be fixed or mobile, and may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a mobile terminal (MT), a wireless device, etc. The BS 20 is generally a fixed station that communicates with the UE 10 and may be referred to as another terminology, such as an evolved node-B (eNB), a base transceiver system (BTS), an access point, etc.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The BSs 20 are interconnected by means of an X2 interface. The BSs 20 are also connected by means of an S1 interface to an evolved packet core (EPC) 30, more specifically, to a mobility management entity (MME) through S1-MME and to a serving gateway (S-GW) through S1-U.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The EPC 30 includes an MME, an S-GW, and a packet data network-gateway (P-GW). The MME has access information of the UE or capability information of the UE, and such<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> information is generally used for mobility management of the UE. The S-GW is a gateway having an E-UTRAN as an end point. The P-GW is a gateway having a PDN as an end point.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the network can be classified into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well-known in the communication system. Among them, a physical (PHY) layer belonging to the first layer provides an information transfer service by using a physical channel, and a radio resource control (RRC) layer belonging to the third layer serves to control a radio resource between the UE and the network. For this, the RRC layer exchanges an RRC message between the UE and the BS.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a wireless protocol architecture for a user plane. <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a wireless protocol architecture for a control plane. The user plane is a protocol stack for user data transmission. The control plane is a protocol stack for control signal transmission.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIGs. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0003">3</figref>, a PHY layer provides an upper layer with an information transfer service through a physical channel. The PHY layer is connected to a medium access control (MAC) layer which is an upper layer of the PHY layer through a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the PHY layer through the transport channel. The transport channel is classified according to how and with what characteristics data is transferred through a radio interface.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Data is moved between different PHY layers, that is, the PHY layers of a transmitter and a receiver, through a physical channel. The physical channel may be modulated according to an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and use the time and frequency as radio resources.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The functions of the MAC layer include mapping between a logical channel and a transport channel and multiplexing and demultiplexing to a transport block that is provided<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> through a physical channel on the transport channel of a MAC Service Data Unit (SDU) that belongs to a logical channel. The MAC layer provides service to a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer through the logical channel.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The functions of the RLC layer include the concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of an RLC SDU. In order to guarantee various types of Quality of Service (QoS) required by a Radio Bearer (RB), the RLC layer provides three types of operation mode: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and Acknowledged Mode (AM). AM RLC provides error correction through an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ).</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">The RRC layer is defined only on the control plane. The RRC layer is related to the configuration, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers, and is responsible for control of logical channels, transport channels, and PHY channels. An RB means a logical route that is provided by the first layer (PHY layer) and the second layers (MAC layer, the RLC layer, and the PDCP layer) in order to transfer data between UE and a network.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The function of a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer on the user plane includes the transfer of user data and header compression and ciphering. The function of the PDCP layer on the user plane further includes the transfer and encryption/integrity protection of control plane data.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">What an RB is configured means a procedure of defining the characteristics of a wireless protocol layer and channels in order to provide specific service and configuring each detailed parameter and operating method. An RB can be divided into two types of a Signaling RB (SRB) and a Data RB (DRB). The SRB is used as a passage through which an RRC message is transmitted on the control plane, and the DRB is used as a passage through which user data is transmitted on the user plane.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">If RRC connection is established between the RRC layer of UE and the RRC layer of an E-UTRAN, the UE is in the RRC connected state. If not, the UE is in the RRC idle state.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">A downlink transport channel through which data is transmitted from a network to UE includes a broadcast channel (BCH) through which system information is transmitted and a downlink shared channel (SCH) through which user traffic or control messages are transmitted. Traffic or a control message for downlink multicast or broadcast service may be transmitted through the downlink SCH, or may be transmitted through an additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Meanwhile, an uplink transport channel through which data is transmitted from UE to a network includes a random access channel (RACH) through which an initial control message is transmitted and an uplink shared channel (SCH) through which user traffic or control messages are transmitted.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Logical channels that are placed over the transport channel and that are mapped to the transport channel include a broadcast control channel (BCCH), a paging control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control channel (MCCH), and a multicast traffic channel (MTCH).</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The physical channel includes several OFDM symbols in the time domain and several subcarriers in the frequency domain. One subframe includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in the time domain. An RB is a resources allocation unit, and includes a plurality of OFDM symbols and a plurality of subcarriers. Furthermore, each subframe may use specific subcarriers of specific OFDM symbols (e.g., the first OFDM symbol) of the corresponding subframe for a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), that is, an L1/L2 control channel. A Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is a unit time for subframe transmission.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">Hereinafter, a D2D operation will be described. In the 3GPP LTE-A, a service related to the D2D operation refers to Proximity based Services (ProSe). Hereinafter, the ProSe is an equivalent concept with the D2D operation and the ProSe may be compatibly used with the D2D operation. The ProSe is now described.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The ProSe includes ProSe direct communication and ProSe direct discovery. The ProSe direct communication presents communication performed by two or more adjacent terminals. The terminals may perform communication using a protocol of a user plane. A ProSe-enabled UE means a UE for supporting a process related to requirements of the ProSe. Unless otherwise defined, the ProSe-enabled UE includes both of a public safety UE and a non-public safety UE. The public safety UE represents a UE for supporting both of a public safety specified function and the ProSe process. The non-public safety UE is a terminal which supports the ProSe process but does not support the public safety specified function.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The ProSe direct discovery is a process where the ProSe-enabled UE discovers another ProSe-enabled UE. In this case, only ability of the two ProSe-enabled UEs is used. An EPC-level ProSe discovery signifies a process where an EPC determines whether 2 ProSe enable terminals are closed to each other, and reports the close state thereof the two ProSe enabled terminals.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Hereinafter, the ProSe direct communication may refer to D2D communication, and the ProSe direct discovery may refer to D2D discovery.</p>

<p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the reference structure for a ProSe includes a plurality of terminals having E-UTRAN, EPC, and ProSe application program, a ProSe application (APP) server, and a ProSe function.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">An EPC is a representative example of the E-UTRAN. The EPC may include an MME, an S-GW, a P-GW, a policy and charging rules function (PCRF), and a home subscriber server (HSS).</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">The ProSe application server is a user of ProSe in order to make an application function. The ProSe application server may communicate with an application program in the terminal.

<p id="p0055" num="0055">A ProSe enable terminal may use following two modes with respect to resource assignments for the ProSe direct communication.</p>
<heading id="h0009">1. Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">The mode 2 is a mode for receiving scheduling a resource for the ProSe direct communication from a base station. The terminal should be in a RRC_CONNECTED state according to the mode 1 in order to transmit data. The terminal requests a transmission resource to the base station, and the base station schedules a resource for scheduling assignment and data transmission. The terminal may transmit a scheduling request to the base station and may transmit a Buffer Status Report (ProSe BSR). The base station has data which the terminal will perform the ProSe direct communication and determines whether a resource for transmitting the data is required.</p>
<heading id="h0010">2. Mode 2</heading>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The mode 2 is a mode for selecting a direct resource. The terminal directly selects a resource for the ProSe direct communication from a resource pool. The resource pool may<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> be configured by a network or may be previously determined.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Meanwhile, when the terminal includes a serving cell, that is, when the terminal is in an RRC_CONNECTED state with the base station or is located in a specific cell in an RRC_IDLE state, the terminal is regarded to be in coverage of the base station.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">If the terminal is located outside of the coverage, only the mode 2 is applicable. If the terminal is located in the coverage, the mode 1 or the mode 2 may be used according to setting of the base station.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">If there are no exceptional conditions, only when the base station is configured, the terminal may change a mode from the mode 1 to the mode 2 or from the mode 2 to the mode 1.</p>
<heading id="h0011">&lt; ProSe direct discovery (D2D discovery)&gt;</heading>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">The ProSe direct discovery represents a process used to discover when the ProSe enabled terminal discovers other neighboring ProSe enabled terminal and refers to D2D direction discovery or D2D discovery. In this case, an E-UTRA wireless signal through the PC 4 interface may be used. Hereinafter, information used for the ProSe direct discovery refers to discovery information.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a PC 5 interface for D2D discovery.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, the PC 5 interface includes an MAC layer, a PHY layer, and a ProSe Protocol layer being an upper layer. Permission for announcement and monitoring of discovery information is handled in the upper layer ProSe Protocol. Contents of discovery information are transparent to an access stratum (AS). The ProSe Protocol allows only valid discovery information to be transferred to the AS for announcement.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">An MAC layer receives discovery information from the upper layer ProSe Protocol. An IP layer is not used for transmitting the discovery information. The MAC layer determines<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> a resource used in order to announce the discovery information received from the upper layer. The MAC layer makes and sends a protocol data unit (MAC PDU) to a physical layer. An MAC header is not added.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">There are two types of resource assignments for announcing the discovery information.</p>
<heading id="h0012">1. Type 1</heading>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">The type 1 is a method assigned so that resources for announcing the discovery information are not terminal-specific and the base station provides resource pool configuration for announcing the discovery information to the terminals. The configuration may be included in a system information block (SIB) to be signaled in a broadcast scheme. Alternatively, the configuration may be included in a terminal specific RRC message to be provided. Alternatively, the configuration may be broadcast-signaled or terminal-specific signaled of a different layer from the RRC message.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The terminal selects a resource from an indicated resource pool to announce discovery information using the selected resource. The terminal may announce discovery information through a resource optionally selected during each discovery period.</p>
<heading id="h0013">2. Type 2</heading>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The type 2 is a method where resources for announcing the discovery information are terminal-specifically assigned. A terminal in a RRC_CONNECTED state may request a resource for announcing a discovery signal to the base station through a RRC signal. The base station may assign a resource for announcing a discovery signal as an RRC signal. A resource for monitoring the discovery signal in a configured resource pool may be assigned in terminals.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">With respect to a terminal in an RRC_IDLE state, a base station may report a type 1 resource pool for announcing the discovery signal as an SIB. Terminals where ProSe direct<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> discovery is allowed use a type 1 resource pool for announcing the discovery information in the RRC_IDLE state. Alternatively, the base station 2) reports that the base station supports the ProSe direct discovery through the SIB but may not provide the resource for announcing the discovery information. In this case, the terminal should enter the RRC_CONNECTED state for announcing the discovery information.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">With respect to a terminal in an RRC_CONNECTED state, the base station may configure whether to use a type 1 resource pool or a type 2 resource pool for announcing the discovery information through a RRC signal.</p>
<heading id="h0014">&lt;Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication&gt;</heading>
<p id="p0071" num="0071">As described above, D2D operation generally provides various advantages in that it supports signal transmission and reception between devices adjacent to each other. For example, a D2D UE may perform data communication with a high transmission rate and low latency. Also, D2D operation may disperse traffic concentrated at a base station, and if a UE performing a D2D operation acts as a relay, D2D operation may extend the coverage of the base station. As an extension of the D2D communication, vehicle-related communication including signal transmission and reception between vehicles is particularly called Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">In one example, the 'X' in the V2X represents pedestrian (communication between a vehicle and a device carried by individual (for example, handheld UE carried by a pedestrian, cyclist, driver, or passenger), where, in this case, V2X may be expressed by V2P), vehicle (communication between vehicles, V2V), infrastructure/network (communication between a vehicle and a roadside unit (RSU)/network, where RSU is a transportation infrastructure entity, for example, an entity transmitting speed notifications implemented in an eNB or a stationary UE, V2I/N). Also, in one example, for the convenience of description of the proposed method,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> a (V2P communication-related) device carried by a pedestrian (or person) is called a "P-UE" while a (V2X communication-related) device installed in a vehicle is called a "V-UE". Also, in one example, the term 'entity' in this document may be interpreted as P-UE, V-UE or RSU (/network/infrastructure).</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">A V2X UE may perform message (or channel) transmission on a predefined (or signaled) resource pool. Here, a resource pool may refer to a predefined resource(s) which enables a UE to perform a V2X operation (or which is capable of performing a V2X operation). At this time, a resource pool may also be defined in terms of time-frequency aspect.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">Meanwhile, various types of V2X transmission resource pools may be defined.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075"><figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates types of V2X transmission resource pools.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6(a)</figref>, V2X transmission resource pool#A may be a resource pool that allows (partial) sensing only. In the V2X transmission resource pool#A, a UE has to select a V2X transmission resource after performing (partial) sensing, and random selection may not be allowed. As shown in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6(a)</figref>, a V2X transmission resource selected by (partial) sensing is maintained semi-statically at predetermined intervals.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">In order for a UE to perform V2X message transmission on the V2X transmission resource pool#A, a base station may configure a (scheduling assignment decoding/energy measurement-based) sensing operation to be performed (partially). This may be interpreted as not allowing 'random selection' of a transmission resource on the V2X transmission resource pool#A but may be interpreted as (allowing) performing (only) '(partial) sensing' based transmission resource selection. The configuration may be set by the base station.</p>
<p id="p0078" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6(b)</figref>, the V2X transmission resource pool#B may be a resource pool that allows random selection only. In the V2X transmission resource pool#B, a UE may not perform (partial) sensing but select a V2X transmission resource randomly from a selection window. In one example, different from a resource pool which allows (partial) sensing only,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> a resource pool which allows only random selection may set (or signaled) so that a selected resource may not be semi-statically reserved.</p>
<p id="p0079" num="0079">A base station may set not to perform a (scheduling assignment decoding/energy measurement-based) sensing operation so that a UE may perform a V2X message transmission operation on the V2X transmission resource pool#B. This may be interpreted as performing (/allowing) only 'random selection' of a transmission resource on the V2X transmission resource pool#B and/or not allowing '(partial) sensing'-based transmission resource selection.</p>
<p id="p0080" num="0080">Meanwhile, although not shown in <figref idref="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, there may exist a resource pool which allows both (partial) sensing and random selection. A base station may inform (the UE) that in such a resource pool, either of the (partial) sensing and random selection may be used to select a V2X resource.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081"><figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a V2X transmission resource (re)selection (/reservation) method according to a partial sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, a UE (which denotes a P-UE in what follows) may determine (or trigger) (re)selection (or reservation) of a resource for V2X signal transmission (depending on whether a predetermined condition is satisfied). For example, suppose the transmission resource (re)selection (or reservation) is determined or triggered at subframe #m. In this case, the UE may (re)select (or reserve) a resource for V2X signal transmission from within a subframe period ranging from the subframe #m+T1 to #m+T2. In what follows, the subframe period ranging from the subframe #m+T1 to #m+T2 is called a selection window. For example, a selection window may comprise 100 consecutive subframes.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">A UE may select at least Y subframes within a selection window as candidate resources. In other words, a UE may have to consider at least Y subframes as candidate resources within the selection window. The Y may be a predetermined value or may be determined by the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> network. It should be noted that how to select Y subframes within a selection window may be subject to issues of implementing a UE. In other words, suppose the Y value is 50. Then the UE may select which 50 subframes to select among 100 subframes comprising a selection window. For example, the UE may select 50 subframes whose subframe number is an odd number from among the 100 subframes. Likewise, the UE may select 50 subframes whose subframe number is an even number. Similarly, 50 subframes may be selected by an arbitrary rule.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">Meanwhile, in order to (re)select (or reserve) a specific subframe among the Y subframes, for example, subframe #N (SF#N) as a V2X transmission subframe capable of transmitting a V2X signal, the UE may have to be linked to the subframe #N or sense at least one associated subframe. The (whole) subframe period defined for sensing is called a sensing window, which may comprise 1000 subframes, for example. In other words, a sensing window may span 1000 milliseconds or 1 second. For example, the UE may sense subframes corresponding to subframe #N-100*k (where k may be a set of elements in the range [1, 10] and may be preset or determined by the network) within the sensing window.</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085"><figref idref="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a case in which k values are {1, 3, 5, 7, 10}. In other words, the UE may sense subframe #N-1000, #N-700, #N-500, #N-300, and #N-100, infer/determine whether the subframe #N is used by other V2X UE (and/or whether relatively high interference (or interference larger than a preset (or signaled) threshold value) exists on the subframe #N), and (finally) select the subframe #N according to the result. Since a P-UE is more sensitive to battery consumption than a V-UE, not all of the subframes within the sensing window are sensed but only part thereof is sensed, namely partial sensing is performed.</p>

<p id="p0088" num="0088">The UE selects a V2X transmission resource after excluding a specific resource on the basis of scheduling assignment and an additional condition. At this time, if scheduling assignment and data associated therewith are transmitted from the same subframe, a method for excluding a resource on the basis of DM-RS reception power of the PSSCH may be supported. In other words, resources specified or reserved by decoded scheduling assignment and resources the PSSCH Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) received from data resources associated with the scheduling assignment of which exceeds a threshold value are excluded. More specifically, the PSSCH RSRP may be defined as a linear average of power distribution over Resource Elements (REs) carrying DM-RSs associated with the PSSCH within Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) indicated by the PSCCH. The PSSCH RSRP may be measured with respect to the antenna connecting unit of the UE. The scheduling assignment may include a 3-bit PPPP field.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">The threshold value may be expressed as a function of priority information. For example, the threshold value may be dependent on the priority information of a transmission block and priority information of decoded scheduling assignment.

The total resources within the selection window represent the resources that the UE has to consider as possible candidate resources.</p>

<p id="p0116" num="0116">In what follows, the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">The proposed methods described below deal with a situation in which a V2X UE(s) (re)reserves (or selects) its own resource(s) related to V2X message transmission. In this situation, the present invention provides (A) a method for efficiently defining boundaries in the time domain in which a sensing operation is performed and (B) a method for efficiently supporting retransmission (RE-TX) of V2X message(s) omitted (or stopped) as the sensing operation is performed. Here, as one example, the word "sensing" in this document may be<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> interpreted as RSRP measurement operation (for example, S-RSRP) with respect to a (predefined or signaled) Reference Signal (RS) (on the PSSCH scheduled by the PSCCH which has been successfully decoded) and/or energy measurement operation (for example, S-RSSI) with respect to a (sub)channel, or decoding operation with respect to a predefined (signaled) channel (for example, Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH)). In one example, in the present invention, the word "duration" (and/or "period") may be extended to be interpreted as "range (or window)".</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">[Proposed Rule#1] The boundary (or position) of a time region (or period) in which a sensing operation is performed (for each V2X UE(s)) has the form (or characteristic) of "UE-specific (time) boundary". Here, in one example, the boundary (or position) of the time region (or period) in which a (resource (re)reservation (or selection)-related) sensing operation of a specific V2X UE is performed may be defined as "V2X message TX time (SF#K)" (of the corresponding V2X UE). When this rule is applied, in one example, the V2X UE performs a sensing operation at the remaining (resource) time points except for the (resource) time point at which the V2X UE (actually) performs a V2X message TX operation on the resource period ranging from "SF#(K-D) to SF#K (or the resource period ranging from SF#(K-1-D) to SF#(K-1)) (where, in one example, "D" represents a predefined (or signaled) 'sensing duration')" and then (re)reserves (or selects) its own resource(s) related to V2X message TX. Here, as another example, the V2X UE skips (or stops) (last) transmission (of its V2X message) on the 'SF#K' (according to a predefined rule) (if needed), performs sensing (measurement) of up to (SF#K) resources of the V2X UE (or previously reserved (or selected) resources), and immediately performs optimal re-reservation (or selection) of resources (and/or immediately transmits a V2X message by using the re-reserved (or selected) resources). Here, as a still another example, in the case of a V2X UE performing a sensing operation in the resource period, the V2X UE may perform (sensing result-based) resource (re)reservation (or selection) on the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> resource period ranging from "SF#(K+1) to SF#(K+1+R) (or a resource period ranging from SF#K to SF#(K+R), where "R" represents a predefined (or signaled) 'TX resource (re)selection duration')".</p>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">For the convenience of understanding, that the boundary of a time region in which a sensing operation (for each V2X UE(s)) is performed according to the proposed rule#1 takes the form (or characteristic) of a "UE-specific (time) boundary" may be described with reference to related drawings as follows.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120"><figref idref="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for performing V2X communication based on a UE-specific sensing period according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, a UE may select a resource with which to perform V2X communication by performing sensing during a UE-specific sensing period S810. Here, the UE's performing sensing during a specific period (namely, UE-specific sensing period (or UE-specific sensing window)) and selecting a resource with which to perform V2X communication may be described from a viewpoint that (A) the period during which the UE performs sensing (namely, a sensing window) is UE-specific and from a viewpoint that (B) the period during which the UE performs sensing is 1 second (namely, a period corresponding to 1000 subframes, where each subframe occupies a period of 1 ms) and the 1 second corresponds to up to SPS period (or maximum (possible) resource reservation period) length (namely [N-1000, N-1]).</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">(A) First, selection of a resource to perform V2X communication may be described as follows from a viewpoint that the period in which a UE performs sensing (namely a sensing window) is UE-specific.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">As described above, the UE may select a resource to perform V2X communication by performing sensing, where UEs may have different periods during which sensing is performed (namely UE-specific sensing periods). Here, having a UE-specific sensing period does not<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> mean that sensing time itself is different for each UE but the position of the sensing period (namely a sensing window) is different for each UE.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">In other words, the boundary of a time region in which a sensing operation is perform (for each V2X UE(s)) may have the form (or characteristic) of a "UE-specific (time) boundary". In other words, an energy measurement window is UE-specific (in other words, in the case of "[N-A, N-B]" energy sensing (or measurement) period, the N value is UE-specific), which is described with reference to related drawings as follows.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125"><figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an example of a UE-specific sensing window.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, each UE, namely 'UE 1' and 'UE 2' have a sensing window spanning a different time period, and sensing windows may be defined for the respective UEs at different times.</p>
<p id="p0127" num="0127">More specifically, if an upper layer of the UE makes a request at a specific subframe (in what follows, subframe N), the UE may determine a set of resources that have to be transmitted to the upper layer in conjunction with V2X message transmission (for example, PSSCH transmission).</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">Afterwards, the UE monitors during a specific sensing period (excluding subframes in which the UE performs transmission) (for example, subframe N-1000, N-999, N-998, ..., up to N-1). Here, that the UE monitors a specific sensing period (for example, subframe N-1000, N-999, ..., up to N-1) with respect to the subframe N determined by the upper layer of the UE itself means that the sensing window in which the UE performs monitoring is determined by the corresponding UE.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">To describe an example of <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, in the case of UE 1, it may be assumed that the upper layer of UE 1 generates a request at N<sub>_UE1</sub>. In this case, the sensing period of UE 1 (namely, a sensing window) spans the subframe N_UE1-1000, N_UE1-999, ..., up to N_UE1-1, and the sensing window in this case is specific to the UE 1 as shown in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>. In the same<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> manner, in the case of UE 2, it may be assumed that the upper layer of UE 2 generates a request at N<sub>_UE2</sub>. In this case, the sensing period of UE 2 (namely, a sensing window) spans the subframe N_UE2-1000, N_UE2-999, ..., up to N_UE2-1, and the sensing window in this case is specific to the UE 2 as shown in <figref idref="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">Afterwards, the UE may select a resource with which to perform V2X communication on the basis of S-RSSI measured within the aforementioned subframes, namely N-1000, N-999, N-998, ..., N-1 and the decoded PSCCH. Here, a specific example in which the UE selects a resource with which to perform V2X communication is the same as described above.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">(B) The descriptions given below are based on the viewpoint that the period during which the UE performs sensing is 1 second (namely a period of 1000 subframes) and the 1 second corresponds to the maximum Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) (or maximum (possible) resource reservation period) length (namely [N-1000, N-1]).</p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">In one example, if a V2X UE uses a sensing result obtained by monitoring the period comprising 'SF#(N-A), SF#(N-A+1), ..., SF#(N-B) (or SC PERIOD#(N-A), SC PERIOD#(N-A+1), ..., SC PERIOD#(N-B)) (A≥B (for example, the 'B' value may be a positive integer larger than '0' by taking into account the processing time for resource (re)selection)) for (V2X message TX-related) resource (re)reservation (or selection) in a triggered 'SF#N' (or 'SC PERIOD#N'), the "MONITORING WINDOW SIZE (namely, '(A-B)')" may be set to the maximum value of the times at which resource (re)reservation (or selection) occurs (which may be interpreted as the interval between reserved resources, for example). In one example, the corresponding V2X UE selects its transmission resources from the period of 'SF#(N+C), SF#(N+C+1), ..., SF#(N+D) (or SC PERIOD#(N+C), SC PERIOD#(N+C+1), ..., SC PERIOD#(N+D)) (D≥C (for example, the 'C' value may be a positive integer larger than '0' by taking into account the processing time related to PSCCH/PSSCH generation))'. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> specific example, if resource (re)reservation (or selection) is performed every 500 milliseconds, (by taking into account that the time length of a transmission resource (latency requirement) is 100 ms) '(A-B)' may become 400 ms (here, for example, the '400 ms' may be interpreted as the remainder after subtracting one predefined 'SC PERIOD (100 ms)' (latency requirement) from '500 ms'). Also, in one example, the corresponding '400 ms' period may be interpreted as a period ranging from 'SF#(N-500MS)' to 'SF#(N-100MS)'. In other words, the 'SENSING DURATION' (or '(A-B)') may become a function of predefined (or preset) 'resource (re)reservation (or selection) period' (or it may be interpreted as performing a 'sensing operation' during the time period derived from the 'resource (re) reservation (or selection) period). To summarize, in one example, since the same resource will be selected (or used) until 'resource re-reservation (or selection)' is performed, it may be meaningful to sense the resource right before the current ('resource re-reservation (or selection)') period, but it is not required to sense the resource before the time at which the 'resource re-reservation (or selection)' necessarily occurs. Here, in one example, such a rule may be particularly useful when the SA/DATA (pool) is implemented as a 'TDM structure'.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">As another example, it is assumed that the V2X UE(s) performs 'SA (or PSCCH)' transmission related to the 'DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission associated with the 'SF#(N+D)' (for example, D≥C) in the 'SF#(N+C)'. Here, in one example, the 'SF#N' may be assumed (or interpreted) as the time at which (according to a predefined rule (or signaling)) the 'RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION' operation is performed and/or the period ranging from the 'SF#(N-A)' to the SF#(N-B)' (for example, A &gt; B &gt; 0) may be assumed (or interpreted) as the region which provides a sensing result referenced when 'SA (or PSCCH) ('SF#(N+C)') and/or DATA (or PSSCH) ('SF#(N+D)') RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION operation is performed (or in which sensing is performed). Here, in one example, when 'POTENTIAL DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission related to other TB on the 'SF#(N+E)' is performed in the 'SF#(N+D)'<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> (for example, D &lt; E), the V2X UE may inform of the intent of whether to reuse a '(frequency) resource' (used for 'DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission on the 'SF#(N+D)') through a (predefined (or signaled)) channel (for example, 'SA (or PSCCH)' (SF#(N+C)') (or through 'DATA (or PSSCH)'). Here, in one example, a field to which '(E-C)' value (or '(E-D)' value or 'E' value) is (additionally) transmitted may be (newly) defined on the 'SA (or PSCCH)' ('SF#(N+C)') used for the corresponding use. Here, in one example, '(E-C)' value (<b>E_CGAP</b>) (or '(E-D)' value (<b>E_DGAP</b>)) (or 'E' value (<b>E_GAP</b>)) may be interpreted as an interval between 'SA (or PSCCH)' ('SF#(N+C)') transmission time point and 'NEXT TB' related (POTENTIAL) DATA (or PSSCH) transmission time point (or an interval between the 'DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission time point scheduled from 'SA (or PSCCH)' ('SF#(N+C)') and the (POTENTIAL) 'DATA (or PSSCH) transmission time point related to the 'NEXT TB') or 'V2X MESSAGE GENERATION (or TX) PERIODICITY'. Here, in one example, the 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE' (for example, '(B-A)') of the V2X UE may be determined (or configured) according to the following (partial) rule. Here, in one example, 'E-CGAP' (or E_DGAP or E_GAP) related (maximum (or minimum)) value may be set (or signaled) to 'SINGLE VALUE' or 'MULTIPLE VALUE(s)' (in a 'UE-COMMON' or 'UE-SPECIFIC' manner from the network or a (serving) base station) or may be regarded (or assumed) to be the same as the V2X UE's (maximum (or minimum)) 'MESSAGE GENERATION (or TX) PERIODICITY' .</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">(<b>Rule#A</b>) (A) 'E_CGAP' (or E_DGAP or E_GAP) related (maximum (or minimum)) value and/or (B) (maximum (or minimum)) 'MESSAGE GENERATION (or TX) PERIODICITY' value may be considered (or determined) as the 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE'. As another example, the 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE' may be set to a predefined (or signaled) (specific) value irrespective of (A) 'E_CGAP' (or E_DGAP or E_GAP) related (maximum (or minimum)) value and/or (B) (maximum (or minimum)) 'MESSAGE GENERATION (or TX)<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> PERIODICITY' value. Here, in one example, if the aforementioned rule is applied, even when the V2X UE performs 'V2X MESSAGE' transmission having a (relatively) long 'MESSAGE GENERATION (or TX) PERIODICITY', a sensing operation may be performed by using a (relatively) small 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE' (which may be interpreted as a kind of 'PARTIAL (or LIMITED) REGION SENSING'). In one example, in the Rule#A, the 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE' may be set in a 'UE-COMMON' (or 'UE-SPECIFIC') manner.</p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">(<b>Rule#B</b>) A predefined (or signaled) '(V2X) SPS PERIODICITY' value may be considered (or determined) as the 'SENSING WINDOW SIZE'.

As another example, when a plurality of 'SPS configurations (or processes or (transmission) operations) having different '(V2X) SPS PERIODICITIES' are set (or signaled or permitted), the maximum (or minimum) value among the corresponding '(V2X) SPS PERIODICITIES' is determined (or derived) as the '(COMMON) SENSING WINDOW SIZE', which may also be applied commonly to the plurality of 'SPS configurations (or processes or (transmission) operations).

<p id="p0137" num="0137">Here, a receiving UE (RX UE) may figure out the resource reservation period of the final transmitting UE (TX UE) on the basis of the values that may be signaled to the RESOURCE RESERVATION field of the SCI format shown in table 1.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">At this time, by multiplying the value of the resource reservation field by 100, the RX UE may determine the "resource reservation period candidate value' that may be configured by the TX UE. For example, if the value of the resource reservation field is '0001', the resource reservation period may be 100 ms while, if the value of the resource reservation field<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> is '0010', the resource reservation period may be 200 ms. In the same manner, if the value of the resource reservation field is '1010', the resource reservation period may be 1000 ms.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">To summarize, the RX UE may figure out that the "resource reservation period candidate" values which may be set by the TX UE by multiplying the value of the resource reservation field by 100 are "20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 ms", and accordingly, the maximum value of the SPS period may have the value of 1000 ms (namely 1 s).</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">As described above, the period in which a UE performs sensing (namely a sensing window of the UE) may have the maximum SEMI-PERSISTENT SCHEDULING (SPS) period (or the maximum (possible) resource reservation period), and accordingly, the period in which the UE performs sensing (namely a sensing window) may be 1000 ms (namely 1s0 which is the maximum value of the SPS period.</p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Referring again to <figref idref="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, the UE may perform V2X communication by using the selected resources S820. As described above (or below), the UE may select a subframe within a selected window on the basis of a sensing result obtained by performing sensing during a UE-specific sensing period, determine transmission reservation resources on the basis of selected subframes, and perform V2X communication on the reserved resources. Since specific example in which the UE performs V2X communication on the basis of selected resources is the same as described above (or below), specific details will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">Meanwhile, end-to-end latency has to be taken into account for V2X communication. In other words, when the UE transmits a packet generated in the upper layer, not only the time required to send a packet generated in the upper layer down to the physical layer but also the time for the RX UE to receive the packet and send the received packet up to the upper layer of the RX UE has to be considered. Therefore, how to configure a period during which the UE<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> selects a resource for performing a V2X message transmission, namely a selection window to select a transmission resource becomes of importance. In what follows, a method for configuring a selection window will be described with reference to related drawings.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143"><figref idref="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for configuring a selection window according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">A UE selects a resource (or subframe and in what follow, a resource and a subframe may be used interchangeably for the convenience of description) with which to perform V2X communication within a range satisfying a latency requirement S1010. At this time, the UE selects the resource by configuring a selection window within a range satisfying the latency requirement, the V2X communication may be performed in units of multiple sub-channels, and a resource for performing the V2X communication may be selected on the basis of the sensing result obtained by performing in units of sub-channels the size of which corresponds to the size of the multiple sub-channels. The sensing region in which the sensing is performed may have the size corresponding to that of the plurality of sub-channels. Moreover, the UE may also perform sensing by using the energy measurement average value of sub-channels belonging to the multiple sub-channels.</p>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">To summarize, the UE may not only select the resource by configuring a selection window within a range satisfying the latency requirement but also perform sensing in units of multiple sub-channels when the V2X communication is performed in units of multiple sub-channels. A specific example in which sensing is performed in units of multiple sub-channels when the V2X communication is performed in units of multiple sub-channels will be described later.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">In what follows, an example in which the UE selects a transmission resource within a range satisfying the latency requirement will be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">The UE (configures a selection window and) selects a transmission resource (or<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> subframe) within a range satisfying the latency requirement. Here, the UE may assume that a set of neighboring sub-channels (for example, LsubCH) in the V2X resource pool (for example, PSSCH resource pool) belonging to a specific period (for example, [n+T1, n+T2]) correspond to one candidate subframe (resource). At this time, selection of information (for example, T1 and T2) for determining the specific period may depend on how the UE is implemented. T1 may have a value less than or equal to 4 while T2 may have a value not less than 20 and not more than 100. In particular, UE's selection of T2 has to satisfy the latency requirement.</p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">For example, 'SENSING DURATION (D)' and/or 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (R)' may be (implicitly) assumed to be the same as the 'V2X MESSAGE GENERATION PERIOD' (and/or '(SERVICE) LATENCY REQUIREMENT') (and/or depending on the 'V2X MESSAGE GENERATION PERIOD' (and/or '(SERVICE) LATENCY REQUIREMENT' and/or '(V2X MESSAGE (or TB)) or 'PPPP' (for example, when a (partly) different 'PPPP' value is set (or permitted) for each V2X MESSAGE (or TB) having a different '(SERVICE) LATENCY REQUIREMENT'), may be assumed (or changed) differently) and/or assume a predefined (or signaled) specific value (for example, the corresponding rule may be interpreted that 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (R)' is configured to satisfy the '(SERVICE) LATENCY REQUIREMENT'). Here, in one example, (in particular, in the latter case), the 'SENSING DURATION (D)' and 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (R)' may (always) be set (or considered) to have the same value or may be defined to have an independent (or different) value. As another example, the boundary of the time region in which the (resource (re)reservation (or selection)-related) sensing operation of a specific V2X UE is performed may be defined as "V2X MESSAGE GENERATION TIME" (of the corresponding V2X UE). As a yet another example, when the '(TX) PROCESSING TIME' (of the V2X UE) is considered, the time point obtained<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> by adding (or subtracting) a predefined (or signaled) offset to (or from) the 'boundary criterion of a time region in which a sensing operation (related to resource (re)reservation (or selection)) is performed' described above (for example, 'V2X MESSAGE TX TIME' and 'V2X MESSAGE GENERATION TIME') may become the final 'boundary criterion of a time region in which a sensing operation is performed'. As a specific example, the V2X UE performs a sensing operation at the remaining (resource) time points except for the (resource) time point at which the V2X UE itself (actually) performs the V2X MESSAGE TX operation in the resource period ranging from "SF#(K-D-S) to SF#(K-S) (or in the resource period ranging from SF#(K-1-D-S) to SF#(K-1-S) (where, in one example, "D" and "S" represent the predefined (or signaled) 'SENSING DURATION' and '(TX) PROCESSING TIME' (of the V2X UE), respectively" and then (re)reserve (or select) a V2X MESSAGE TX-related resource(s) of the V2X UE itself (in the resource period ranging from "SF#(K+1) to SF#(K+1+R) (or from SF#K to SF#(K+R)) (where, in one example, "R" represents the predefined (or signaled) 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION')).</p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">Afterwards, the UE may perform V2X communication by using the selected resource S1020. Here, as described above, the selected resource may indicate the resource determined on the basis of a selection window constructed within a range satisfying the LATENCY REQUIREMENT (in other words, a resource on the selection window satisfying the latency requirement). Also, as described above (or below), the UE may select a subframe within the selection window on the basis of a sensing result obtained by performing sensing in a UE-specific sensing period, determine transmission reservation resources on the basis of the selected subframe, and perform V2X communication on the reserved resource.

<p id="p0183" num="0183">Meanwhile, although a UE performs sensing in (each) sub-channel (by default), actual transmission of a V2X message may be performed in units of a plurality of sub-channels. If the UE uses a plurality of sub-channels used for actual transmission of a V2X message (namely, if transmission of a V2X message is performed in units of a plurality of sub-channels), how to perform sensing needs to be taken into account. In this respect, in what follows, described will be a method for performing sensing when a plurality of sub-channels is used for transmission of a V2X message.</p>
<p id="p0184" num="0184"><b>[Proposed method]</b> In one example, a rule may be defined so that a V2X UE(s) performs a sensing operation in 'units of resource size' to be used (by the V2X UE itself) for 'V2X message TX'. When the corresponding rule is applied, the 'sensing resource unit size' of the V2X UE becomes the same as the 'resource size' to be used (by the corresponding V2X UE) for 'V2X message TX'. For example, when the UE performs energy measurement through a sensing operation, in which unit or size to perform the energy measurement may have to be considered. At this time, the proposed method according to the present invention may set the resource unit or size used by the UE for data transmission, for example, a sub-channel<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> size, as the unit or size of energy measurement. For example, when the UE performs V2X message transmission with a specific sub-channel size, energy measurement for a sensing operation may be performed in units of resources with the specific sub-channel size. In what follows, the proposed method will be described with reference to related drawings.</p>
<p id="p0185" num="0185"><figref idref="f0018">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for performing sensing when multiple sub-channels are used for transmission of a V2X message according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0186" num="0186">According to <figref idref="f0018">FIG. 18</figref>, the UE performs sensing in units of sub-channel the size of which is equal to the size of a sub-channel used for transmission of a V2X message, thereby selecting a resource with which to perform transmission of a V2X message S1810. At this time, the UE may select the resource by configuring a selection window within a range satisfying the latency requirement, transmission of the V2X message is performed in units of multiple sub-channels, and a resource with which to perform the V2X communication may be selected on the basis of the sensing performed in units of sub-channel the size of which is equal to the size of the plurality of sub-channels. The size of a sensing region used when the sensing is performed may be equal to the size of the plurality of sub-channels. Moreover, the UE may perform sensing by using an energy measurement average value of sub-channels belonging to the plurality of sub-channels.</p>
<p id="p0187" num="0187">To summarize, when V2X communication is performed in units of multiple sub-channels, the UE may not only perform sensing in units of multiple sub-channels but also select the resource by configuring a selection window within a range that satisfies the latency requirement.

<p id="p0190" num="0190">When sensing (for example, ENERGY MEASUREMENT) is performed with the sub-channel size of data to be transmitted by the UE, a linear average value of sub-channels may be used.

As another example, (from the proposed rule,) 'FIELD#F' (which, for example, may be interpreted as 'TIMING GAP' between the 'SA (or PSCCH)' transmission time and the 'associated DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission time) (or a field informing of the 'intent' of whether to reuse '(frequency) resource' employed for previous 'DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission when other 'TB' related 'POTENTIAL DATA (or PSSCH)' transmission is performed afterwards (at particular time)) may be defined (or signaled) independently at each 'SA (or PSCCH)' transmission (or in the same manner (for all 'SA (or PSCCH)' transmission)). Here, when the corresponding rule is applied, the V2X UE(s) may be made to attempt to decode (or receive) (all of the 'K' transmissions) with respect to the 'K' transmission-related 'SA (or PSCCH)'. In a yet another example, (from the proposed rule) (when one 'TB' is transmitted from multiple SFs,) a V2X TX UE may perform 'RESOURCE RESELCTION' operation (in the middle of operation) according to a predefined (or signaled) rule (which includes, for example, a case where 'SA (or PSCCH)' (or 'DATA (or PSSCH)') having a 'HIGHER PRIORITY' transmitted by other V2X UE(s) is detected and a case where 'CURRENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION' does not satisfy the predefined (or signaled) 'REQUIREMENT' (for example, LATENCY, RELIABILITY, PRIORITY, FAIRNESS, and QoS)). Therefore, the V2X RX UE may be made to follow the 'subsequent SA (PSSCH)'<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> when (the corresponding 'TB' related) 'subsequent SA (or PSSCH)' performs scheduling different from the 'previous SA (or PSCCH)'.</p>

In another example, when 'frequency resource (position)' information (or field) is defined on the 'SA (or PSCCH)' and '(DATA (or PSSCH)) FREQUENCY HOPPING' operation is performed, the 'frequency resource (position)' information (or field) value itself may be set differently for each 'SA (or PSCCH)' transmission (by taking into account the '(DATA (or PSSCH)) FREQUENY HOPPING pattern'). This is so because, after '(DATA (or PSSCH)) FREQUENCY HOPPING' is applied to the 'frequency resource (position)' scheduled by the 'N-th transmission'-related 'SA (or PSCCH)', the '(N+1)-th transmission'-related 'SA (or PSCCH)' has to designate (or signal) the (corresponding) changed 'frequency resource (position)'.</p>

At this time, the finite number may be proportional to a counter value (for example, SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER) selected (or determined) randomly, where the counter value may have a positive integer.

In one example, (to solve the corresponding problem), if there is not a TB (or packet) to be transmitted for more than a predefined (or signaled) threshold (time) value (in the (LOW LAYER) butter (and/or PDCP LAYER)) (and/or if (actual) TB (or packet) transmission is not performed (continuously)) (and/or if the (current) subframe index exceeds 10240 (or TNUM_V2XSF) and/or if the (finite number of) subframes (or resources) reserved (or selected) by the V2X TX UE#M are (all) passed (in the time region)), the V2X TX UE#M (whose (selected) counter value is a positive integer value) may be made to perform a transmission resource (re)reservation (or selection) operation, but the (transmission resource (re)reservation) counter value may be made to be selected (randomly) (or (instead of newly (randomly) selecting the counter value), the (transmission resource (re)reservation) counter value may use (or maintain or apply) an existing value (SEL_CNTVAL) (or the remaining<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> value (or a predefined (or signaled) (other) value)).</p>
<p id="p0235" num="0235">To summarize, resource reselection conditions for a UE may include (A) a case in which there is no more resources left for V2X transmission (for example, as described above, a case where 'the subframes (or resources) reserved (or selected) by the UE are (all) passed'), (B) a case in which the UE does not perform packet transmission for 1 continuous second (for example, as described above, a case where '(continuous) TB (or packet) transmission is not performed for more than a predefined (or signaled) threshold time value'), and (C) a case in which the UE skips a predetermined number of consecutive transmission opportunities (for example, as described above, a case where 'TB (or packet) transmission is not performed (continuously) for more than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value'). In what follows, a specific example of the aforementioned resource reselection condition will be described.</p>
<heading id="h0017">(A) The case where no more resources are left for v2X transmission</heading>
<p id="p0236" num="0236">When no more resources related to a configured sidelink grant are left, the UE may perform resource reselection. In other words, if no more resources related to a configured sidelink grant are left but there is a new MAC PDU to be transmitted to the UE, resource reselection may be triggered (in other words, in the aforementioned case, the UE may perform resource reselection).</p>
<p id="p0237" num="0237">In one example, while the (corresponding) finite number of (and/or TNUM_V2XSF) reserved (or selected) subframes (or resources) are (all) passed (in the time region) (and/or a predefined (or signaled) subframe index (for example, 10240 (or TNUM_V2XSF)) passes), if the (selected) counter value does not become "0" (and/or a "negative integer value"), the V2X TX UE(s) may be made to perform a transmission resource (re)reservation (or selection) operation, but the (transmission resource (re)reservation) counter value may be made to be selected (randomly) (or (instead of newly (randomly) selecting the counter value), the (transmission resource (re)reservation) counter value may use (or maintain or apply) an<!-- EPO <DP n="76"> --> existing value (SEL_CNTVAL) (or the remaining value (or a predefined (or signaled) (other) value)).</p>
<heading id="h0018">(B) The case where the UE does not perform packet transmission for one continuous second</heading>
<p id="p0238" num="0238">If transmission or retransmission is not performed (by an MAC entity) on a resource indicated by a configured sidelink grant for (last) 1 second, the UE may perform resource reselection. In other words, when the UE does not perform transmission or retransmission for a continuous transmission opportunity lasting 1 second, resource reselection may be triggered.</p>
<p id="p0239" num="0239">(C) The case where the UE skips a predetermined number of consecutive transmission opportunities</p>
<p id="p0240" num="0240">If the UE is configured with a predetermined value and the number of unused transmission opportunities (on a resource indicated by a configured sidelink grant) is the same as the predetermined value, the UE may perform resource reselection. In other words, if a specific value is set for the UE and the UE skips as many transmission opportunities as the specific number continuously, the UE may perform resource reselection.</p>
<p id="p0241" num="0241">In other words, if the UE skips N (which is a positive integer) consecutive transmission opportunities, resource reselection may be triggered. Here, when the aforementioned condition is applied, the N is set for the UE, where N may take a value from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].</p>
<p id="p0242" num="0242">For example, if the UE skips '5' consecutive transmission opportunities and is configured to perform resource reselection, the UE may perform resource reselection when not performing transmission for 5 consecutive transmission opportunities.</p>
<p id="p0243" num="0243">Afterwards, if the resource reselection condition is satisfied, the UE may perform reselection of a resource with which V2X communication is performed S2420. In other words, if the resource reselection condition is satisfied, the UE may reselect a resource with which<!-- EPO <DP n="77"> --> V2X communication is performed, after which the UE may perform V2X communication on the selected resource. For example, as described above, when (A) a case in which there is no more resources left for V2X transmission (for example, as described above, a case where 'the subframes (or resources) reserved (or selected) by the UE are (all) passed'), (B) a case in which the UE does not perform packet transmission for 1 continuous second (for example, as described above, a case where '(continuous) TB (or packet) transmission is not performed for more than a predefined (or signaled) threshold time value'), or (C) a case in which the UE skips a predetermined number of consecutive transmission opportunities (for example, as described above, a case where 'TB (or packet) transmission is not performed (continuously) for more than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value'), the UE may reselect a resource with which V2X communication is performed and perform V2X communication on the selected resource.</p>
<p id="p0244" num="0244">Afterwards, the UE may perform V2X communication by using the selected resource S2430. Here, as described above, the selected resource may indicate the resource determined on the basis of a selection window constructed within a range satisfying the LATENCY REQUIREMENT (in other words, a resource on the selection window satisfying the latency requirement). Also, as described above (or below), the UE may select a subframe within the selection window on the basis of a sensing result obtained by performing sensing in a UE-specific sensing period, determine transmission reservation resources on the basis of the selected subframe, and perform V2X communication on the reserved resource. Since a specific example in which the UE performs V2X communication on the basis of a selected resource is the same as described above (or below), specific details will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p0245" num="0245">Here, in one example, the term of the (corresponding) "transmission resource (re)reservation (or selection) operation" may be interpreted as (A) re-reserving (or selecting) a transmission resource (different from (or the same as) the existing resource) on the basis of a<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --> sensing result when the V2X TX UE(s) determines not to maintain (or reuse) a (transmission) resource selected previously on the basis of a (predefined (or signaled)) probability value (KEEP_P) (or irrespective of the corresponding probability value (KEEP_P)) and/or (B) the V2X TX UE(s)'s maintaining (or reusing) a (transmission) resource selected previously on the basis of a (predefined (or signaled)) probability value (KEEP_P) (or irrespective of the corresponding probability value (KEEP_P)) and/or (C) reserving (or selecting) (again) a finite number (or a predefined (or signaled) (other) number (which, for example, is interpreted to be larger than (or larger than or equal to) SEL_CNTVAL value (and/or a value derived from the SEL_CNTVAL value)) of subframes which are the same as existing subframes (or the same resources (as the existing ones)).</p>
<p id="p0246" num="0246"><b>(Example#4)</b> In one example, (when the V2X TX UE#U performs (re)reservation (or selection) of a transmission resource and/or determines the position of a selected (or reserved) subframe (or resource) of other V2X TX UE#Z) if a finite (or infinite) number of (reserved (or selected)) subframes (or resources) having a resource reservation (interval) period of "P" exceed the (previous) 10240-th subframe (for example, the "Z"-th subframe (here, in one example, "Z" is a positive integer value larger than "10240")), the V2X TX UE#U may be made to consider (or assume) that reservation (or selection) (of a subframe (or resource)) is performed with the resource reservation (interval) period "P" (again) from the "MOD (Z, 10240)"-th subframe within the next (or following) 10240 subframes.</p>
<p id="p0247" num="0247"><b>(Example#5)</b> (in the case of (Example#1) and/or (Example#2) and/or (Example#3) and/or (Example#4)) reservation (or selection) (of a finite (or infinite) number of subframes (or resources)) itself may be performed (by the V2X UE(s)) while the reservation (or selection) is allowed to exceed the SFN range (or TNUM_V2XSF range) (by applying SFN WRAP AROUND), and the V2X UE(s) may be made to perform to skip strange (time point) subframes (or resources) (from valid transmission subframes (or resources)) (and/or to extend the SFN<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --> range (or TNUM_V2XSF range) for reservation (or selection) of (a finite (or infinite) number of) subframes (or resources)) while maintaining the resource reservation (interval) period "P" of the V2X UE(s).</p>
<p id="p0248" num="0248"><b>(Example#7)</b> In one example, the following describe a method for supporting an efficient (V2X message (or TB)) transmission operation of the V2X TX UE(s). In what follows, it is assumed that the UE reserves 10*C subframes at the intervals of the resource reservation period P, where C may represent SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER determined by the MAC.</p>
<p id="p0249" num="0249">(A) As described above, the UE's reserving 10*C subframes at the intervals of the resource reservation period P may raise largely two problems.</p>
<p id="p0250" num="0250">First, although the UE reserves a finite number of subframes, SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER may be decreased only when the MAC PDU is transmitted. Therefore, when the upper layer stops packet generation for a specific time period and transmission is skipped in a large number of reserved subframes, reserved resources for the UE may become no longer valid, and no more resources may be available for transmission of a newly arrived packet.</p>
<p id="p0251" num="0251">Also, if the time period of a set of reserved subframes exceeds a D2D FRAME NUMBER (DFN) range (namely, 10*C*P &gt; T<sub>max</sub>, where T<sub>max</sub> is 10240 or 10176), a subframe number in the second DFN range may not be divided by 100 (namely, division by 100 may give a remainder).</p>
<p id="p0252" num="0252">For example, as shown in <figref idref="f0022">FIG. 22</figref>, if a V2X subframe has an index range of 10240, and the UE reserves subframes having an index of {0, 100, ..., 10200, 10300, ..., 14900}, the subframe number from 10300 to 14900 exceeds the DFN range; therefore, only the subframes having an index of {0, 100, ..., 10200, 60, 160, ..., 3660} may be reserved.</p>
<p id="p0253" num="0253">(B) In this regard, a method for solving the aforementioned two problems will be<!-- EPO <DP n="80"> --> provided in what follows.</p>
<p id="p0254" num="0254">First of all, to solve the first problem, when SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER is still larger than 0 even if no more resources reserved by the UE are left, the UE may extend resource reservation.</p>
<p id="p0255" num="0255">To solve the second problem, the number of reserved subframes may be configured independently from the counter value. Moreover, the number of reserved subframes may be configured to be smaller than the counter value. For example, when resource reservation is triggered, the UE may reserve a set of subframes up to the boundary of the DFN range.</p>
<p id="p0256" num="0256"><figref idref="f0025">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates one example of a method for performing resource reservation by taking into account the proposal described above.</p>
<p id="p0257" num="0257">According to <figref idref="f0025">FIG. 25</figref>, by considering the aforementioned two proposals together, the UE may first determine a set of subframes terminated before the DFN boundary and repeat resource reservation at the same resource reservation intervals if more resources are required.</p>
<p id="p0258" num="0258">(C) The aforementioned proposal may be summarized as follows.
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>Proposal 1: when SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER is still larger than 0 even when the UE does not have reserved resources any more, the UE may extend resource reservation.</li>
<li>Proposal 2: when resource reservation is triggered, the UE may reserve a set of subframes up to the boundary of a current DFN range.</li>

<p id="p0261" num="0261">Meanwhile, when the UE performs transmission while sensing is conducted (in a sensing window), namely, a UE may not be able to perform sensing (due to the half-duplex<!-- EPO <DP n="85"> --> problem) for a subframe within the sensing window in which V2X transmission is performed. At this time, when the UE performs V2X message transmission on a subframe corresponding to the subframe unable to perform sensing at specific periods, the UE is led to transmit a V2X message on the basis of the subframe which failed to perform sensing.</p>
<p id="p0262" num="0262">In this regard, in what follows, to solve the problem of a UE's transmitting a V2X message on the basis of a subframe which has failed to perform sensing, a method for excluding a subframe (from a selection window) related to the subframe in which the UE has failed to perform sensing will be described with reference to related drawings.</p>

In other words, excluding a subframe in the selection window related to a subframe in which transmission has been performed during the sensing period among a plurality of subframes in the selection window, the UE may select a subframe from the plurality of subframes except for the excluded subframe in the selection window.</p>
<p id="p0265" num="0265">Here, the subframe in the selection window related to a subframe in which transmission has been performed during a sensing period may be overlapped with a subframe corresponding to the subframe in which the UE is unable to perform sensing according to a resource reservation period of a selected subframe selected by the UE selects within the selection window. For the convenience of understanding, the present descriptions will be further elaborated with reference to a related drawing.</p>

<p id="p0269" num="0269">Referring again to <figref idref="f0026">FIG. 26</figref>, to generalized the aforementioned operation, for example, if the UE has failed to perform sensing (as a V2X message transmission is performed) in the subframe #k (within the sensing window) and the subframe #(y+P*j) and the subframe #(K+100*i) are overlapped with each other, the UE may exclude the subframe #y within the selection window from resource reservation selection. Here, as described above, the subframe #k corresponds to the subframe in which the UE has failed to perform sensing, and the subframe #y may indicate a subframe within the selection window. Also, the P may represent the resource reservation period of the UE, where, for example, P may have a value of 100 ms. The j may assume a value of 0, 1, 2, ..., C_<sub>resel</sub>-1. As described above, C_<sub>resel</sub> may represent a value proportional to a specific counter value (for example 10*SE_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER). Since descriptions about a specific counter (namely SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER) are the same as described above, specific descriptions thereof will be omitted. Also, i may represent an element in a set which is restricted by a carrier-specific setting.

Here, it is assumed that H_VAL (and/or H_MAXVAL) value is set to "5" (which, for example, is denoted as "H"). Here, the H_VAL value (and/or H_MAXVAL) (and/or V2X resource pool configuration (or signaling) related bitmap value) may be set (or signaled) (in a restrictive manner) so that the (increased) "(maximum) DFN RANGE" value may be divided by the V2X resource pool configuration-related (set (or signaled)) bitmap length (without a remainder) (and/or so that (on the (whole) subframes set (or signaled) as a V2X resource pool) ((on a specific carrier (or pool)) a period corresponding to the multiple of (actually) selectable (or allowable)) (maximum (or minimum) or predefined (or signaled)) "RESOURCE RESERVATION INTERVAL" (for example, "100 ms") may be "WRAPPED AROUND" (properly)). If the aforementioned rule is applied, the V2X UE(s) increases the H_VAL value by a predefined (or signaled) value (for example, "1") each time "the (maximum) DFN RANGE" value (for example, "1024 (or 10240)") is reached and uses (or considers) a (V2X) subframe in the ascending order of index starting from a relatively small value within a (V2X) subframe (set) based on the same H_VAL value for (V2X message) transmission (and/or V2X communication). As another example, in the sensing operation, the "SUBFRAME INDEX" uses the "LOGICAL INDEX" within the (V2X) resource pool. Here, in one example, when the "TDM" scheme is applied to a (predefined)<!-- EPO <DP n="94"> --> other signal and a (V2X) resource pool, a physical time interval may become relatively large.

<li>Proposal 3: The current H-DFN may be signaled as part of elements constituting a<!-- EPO <DP n="97"> --> resource pool from the eNB. And the current H-DFN may also be signaled through the PSBCH.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0301" num="0301">As another example, in the aforementioned example, H<sub>max</sub> value (without additional signaling) may be fixed (on the specification) as a predefined value. Here, the H<sub>max</sub> value may be fixed to "25" (or "a multiple of 25"). Table 4, 5, and 6 show analysis data related to the descriptions above.<!-- EPO <DP n="98"> -->

<p id="p0303" num="0303">Meanwhile, when the UE performs V2X message transmission on a specific carrier, the UE may not perform V2X message transmission by using all of the subframes on the carrier. In this regard, by taking into account a subframe in which the UE does not perform V2X message transmission, an example of a method for transmitting a V2X message will be described with reference to related drawings.</p>
<p id="p0304" num="0304"><figref idref="f0034">FIG. 34</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for performing V2X communication on an allocated V2X resource pool according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0305" num="0305">Referring to <figref idref="f0034">FIG. 34</figref>, the UE may allocate a V2X resource pool to the remaining subframes except for a specific subframe S3410. At this time, the specific subframe may represent (A) SLSS subframe, (B) DL and S (Special) subframe in the case of a TDD shared carrier, or (C) reserved subframes. In what follows, a more specific example in which a subframe excluded from V2X transmission will be described.</p>
<heading id="h0019">(A) About the SLSS subframe</heading>
<p id="p0306" num="0306">First, the UE may allocate a V2X resource pool for the remaining subframes except for the SLSS subframe.</p>
<p id="p0307" num="0307">More specifically, the SLSS subframe may be excluded from the mapping according<!-- EPO <DP n="104"> --> to a (repeated) V2V pool bitmap (namely a bitmap (or information) indicating the subframes to which a V2X pool may be allocated), and at this time, the bitmap length may be 16, 20, or 100. The bitmap may define which subframe allows V2V SA and/or data transmission and/or data reception. An example in which an SLSS subframe is excluded from V2X transmission will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p0308" num="0308"><figref idref="f0035">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates an example in which an SLSS subframe is excluded from V2X transmission.</p>
<p id="p0309" num="0309"><figref idref="f0035">FIG. 35</figref> assumes that the subframe number may have a value of 0, 1, ..., 10239 (namely, a total of 10240 subframes), a V2X bitmap is repeated in units of 10 subframes, and the V2X bitmap is [0110101101].</p>
<p id="p0310" num="0310">When a V2X logical index is allocated, the UE may allocate a V2X logical index with respect to the subframes except for the SLSS subframe. For example, if it is assumed that the subframe index #3, #163, and so on correspond to the SLSS subframe (where the SLSS subframe is repeated in units of 160 subframes), the V2X UE may allocate a V2X logical index to the remaining subframes (namely the remaining subframes except for the SLSS subframe) except for the subframe index #3, #163, and so on (S3510). Here, it may be assumed that a V2X resource is allocated according to the V2X bitmap with respect to the subframe allocated by the V2X logical index.</p>
<p id="p0311" num="0311">At this time, the V2X logical index derived through the aforementioned process may not correspond to an integer multiple of the V2X bitmap. For example, when the SLSS subframe is allocated in units of 160 subframes, 64 SLSS subframes may be defined among 10240 subframes as described above, and accordingly, the V2X logical index may be allocated to 10176 subframes corresponding to 10240 - 10264.</p>
<p id="p0312" num="0312">As described above, when it is assumed that the V2X logical index may be allocated to the 10176 subframes, and the V2X bitmap period is 10, the logical index is not divided<!-- EPO <DP n="105"> --> exactly by the V2X bitmap period. In other words, when a V2X bitmap having a period of 10 is allocated to 10176 subframes, there may be chances that bits are not allocated to 6 subframes.</p>
<p id="p0313" num="0313">Therefore, the UE may exclude as many subframes as the number of non-allocated subframes may be excluded from allocation of V2X logical index S3520. At this time, subframes not allocated may be evenly distributed.</p>
<heading id="h0020">(B) About DL and SPECIAL (S) subframe</heading>
<p id="p0314" num="0314">In the case of a TDD (shared) carrier, DL and/or SPECIAL (S) subframe may be excluded from the mapping due to a (repeated) V2V full bitmap. An example in which DL and/or SPECIAL (S) subframe is excluded from V2X transmission will be described below with reference to related drawings.</p>
<p id="p0315" num="0315"><figref idref="f0036">FIG. 36</figref> illustrates an example in which DL and S subframe are excluded from V2X transmission.</p>
<p id="p0316" num="0316"><figref idref="f0036">FIG. 36</figref> assumes that the subframe number may have a value of 0, 1, ..., 10239 (namely a total of 10240 subframes), the V2X bitmap is repeated in units of 10 subframes, and the V2X bitmap is [0110101101].</p>
<p id="p0317" num="0317">When the V2X logical index is allocated, the UE may allocate the V2X logical index to the subframe except for DL and/or SPECIAL (S) subframe (and/or SLSS subframe). For example, if it is assumed that the subframe index #7 (and so on) corresponds to the DL and SPECIAL (S) subframe, the V2X UE may allocated the V2X logical index to the remaining subframes except for the subframe index #7 (and so on) S3610. Here, the UE may allocate a V2X resource according to the V2X bitmap with respect to a subframe allocated by the V2X logical index.</p>
<p id="p0318" num="0318">Afterwards, the UE may exclude as many subframes as a number of non-allocated subframes additionally to the allocation of V2X logical index S3520. At this time, non-allocated<!-- EPO <DP n="106"> --> subframes may be evenly distributed.</p>
<heading id="h0021">(C) The case of a reserved subframe</heading>
<p id="p0319" num="0319">A resource pool is composed of a plurality of reserved subframes so that the bitmap is repeated an integer number of times within a specific range (for example, D2D Frame Number (DFN) range). For example, the V2X (for example, V2V) logical subframe index may not be allocated to a reserved subframe. Moreover, the position of a reserved subframe may be marked implicitly.</p>
<p id="p0320" num="0320">To summarize, the corresponding problem occurs because the bitmap related to the V2X resource pool configuration is applied unconditionally to WAN communication-related DL/UL (time (or frequency)) resources except only for (predefined (or signaled)) V2X SYNC. SIGNAL transmission-related (time (or frequency)) resources (for example, V2X SYNCH. SUBFRAME(s)) (and/or because of the DFN WRAP AROUND problem (or phenomenon). Here, to solve the corresponding problem, the V2X TX UE(s) may be made to (A) assume that (part of) V2X resources (designated by the bitmap) on the WAN communication related DL (time (or frequency)) resources are not valid (in terms of (V2X pool-related) "LOGICAL INDEXING") and/or (B) to skip (V2X message (or TB)) transmission operation for (part of) (periodic) transmission resources reserved (or selected) (by the V2X TX UE(s)) on the WAN communication-related DL (time (or frequency)) resources (and/or instead of skipping the (V2X message (or TB)) transmission operation, the (V2X message (or TB)) transmission operation may be (re)performed on the (closest) valid (or available) V2X resource after the transmission operation. Here, in the former case, (V2X pool-related) "LOGICAL INDEXING" may be regarded as being performed by involving (or excluding) the invalid resource (for example, DL (time (or frequency)) resource) (for example, when transmission timing of a specific period is determined on the "LOGICAL INDEX", a problem in which an actual transmission period becomes (excessively) larger than an intended (target) period may be<!-- EPO <DP n="107"> --> alleviated). In another example, when a bitmap having a (specific) predefined (or signaled) length is applied repeatedly, the WAN communication-related DL (time (or frequency)) resource (for example, "DL SF" and/or "(TDD) SPECIAL SF" (and/or "DWPTS")) may be (additionally) excluded (for example, it may be regarded that the (V2X pool-related) "LOGICAL INDEXING" is not performed (or applied) to the corresponding resource excluded (additionally)), and the bitmap may be made to be applied (by taking into account only the WAN communication-related UL (time (or frequency)) resource). Here, the rule may be applied limitedly only to the "IN-COVERAGE" environment (and/or TDD system).</p>
<p id="p0321" num="0321">Referring again to <figref idref="f0034">FIG. 34</figref>, the UE may perform V2X communication on an allocated V2X resource pool S2420. A specific example in which the UE performs V2X communication is the same as described above.</p>
<p id="p0322" num="0322">In one example, the rule may be extended to be applied to the case where (part of) V2X resources (designated by a bitmap) and/or (part of) (periodic) transmission resources reserved (or selected) (by the V2X TX UE(s)) are positioned not only on the WAN communication-related DL (time (or frequency)) resources but also on the resources with which (predefined (or signaled)) V2X communication is not performed properly (for example, (time (or frequency) resource) in addition to "UL SF" (and/or "UPPTS") (and/or a resource having a relatively higher priority (than the priority related to a V2X message to be transmitted) for which a (specific) V2X channel (or signaling) transmission (or reception) is set).</p>
<p id="p0323" num="0323">In another example, the V2X UE(s) (within coverage of an eNB) may be made to transmit an "offset value for the DFN#0 based on GNSS" signaled (or defined) previously (by a (serving) eNB) to other V2X UE(s) (outside the coverage of the eNB) through a predefined channel (for example, PSBCH).<!-- EPO <DP n="108"> --></p>
<p id="p0324" num="0324">In a yet another example, if I_VALUE (range) value and/or "RESOURCE RESERVATION INTERVAL" (range) value selectable (or allowable) on a V2X resource pool (and/or (V2X) carrier) is limited (in the form of "CARRIER(/POOL)-SPECIFIC NETWORK (PRE)CONFIGURATION"), the V2X TX UE(s) may be made, on the corresponding V2X resource pool (and/or (V2X) carrier), to perform a sensing operation (for example, STEP 5 of Table 2) (and/or energy measurement operation (for example, STEP 8 of Table 2)) on the basis of (A) a period value that may be derived (or calculated) from the minimum value <b>(I_MINVAL)</b> of I_VALUE (or maximum value) (or a (specific) I_VALUE predefined (or signaled)) (for example, "I_MINVAL*P_STEP) and/or (B) the minimum (or maximum) period value of "RESOURCE RESERVATION INTERVAL" (or predefined (or signaled)) (specific) "RESOURCE RESERVATION INTERVAL" value). Here, when a specific V2X resource pool is set (or allowed) only for a P-UE(s) performing V2X message transmission with a relatively long period (for example, "500 ms") (compared with the V-UE(s)) and the aforementioned rule is applied, the P-UE(s) performs a sensing operation (and/or energy measurement operation) based on the (corresponding) period (for example, "500 ms").</p>
<p id="p0325" num="0325">Meanwhile, as described above, the UE may select a random value from an interval between 5 and 15 in the case of a relatively long resource reservation period (for example, a resource reservation period longer than 100 ms) (which is called "L_PER") and reserve as many resources as the selected value multiplied by 10. However, applying the resource reservation method described above to the case of using a relatively short resource reservation period (for example, 20 ms or 50 ms (shorter than 100 ms)) (which is called "S_PER") may be inappropriate for an L_PER UE existing in the same resource pool to sense an S_PER UE.</p>
<p id="p0326" num="0326">In this regard, if a (relatively) "SHORTER RESOURCE RESERVATION PERIOD (or INTERVAL)" (for example, "20 ms") is employed in order for a UE to support transmission of<!-- EPO <DP n="109"> --> a V2X message (or traffic) having a (relatively) short period, (part of) the following parameters may be set (or signaled) differently (or independently) (when compared with transmission of a V2X message (or traffic) performed with a (relatively) long period (or a predefined (or signaled) (threshold) period) (for example, "100 ms"). In one example, it may be interpreted that (part of) the following parameters are applied to (A) the case where SHORTP_UE(s) performs a sensing operation and/or (B) the case where LONGP_UE(s) performs a sensing operation (with respect to the SHORTP_UE(s)) (when a V2X UE(s) having a "SHORTER RESOURCE RESERVATION PERIOD (or INTERVAL)" (and/or a V2X UE(s) performing transmission of a V2X message (or traffic) having a (relatively) short period) <b>(SHORTP_UE(s))</b> and a V2X UE(s) having a "(RELATIVELY) LONGER RESOURCE RESERVATION PERIOD (or INTERVAL)" (and/or a V2X UE(s) performing transmission of a V2X message (or traffic) having a (relatively) long period) <b>(LONGP_UE(s))</b> co-exist on a predefined (or signaled) (specific) resource pool). In what follows, the present method will be described with reference to related drawings.</p>
<p id="p0327" num="0327"><figref idref="f0037">FIG. 37</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for performing reservation of a V2X transmission resource when resource reservation is set with a relatively short period (for example, 20 ms or 50 ms (shorter than 100 ms)) according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0328" num="0328">Referring to <figref idref="f0037">FIG. 37</figref>, when resource reservation is set with a relatively short period, the UE may perform reservation of a relatively large number of V2X transmission resources S3710. Here, reserving a relatively large number of V2X transmission resources does not indicate selecting a random number from an interval between 5 and 15 and reserving as many resources as the selected value multiplied by 10 as described above, but indicates that the UE selects a random value from an interval between 5*K (where K is a positive integer larger than or equal to 2) and 15*K and reserves as many resources as the selected value multiplied by 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="110"> --></p>
<p id="p0329" num="0329">In other words, in the case of a relatively short resource reservation period (for example, 20 ms, 50 ms), the aforementioned counter value (a value of 5 or more and 15 or less) is multiplied by 5 or 2, which is further multiplied by 10. Then as many resources as the final multiplication result may be reserved.</p>
<p id="p0330" num="0330">For example, if the resource reservation period is '20 ms', the UE may select a random value from the interval of [5*5, 15*5] (in other words, 5*2 or more and 15*5 or less), and as many resources as the random number multiplied additionally by 10 may be reserved. According to the present example, the UE may reserve more than 250 and less than 750 resources.</p>
<p id="p0331" num="0331">In another example, if the resource reservation period is '50 ms', the UE may select a random value from the interval of [5*2, 15*2], and as many resources as the random number multiplied additionally by 10 may be reserved. According to the present example, the UE may reserve more than 100 and less than 300 resources.</p>
<p id="p0332" num="0332">(Example#1) A finite number of subframes (having a resource reservation (interval) period) assumed (or used) when transmission resource (re) reservation (or selection) is performed (and/or C<sub>resel</sub> value of Table 2 (for example, "[10 * SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER]")). Here, in the case of transmission of a V2X message (or traffic) having a (relatively) short period, the corresponding finite number of subframes (having the resource reservation (interval) period) (and/or the C<sub>resel</sub> value) may be set (or signaled) to have a relatively small number (which, for example, provides an effect of preventing excessive reservation (or selection) of resources from being performed (within a short time period).</p>
<p id="p0333" num="0333">Afterwards, the UE may perform V2X communication on the reserved V2X transmission resource S3720. A specific example in which the UE performs V2X communication on the reserved V2X transmission resource is the same as described above.<!-- EPO <DP n="111"> --></p>
<p id="p0334" num="0334"><figref idref="f0038">FIG. 38</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for performing sensing with a relatively short period when resource reservation with a short period is set according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0335" num="0335">Referring to <figref idref="f0038">FIG. 38</figref>, if resource reservation with a short period is set, the UE performs sensing in a sensing period with a relatively short period to determine a resource with which V2X communication is performed S3810. In other words, as described above, if resource reservation with a short period is set (for example, when resource reservation is set with a period shorter than 100 ms), the sensing (namely S-RSSI measurement) period may be set as a resource reservation period used for transmission by the UE. In other words, if resource reservation is set with a short period, the UE may perform sensing according to the short period used for resource reservation. In what follows, the operation above will be described in more detail.</p>

<p id="p0339" num="0339">As another example, the V2X UE(s) may be made to perform (transmission) resource (re)selection as follows.</p>
<p id="p0340" num="0340">The V2X UE may select a transmission resource by using the following method.</p>
<p id="p0341" num="0341">It is assumed that the UE operates in a mode in which the UE itself performs resource selection. In the aforementioned mode, if resource selection/reselection for V2X message transmission is triggered, the UE may perform sensing and select or reselect a resource on the basis of the sensing result. The UE may transmit scheduling assignment (SA) which indicates the selected or reselected resource.</p>
<p id="p0342" num="0342">For example, at the subframe (which may also be called TTI in the following) #n, resource selection or reselection may be triggered for the UE. Then, the UE may perform sensing between the subframe#n-1 and the subframe#n-b (where a &gt; b &gt; 0, a and b are integer numbers) and select or reselect resources for V2X message transmission on the basis of the sensing result.</p>
<p id="p0343" num="0343">The a and b may be the values set commonly to V2X UEs or the values set independently for individual V2X UEs.</p>
<p id="p0344" num="0344">When the a and b are common to V2X UEs, for example, a relationship such as 'a =<!-- EPO <DP n="113"> --> 1000 + b' may hold. In other words, if the UE is triggered to select a resource for V2X message transmission by itself, the UE may perform a sensing operation for 1 second (1000 ms = 1000 subframes = 1000 TTIs).</p>
<p id="p0345" num="0345">The UE may consider all of SA transmissions decoded over the period starting from the subframe#n-a to the subframe#n-b. The decoded SA may be associated with data transmission over the period starting from the subframe#n-a to the subframe#n-b, where the decoded SA may consider the data transmitted before the subframe#n-a.</p>
<p id="p0346" num="0346">A UE which has failed to perform a sensing operation at the subframe#m may exclude subframes#(m+100*k) from resource selection or reselection (because of such a reason that a signal has to be transmitted from the subframe#m). Meanwhile, the UE may skip the subframes used for transmitting a signal without performing a sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p0347" num="0347">After performing the sensing, the UE may select a time or frequency resource for PSSCH, namely a sidelink data channel.</p>
<p id="p0348" num="0348">The UE may transmit scheduling assignment (SA) from the subframe#n+c. The c is an integer larger than 0, which may be a fixed value or a variable.

The cmin may be a fixed value or set by the network.</p>

<p id="p0361" num="0361"><b>[Proposed Rule#10]</b> In one example, according to the 'LATENCY (or QoS) REQUIREMENT' (and/or 'PRIORITY' and/or 'SERVICE TYPE') of a (generated) packet (to be transmitted), it may be interpreted as '(D or C - M)' ((maximum (or minimum)) range) (which, for example, may be interpreted as 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)') (for example, 'M' is a '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or the time point at which a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) (on the 'PDCP LAYER') arrives (or is received) (or the time point at which a packet (or message) is generated); also, (here) 'D (or C)' wording may indicate that a resource (re)selection (or reservation) operation is triggered (exceptionally) differently (which, for example, may be regarded as the transmission time point of (initial) data (PSSCH) (or control information (PSCCH)) after SUBFRAME#N). In another example, the 'C' and/or 'D' ((maximum (or minimum)) range) (which, for example, may be interpreted as 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION<!-- EPO <DP n="116"> --> (or RANGE or WINDOW)') has to be determined to satisfy (or by taking into account) the 'LATENCY (or QoS) REQUIREMENT' which may differ according to the 'SERVICE TYPE' (and/or 'PRIORITY LEVEL'). Here, the 'UPPER LIMIT (or LOWER BOUND)' of 'C' and/or 'D' (which, for example, may be interpreted as 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)') may not be fixed. Here, the corresponding 'UPPER LIMIT (or LOWER BOUND)' may be set (or signaled) differently according to 'PRIORITY LEVEL' (and/or 'SERVICE TYPE' and/or 'LATENCY (or QoS) REQUIREMENT'). Here, if a currently selected 'D' value (or 'SUBFRAME#D') has a problem in satisfying the 'LATENCY (or QoS) REQUIREMENT' of a newly arrived (or generated (or received)) packet (or message), a (transmission) resource (re)selection operation may be triggered. In one example, the maximum (and/or minimum) or range (which, for example, may be interpreted as 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)') of the 'D' (and/or 'C') value may be determined by taking into account the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or the time point at which a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) (on the 'PDCP LAYER') arrives (or is received) (or the time point at which a packet (or message) is generated) ('M') and/or the time point at which the (transmission) resource (re)selection operation is triggered (as a predefined (or signaled) condition is satisfied) ('N') and/or 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' ('L') (for example, '100 ms') and/or 'PPPP' of a packet (or message) (for example, when a (partially) different 'PPPP' value is set (or allowed) for each packet (or message) of different 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT'). As one specific example, the maximum (and/or minimum) value of 'D' (and/or 'C') may be determined by '(LABS(M-N))' or 'MIN(L, (L-ABS(M-N)))' (where, for example, 'MIN(X, Y)' and 'ABS(Z)' represent a function returning the minimum value between 'X' and 'Y' and a function returning the absolute value of 'Z', respectively) or the range of 'D' (and/or 'C') may be designated by '(L-ABS(M-N)) &lt; D(/C) &lt; 100 (or 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT')' (or '(L-ABS(M-N)) ≤<!-- EPO <DP n="117"> --> D(/C) ≤ 100 (or 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT')'). In one example, considering retransmission of a specific (one) 'TB (or packet or message)', when the maximum value (and/or minimum value) of 'D' (and/or 'C') value is calculated (or determined), a predefined (or signaled) 'MARGIN (or OFFSET)' value <b>('MAG_VAL')</b> may have to be subtracted from the 'L' value. When the corresponding rule is applied, the maximum (and/or minimum value) of 'D' (and/or 'C') value may be determined as '((L-MAG_VAL) - ABS(M-N))' or 'MIN((L - MAG_VAL), ((L - MAG_VAL) - ABS(M-N)))'. Here, the 'MAG_VAL' value may have 'DEPENDENCY' on the number of retransmissions (for example, the 'MAG_VAL' value is increased as the number of retransmissions is increased). The rule may be applied limitedly only for a case where the '(transmission) resource (re)selection operation' is triggered (according as a (predefined (or signaled)) condition is satisfied), and a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) exists on the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or 'PDCP LAYER') (or when a packet (or message) is generated). In another example, when a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) does not exist on the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or 'PDCP LAYER') although the '(transmission) resource (re)selection operation' is triggered (according as a (predefined (or signaled)) condition is satisfied) (or when there is no generated packet (or message)), the (transmission) resource (re)selection operation may be performed by assuming (or considering) that '(N = M)' (which, for example, may be interpreted that the time at which the (transmission) resource (re)selection option is triggered ('N') is assumed (or considered) to be the time ('M') at which a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) is received on the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or 'PDCP LAYER')) or by deferring the (transmission) resource (re)selection operation until a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) arrives (or is received) actually on the 'PDCP LAYER' (or until a packet (or message) is actually generated) or by assuming that a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) has arrived (or has been received) (or exists) on the 'PDCP LAYER' (previously including (or<!-- EPO <DP n="118"> --> not including) the 'N' time point) (or a packet (or message) has been generated). As another example, subsequent resources including (or not including) the time point corresponding to the maximum value (for example, '(L-ABS(M-N))', '100 (or 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT')') of the (aforementioned) 'D' (and/or 'C') are assumed (or considered) as unavailable and may be made to be excluded (from (re)selectable candidate resources) (on the 'STEP 3 (or 2)'). In an additional example, resources at the time point (for example, resources before the time point including (or not including) '(C + C_MIN)' (or resources between 'N' time point and '(C+C_MIN)' time point (here, in one example, the resources corresponding to the 'N' time point and '(C+C_MIN)' time point may be included (or may not be included)))) corresponding to the minimum value <b>(C_MIN)</b> (for example, the 'minimum value' may be determined (for example, '4 ms') by taking into account the 'PROCESSING TIME' of the UE) of 'C' (and/or 'D') (where, for example, the time point 'C' may be interpreted as the time point at which transmission of the (first) control (or scheduling) information (PSCCH) is performed after the (transmission) resource (re)selection operation is triggered ('N')) is assumed (or considered) to be unavailable and may be made to be excluded from (re)selectable candidate resources (on 'STEP 2 (or 3)'). In a still another example, according to (part of) the proposed rule of the present invention (for example, [Proposed Rule#1] and [Proposed Rule#10]), when the 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)' ((maximum (or minimum) range) is set (or changed) differently by taking into account 'PRIORITY LEVEL' (and/or 'SERVICE TYPE' and/or 'LATENCY (or QoS) REQUIREMENT'), the following (partial) parameters related to the sensing operation (and/or (transmission) resource (re)selection (or reservation) operation (and/or V2X message transmission)) according to whether a predefined condition is satisfied. Here, the (corresponding) condition may be defined as (A) the case in which a V2X message with the 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' shorter (or longer) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold is transmitted (and/or the case in<!-- EPO <DP n="119"> --> which a V2X message with the 'PPPP' higher (or lower) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold is transmitted), and/or (B) the case in which a number of (selectable) (candidate) resources (for example, subframes) less (or more) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold exist (or remain) within the 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)' (and/or the case in which the minimum (or maximum) value of the 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW) is smaller (or larger) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value.</p>

Here, in the case of transmission based on a high (or low) PPPP value (or range), whether a resource employed by other UE for the corresponding transmission is selectable (or IDLE or BUSY) is determined on the basis of a relatively low (or high) PSSCH-RSRP threshold value (and/or in the case of a V2X message having the 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' longer (or shorter) than predefined (or signaled) threshold, even if the 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' has the same PPPP value (or range), by setting (or signaling) a relatively low (or high) PSSCH-RSRP threshold value, V2X message transmission having the 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' shorter (or longer) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value may be secured). And/or when the minimum ratio (or number) of candidate (transmission) resources that need to be remained (and/or the corresponding ratio (or number) of remaining candidate (transmission) resources) is smaller than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value after the candidate (transmission) resource exclusion operation based on a sensing operation execution interval (or period) and/or a ((maximum (or minimum)) period (or range) from which a candidate (transmission) resource may be selected (SELECTION WINDOW) and/or a range from which a random value is determined (or<!-- EPO <DP n="120"> --> selected) to define a maintenance interval of a (re)selected (or reserved) resource (and/or a coefficient multiplied to the corresponding selected random value (for deriving the C<sub>RESEL</sub> value [1/2/3]) and/or resource reservation period and/or PSSCH-RSRP threshold value, when the minimum ratio (or number) of candidate (transmission) resources that needs to be remained after the candidate (transmission) resource exclusion operation based on the offset value added to the (related) PSSCH-RSRP threshold value and/or S-RSSI is smaller than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value, when a V2X message having the 'LATENCY REQUIREMENT' shorter (or longer than) a (predefined (or signaled) threshold value), for example, is transmitted, (and/or a V2X message having the 'PPPP' higher (or lower) than a predefined (or signaled threshold value is transmitted and/or when a number of (selectable) (candidate) resources less (or more) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold exist (or remain) within the 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)' and/or when the minimum (or maximum value) of the 'TX RESOURCE (RE)SELECTION DURATION (or RANGE or WINDOW)' is smaller (or larger) than a predefined (or signaled) threshold, when (A) the minimum ratio (or the minimum number) of candidate (transmission) resources that have to be remained after a candidate (transmission) resource exclusion operation based on the PSSCH-RSRP threshold value is performed and/or (B) the ratio (or the number) of the corresponding remaining candidate (transmission) resources is smaller than a predefined (or signaled) threshold value, the minimum ratio (or the minimum number) of candidate (transmission) resources that have to be remained after the candidate (transmission) resource exclusion operation based on the offset value added to the (related) PSSCH-RSRP threshold value and/or (C) S-RSSI is performed may be set to a relatively high value (which, for example, brings an effect of relieving the increase of probability of collision).

In one example, when it is difficult for the V2X TX UE(s) to accurately predict (its) V2X MESSAGE generation period as the V2X MESSAGE generation period is changed according to the predefined parameter (for example, velocity or amount of (movement) direction change), it may not be efficient to reserve a (future) resource according to the method.

Here, by applying a predefined (or signaled) different offset value to the "DM-RS POWER/ENERGY MEASUREMENT" value related to the HARD_RSC and SOFT_RSC of other V2X TX UE(s) (determined from SA decoding), the V2X TX UE(s) may determine whether the HARD_RSC and SOFT_RSC are selectable candidate resources or resources to be excluded (STEP 2 of Table 2). Here, the HARD_RSC related offset value (for example, it is assumed as a "negative integer") may be set (or signaled) larger (or smaller) than that of the SOFT_RSC (for example, it may be interpreted that the HARD_RSC is protected with a relatively high priority compared with the SOFT_RSC). Here, only the offset value with respect to the SOFT_RSC (or HARD_RSC)-related "DM-RS POWER/ENERGY MEASUREMENT" value may be set (or signaled).

When the V2X TX UE(s) selects (or reserves) SA TX-related resources, with respect to the SA transmission resource(s) associated with the data transmission(s) on the HARD_RSC and SOFT_RSC of other V2X TX UE(s) (determined from SA decoding), by applying a predefined (or signaled) different "DM-RS POWER/ENERGY MEASUREMENT" threshold value (in the same manner), the V2X TX UE(s) may be made to<!-- EPO <DP n="126"> --> determine whether the HARD_RSC and SOFT_RSC are selectable (SA) candidate resources or (SA) resources to be excluded. Here, (A) the "TIME GAP" (range) between the SA transmission time and the associated data transmission time may be set (or signaled) differently according to in which resource type (for example HARD_RSC and SOFT_RSC) the corresponding data is transmitted and/or (B) data related (transmission) power value (or (transmission) power control parameter) transmitted through a different resource type (and/or (maximum allowable) MSC value) may be set (or signaled) differently (or independently). In one example, the V2X message transmission period of the PEDESTRIAN UE (P-UE) (for example, "1000 ms") may be set (or signaled) to be relatively long compared with that of a VEHICLE UE (V-UE) (for example, "100 ms") (by taking into account the relatively low movement speed and/or a need for battery saving). Here, when the P-UE transmits a V2X message, the "I" value on the SA field is made to indicate a predefined (or signaled) specific value (or "RESERVED STATE") and therefore, other V2X RX UE(s) may be made to interpret that (A) the (corresponding) SA (and/or associated data) transmission has been performed by the P-UE and/or (B) to interpret that the (scheduled) resource based on SA has been reserved with a predefined (or signaled) (different) period (relatively long (compared to the case of a V-UE).</p>

In one example, although the present invention describes the proposed methods on the basis of the 3GPP LTE system for the convenience of descriptions, the range of systems to which the proposed methods are applied may be expanded to include other systems in addition to the 3GPP LTE system. As one example, the proposed methods of the present invention may be extended to be applied for D2D communication. Here, in one example, D2D communication refers to communication performed by a UE directly to other UE using a radio channel, where in this example, the UE means a terminal of the user; however, when a network device such as an eNB transmits or receives a signal to and from a UE according to a communication method, the eNB may also be regarded as a kind of UE. Also, as one example, the proposed methods of the present invention may be applied limitedly only to the MODE 2 V2X operation (and/or MODE 1 V2X operation). Also, in one example, the proposed methods of the present invention may be applied limitedly only for a case where the '(transmission) resource (re)selection operation' is triggered (according as a (predefined (or signaled)) condition is satisfied), and a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) exists on the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or 'PDCP LAYER') (or when a packet (or message) is generated) (and/or when a (generated) packet (or message) (to be transmitted) does not exist on the '(LOW LAYER) buffer' (and/or 'PDCP LAYER') (or when a packet (or message) is not generated)).
