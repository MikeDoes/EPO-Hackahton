<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention is related to a multirotor aircraft comprising a plurality of thrust producing units, each thrust producing unit of the plurality of thrust producing units comprising at least one rotor assembly and a shrouding. The prior art is illustrated by documents <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7712701B1"><text>US-B1-7712701</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2193993A2"><text>EP-A2-2193993</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US8167234B1"><text>US-B1 -8167234</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Aircrafts are generally equipped with one or more thrust producing units that are provided for producing thrust in a predetermined direction during operation of the aircraft. In general, each thrust producing unit includes one or more rotors or propellers, which are frequently enclosed in an associated duct or shroud in order to increase a respectively produced thrust of a given thrust producing unit at constant required power. Thus, a respective rotor or propeller induced velocity can be used to generate thrust also from the duct or shroud.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In general, ducts or shrouds are defined by enclosed, annular surfaces that are arranged around associated rotors or propellers in order to improve respective aerodynamics and performances of the associated rotors or propellers. In addition, such ducts or shrouds are provided for protecting respective rotor or propeller blades of the associated rotors or propellers from undesired impacts during flight, such as e. g. bird strikes, as well as on ground or during hovering in very low distance to ground, where close obstacles on ground could be hit. Accordingly, such ducts or shrouds are usually confronted with the following problems: robustness, damage tolerance, weight, stiffness, strength and stability, integration, noise reduction, as well as production costs and manufacturability.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Robustness and damage tolerance are problems that arise from the fact that by definition at least a part of a respective surface of a given duct or shroud is usually located at an outer surface, i. e. on the exterior of a given aircraft. This outer surface,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> however, may be subjected to accidental damaging due to incorrect handling, inappropriate maintenance and misuse, as well as due to harsh environmental conditions, such as hail, bird, or debris impacts. Accordingly, robustness and damage tolerance are one of the main design and weight drivers in the development of ducts or shrouds, especially when using composite parts.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">An additional requirement with respect to robustness and damage tolerance emanates from the fact that usually a very small gap between a respective duct surface and associated rotor blades of a given rotor or propeller that is arranged in the duct or shroud is required to increase an underlying aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor or propeller. However, for load cases inducing a high deformation due to respectively applied loads, this gap between the rotor blades and the duct surface may decrease and even become zero, or in extreme cases the rotor blades may even hit and, consequently, damage the duct surface.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The weight, stiffness, strength and stability problems are mainly associated with a possible loading of a given duct or shroud due to an aerodynamic pressure, as the ducts or shrouds are lift creating/increasing elements. These loads, which may also be referred to as "aerodynamic loads", are surface loads which may sum up to significant lift forces in total. In addition, these aerodynamic loads have to be reacted at respective interfaces where a given duct or shroud is attached to an airframe of a given aircraft.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">More specifically, on the one hand stiffness and stability are mandatory for a duct or shroud in order to enable provision of a geometric shape that is required for a respective aerodynamic flow and to enable provision of a required clearance between respective rotor blades of the rotor or propeller and an associated duct surface. On the other hand, an underlying mass of the duct or<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> shroud should preferably be minimized, although especially for complex shapes and curved load paths in structures, large parts, which mostly suffer from local instability, usually show considerably high deformations. For those structures or geometries, which usually show a high surface-to-volume ratio, conventional lightweight designs such as stringers, beads or sandwich structures are comparatively inefficient, especially if additional requirements such as e. g. the robustness, integration and cost-effective production are applied.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The problem of integration is based on the fact that generally highly loaded and comparatively big structural parts are difficult to integrate. More specifically, in case of a duct or shroud installation, respective mainly loaded elements, such as the duct or shroud itself and an associated structure that is provided for taking over occurring engine and rotor loads, are in general geometrically intersecting. This is particularly relevant if a given duct or shroud is additionally supported not only by a single motor beam, but also by additional stator beams. Therefore, this usually leads in conventional designs to a considerable weight increase, as reinforcements at respective intersecting areas are required in order to cope with local weakening of the cross-sections.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, installation of electrical harnesses, cooling pipes and other equipment in a given duct or shroud is another aspect related to the problem of integration. In analogy to provisions required for primary structures, an underlying main load path of the given duct or shroud must frequently be cut for cable routings etc. Harnesses are usually also running inside of a respective structure of the given duct or shroud for aerodynamic and safety reasons. This makes the installation of cables and cable routings as well as harnesses even more difficult, as the accessibility is usually limited, so that the problem of integration is amplified.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The problem of noise reduction is generally based on the fact that rotors and propellers, especially when operated in counter rotating mode, create a significant level of noise which is nowadays a critical topic for certification and customer acceptance. In this respect, it should be noted that conventional ducts or shrouds are usually designed as rigid load carrying structural items in order to enable an improved rigidity and strength. However, the requirement of rigidity and strength usually is in conflict with noise reduction efforts, where normally soft surfaces with dampening properties are preferred.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, production costs and manufacturability are problems that consist in the requirement of providing a highly efficient duct or shroud in general. Therefore, an underlying duct or shroud design is usually based on a freeform, or at least a double curved path, whose outer surface must be stiffened in order to provide a required stiffness at least in terms of buckling. However, particularly for aerospace grade parts that are manufactured mostly in rather small aerospace lot sizes, this requirement results in high production costs. In addition, integration of harnesses as described above, which is typically made in a respective assembly line, further drives underlying production costs up.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Conventional ducts or shrouds generally cope with one or more of the above-described problems. However, there is currently no concept available that is suitable to cope with all of the above-described problems.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">More specifically, conventional ducts or shrouds are usually provided with a stiff outer skin that is either stiffened by an internal framework, such as a conventional frame-stringer system, or by beads, or by being implemented as a sandwich design where the outer skin is part of an underlying load carrying structure. A respective outer surface of the stiff outer skin usually serves as a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> load carrying structure apart from a respective "running surface" of the rotor or propeller, where usually an ablative, non-load carrying layer is applied.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The conventional ducts or shrouds are, thus, implemented based on a design principle that is well-known for aviation primary structural elements in general, i. e. not only for ducts or shrouds, but also for fuselages and wings of aircrafts. This well-known design principle that somewhat defines a "standard" design concept offers in most areas of application a comparatively effective structure, as it enables a comparatively efficient utilization of material and, in most cases, a satisfactory moment of inertia.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Nevertheless, this design principle has already been developed almost one century ago for fuselage and wing structures and was optimized since then only for this area of application. In parallel, needs of structural components that are required for manufacturing ducts or shrouds and which are usually currently used in manufacturing of ducts and shrouds, were merely copied from these design principles and transferred resp. translated to manufacturing of individual duct geometries, which were to be implemented, but the design principle as such was not optimized with respect to manufacturing of ducts or shrouds. However, as described above, all problems related to underlying requirements of ducts or shrouds result in a significantly more complex optimization task and leads, thus, to a redefinition of an "optimized" design principle for ducts or shrouds. This is the reason why conventional ducts or shrouds merely cope with part of the above-described problems, but not with all of these problems.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Even in currently advancing multicopter developments, where ducted or shrouded rotors or propellers are applied, respective design principles of given ducts or shrouds are neglected, as an underlying design focus is mostly related to an overall vehicle<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> architecture. This likewise applies to ducts or shrouds of other aircrafts, such as e. g. so-called Fenestron ducts or shrouds in helicopters, or turbine engine ducts or shrouds in airplanes or convertiplanes, or ducted fans in e. g. landing craft air cushions, which are all well-known applications. This likewise applies to still other currently suggested duct or shroud designs, such as e. g. in ducts or shrouds of currently occurring exoskeletons or other aerospace fans, which are also well-known ducts or shrouds.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Independent of the above-described ducts or shrouds, the prior art also describes application of foam to structural load carrying elements. By way of example, the document <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5642982A"><text>US 5,642,982</text></patcit> describes a variable diameter rotor with rotor blades that comprise a movable outboard blade section which telescopes over an inboard blade section along an associated longitudinal axis. The outboard blade section includes a spar member which is enveloped by a leading-edge shaft and a foam-filled trailing edge pocket assembly to define a requisite aerodynamic contour of the outboard blade section. In other words, the foam-filled trailing edge pocket assembly defines a load carrying outer surface element, wherein foam is included. This component is, however, merely placed at the trailing edge of a given rotor blade.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The document <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2008003330A1"><text>WO 2008/003330 A1</text></patcit> describes a deformable trailing edge section of a wind turbine blade. The deformable trailing edge section is formed in a deformable material, in particular foam. In other words, the portion of the wind turbine blade that is formed with the foam is provided for being deformable, i. e. weak. A similar structure is described in the document <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="RU66301U1"><text>RU 66301 U1</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">The document <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="DE7912264U1"><text>DE 79 12 264 U1</text></patcit> describes, in contrast thereto, an aft portion of a car having a load carrying structure that<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> defines an aerodynamic surface and that is partly surrounded by a secondary structure made of foam.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The document <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US7712701B1"><text>US 7 712 701 B1</text></patcit> describes an unmanned aerial vehicle having counterrotating ducted rotors that are driven by electric motors. The unmanned aerial vehicle is configured as a modular system, which enhances portability by humans and allows repair and refit of the unmanned aerial vehicle that is tailored for a particular application. The unmanned aerial vehicle includes a shroud that is concentric about an axis, with the shroud including a plurality of shroud sections each of which is separately detachable from the unmanned aerial vehicle. Each shroud section forms a module that contains elements used in an operation of the unmanned aerial vehicle. Each shroud section is made from durable, lightweight material. The shroud sections are designed to be non-destructively detachably connected to a frame to allow disassembly of the vehicle to increase portability, and to allow shroud sections to be removed and replaced by other shroud sections or to be repaired.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The document <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="DE965621C"><text>DE 965 621 C</text></patcit> describes a transverse body, in particular a tubular wing. The transverse body comprises an inner and an outer wall which are subjected to a flow, particularly a gas flow. The transverse body comprises a supporting skeleton, which is preferably made of metal, and a light and rigid filling material. When both inner and outer walls of the transverse body are curved, the skeleton is completely covered by the filling material.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The document <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO2014120019A1"><text>WO 2014/120019 A1</text></patcit> describes propulsion units for propulsion and manoeuvring of a maritime vessel. A leading edge on an inlet of a nozzle of the propulsion units is exchangeable, so that a hydrodynamic shape of the leading edge can be changed due to operating profiles or damages. The leading edge is formed by a metallic front ring being integrated with stays<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for supporting a propeller section. The leading edge further includes a sectioned part which forms the hydrodynamic shape of the inlet. The sectioned part is formed by a low-weight non-metallic material. The metallic front ring is arranged between a main part of the nozzle and the sectioned part forming the hydrodynamic shape of the inlet. The leading edge section parts are shaped in such a way as to allow for arrangement to the metallic front ring and for providing a smooth curved surface from an outer to an inner surface of the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The document <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP2193993A2"><text>EP 2 193 993 A2</text></patcit> describes an unmanned aerial vehicle that is capable of vertical take-offs and landings with one or more ducted fans as a propulsion system. The unmanned aerial vehicle comprises ducted fan assemblies that are interconnected via a duct linkage assembly. Each ducted fan assembly includes a lightweight aerodynamic duct lip that is structurally supported by a structurally rigid duct ring extending around an outer circumference of the duct lip.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">In summary, although the above-described prior art is related to various different ducts or shrouds and although various different materials are known in the art that are used with aerodynamic structures in general, underlying design principles are not readily available for implementing an improved duct or shroud for interacting with a rotor or propeller in an aircraft. In particular, the prior art does not describe any combination of materials and/or design principles that allow to create a duct or shroud that copes at least with most of the above-described problems.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new multirotor aircraft comprising a plurality of thrust producing units, each thrust producing unit of the plurality of thrust producing units comprising at least one rotor assembly and a shrouding for interacting with the at least one rotor assembly, wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> shrouding is suitable to overcome the above-described drawbacks at least mostly.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">This object is solved by a multirotor aircraft comprising a plurality of thrust producing units, each thrust producing unit of the plurality of thrust producing units being inclined in a lateral direction of the multirotor aircraft and comprising at least one rotor assembly, and a shrouding. The shrouding is surrounding the rotor assembly in circumferential direction and forms an air duct that is associated with the at least one rotor assembly and axially delimited by an air inlet region and an air outlet region. A main aerodynamic load carrying primary structure and a stiffening secondary structure that completely encapsulates the main aerodynamic load carrying primary structure are provided. The stiffening secondary structure comprises at least one inflexible lightweight volume material and is provided at least for reducing elastic movements of the main aerodynamic load carrying primary structure under loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">It should be noted that the term "shrouding" should be understood as encompassing simultaneously the terms "duct" and "shroud". In other words, in the context of the present invention, the term "shrouding" refers interchangeably to a duct or a shroud.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The main load carrying primary structure can be made of any suitable material, such as e. g. metal, plastic, and/or fiber reinforced polymers. The main load carrying primary structure advantageously defines a main load path for lifting forces, in particular aerodynamic lifting forces, and provides a global stiffness of the shrouding. On top this main load carrying primary structure carries bending and torsional loads that occur in response to aerodynamic loads, gravity and inertia forces.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The stiffening secondary structure is a structure that completely surrounds the main load carrying primary structure and that is made of any suitable non-flexible respectively inflexible, e. g. rigid lightweight volume material, such as e. g. foam, gradient foam, balsa wood and so on. The stiffening secondary structure advantageously provides an actual aerodynamic and functional outer volume of the inventive shrouding up until a respective outer surface thereof. An important feature of the rigid lightweight volume material is its inflexibility, as one of its main functions is to provide enough stiffness for the main load carrying primary structure. Thus, any out-of-plane deformation that is perpendicular to the outer surface of the main load carrying primary structure is at least hindered. This is advantageous for suppressing any elastic secondary deformation so that an occurring overall deformation of the inventive shrouding as such is comparatively low.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Advantageously, aerodynamic loads that are acting on the inventive shrouding under loading conditions are acting directly on an outer surface of the inventive shrouding and the inflexible lightweight volume material transfers these aerodynamic loads to the main load carrying primary structure. By their nature, aerodynamic loads are locally rather low, but generally sum up to comparatively big magnitudes on the complete outer surface of the stiffening secondary structure as a resulting force. Therefore, an underlying design principle of the inventive shrouding consists in choosing a relative stiffness of the inflexible lightweight volume material's Young's moduli in a way that the main load carrying primary structure is stiff compared to any secondary structural items, i. e. in particular the stiffening secondary structure.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferably, the main load carrying primary structure and/or the stiffening secondary structure is "sealed" or enclosed by a completely non-load carrying layer, such as a foil or surface finish,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> in order to protect the inflexible lightweight volume material or to achieve a desired dedicated surface state with respect to hardness, smoothness, water tightness, micro-structure for influencing a respective airflow through the inventive shrouding, porosity for dedicated acoustic noise influencing, and so on.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The main load carrying primary structure of the inventive shrouding is completely encapsulated resp. surrounded by a non-load carrying secondary structure, i. e. the stiffening secondary structure, which provides protection of the main load carrying primary structure. Thus, a comparatively high damage tolerance can be achieved, as even if the stiffening secondary structure is completely broken and/or damaged, there would be no detrimental effect on the main load carrying primary structure itself. Consequently, even if the complete stiffening secondary structure is broken, e. g. because of a damage case, or in an extreme scenario fully removed from the main load carrying primary structure, there is no impact on a respective main load path.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">The inflexible lightweight volume material of the stiffening secondary structure that completely encapsulates the main load carrying primary structure provides, due to its comparatively low stiffness, a comparatively "soft" member that is suitable to dissipate energy in case of an undesired impact, e. g. if an obstacle is hit by the inventive shrouding, e. g. during hovering with low forward, backward, or sideward speed in case that the inventive shrouding is used with an aircraft. This "soft" member reduces respective peak forces of such an impact significantly and increases a respective area of contact at the same time. Consequently, any effect resulting from hitting the obstacle is advantageously minimized and spread to a bigger area at the same time, which makes the impact much less severe, increases safety,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and offers weight saving opportunities due to reduced stress levels and energy absorption. This is also valid for bird strike scenarios.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, the main load carrying primary structure cannot be damaged in everyday use, so that the common sizing criteria, which takes scratches, barely visible impact damages, corrosion etc. into account, may simply be skipped. As a result, respective limits of material strength can be reached much closer. This, again, results in a beneficial weight saving.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Advantageously, the main load path of the main load carrying primary structure is arranged together with the load carrying structure of the thrust producing unit, i. e. an associated motor/rotor/propeller system in a way that both structural items do not intersect and, thus, no complex interfaces or structural reinforcements need to be provided. This simplifies adaptions of an underlying design principle and provides more space for system installation. Furthermore, this improves accessibility for included wirings, routings, and so on.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">Advantageously, the stiffening secondary structure may even be manufactured out of separated sections, which may then be assembled without any structural connection. Thus, smaller manufacturing machines can be used and smaller raw material sizes can be ordered and are required. Consequently, a respective handling can be simplified, which also reduces costs.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The outer surface of the inventive shrouding may be provided such that it exhibits a defined porosity, micro-structure, smoothness, and so on. Thus, a respective aerodynamic noise resulting from rotor or propeller tips of a rotor or propeller arranged within the inventive shrouding, or a respective air flow created at an inner surface of the shrouding, can be controlled and/or reduced in a suitable manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Advantageously, an underlying shape of the main load carrying primary structure, which is in general costly, can be adapted to any convenient cost-saving shape, i. e. using benefits from rotational symmetry, circular shapes instead of complex shapes of any geometry, and so on. Respective smaller parts are simpler in handling and exhibit reduced weights and size, and can be exchanged respectively replaced more easily during corresponding manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">In summary, as no barely visible damages to the main load carrying primary structure may occur, underlying inspection intervals can be prolonged, thus, resulting in decreased maintenance cost. Furthermore, any repair of a possible damage in the stiffening secondary structure is generally cheaper than a structural repair of the main load carrying primary structure. As almost all damages on the inflexible lightweight volume material of the stiffening secondary structure may be regarded as cosmetic, only very limited design and stress support is necessary for inservice repairs.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">Moreover, on top changes of an overall outer aerodynamic shape of the inventive shrouding are related to its outer shape, i. e. to the stiffening secondary structure, and advantageously do not affect the main load carrying primary structure. This simplifies the implementation of late changes of the inventive shrouding during implementation in a respective development phase and even provides space for customer adaptations of future improvements of the aerodynamic shape. In this way, a separation between outer shape of the stiffening secondary structure and the main load carrying primary structure even allows to decouple the outer shape of the stiffening secondary structure from its function as structural element. This is e. g. particularly advantageous for enabling a simplified testing phase during a flight test campaign, when a best<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> outer aerodynamic shape has to be found and to be integrated/tested quickly.</p>

Nevertheless, for simplicity and clarity of the drawings, the rotor assembly 7d is not shown in <figref idref="f0003">Figure 5</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p>

More specifically, the shrouding 6d preferably comprises a main load carrying primary structure 16 and a stiffening secondary structure 17. According to an embodiment that is not covered by the claimed invention, the stiffening secondary structure 17 encapsulates the main load carrying primary structure 16 at least partly.

<p id="p0084" num="0084">More generally, the shrouding 6b preferably exhibits an architecture that is based on a "multi-layer" design by providing at least two separate layers in radial direction of the shrouding 6d. This architecture of the shrouding 6d is particularly beneficial in aircraft applications, where the rotor assembly 7d of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref> is associated with the shrouding 6d and wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> shrouding 6d is used with the thrust producing unit 3d of the aircraft 1 of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref>.</p>

A respective cross-sectional shape of the shrouding 6d can be selected arbitrarily, i. e. be of any shape, or can even be composed of several independent cross-sections. These cross-sections may have rotational symmetry along the circumference of the shrouding 6d, or not. Furthermore, the shrouding must not necessarily have a closed shape in circumferential direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Figure 5</figref>, but may even be opened e. g. at its trailing edge 18b.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">In general, a main geometric characteristic of the shrouding 6d is by definition and function its curved or preferentially almost circular shape around the rotor assembly 7d of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref> and its task of transferring mainly lifting loads to at least one dedicated load introduction point at the fuselage 2 of the aircraft 1 of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref>, which is defined by the structural support 4d, or a respective payload compartment structural component which needs to be lifted. The curved shape of the shrouding 6d under loading conditions is, in consequence, subjected to bending and torsion loads. These loads and, even more, a respective load combination leads from a structure-mechanic point of view to a comparatively compliant mechanical system for reacting/transferring loads, as it generates a comparatively high deformation as elastic movement due to the applied loads. But especially when the shrouding 6d is used together with the rotor assembly 7d in an aircraft application, this kind of curved bending/torsion loaded structural component is required to be as rigid as possible due to aerodynamic requirements: the smaller a<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> respective gap between tips of rotor blades of the rotor assembly 7d are with respect to the air duct 15, the more efficient the air duct 15 works in terms of generating lift force in combination with the rotor assembly 7d. But the more efficient this air duct 15 works, the more loads are applied to the air duct 15 and the bigger are respective elastic deformations under these loading conditions. If, e. g. the elastic secondary deformation of the air duct 15 under load is too big, the tips of the rotor assembly 7d may touch the shrouding 6d and either damage the shrouding 6d or get damaged themselves. Especially in case of an unintended contact with any static obstacle, e. g. with a pillar close to a respective landing side, or a bird strike during flight, the shrouding 6d is exposed to extreme loads and, consequently, extreme deformations which lead to an even bigger threat at first for the shrouding 6d, secondly the rotor blades of the rotor assembly 7d and finally to the aircraft 1 of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">It should be noted that all described scenarios are not only very costly in repair, but can also lead to a dangerous or even hazardous situation for the aircraft 1 of <figref idref="f0001 f0002">Figure 1 to Figure 4</figref> in a worst-case situation. Consequently, a conventional aerodynamically efficient shrouding is usually very heavy and has a complex shape due to aerodynamic needs and, in consequence leads to a massive and expensive design and/or is inefficient, in contrast to the shrouding 6d.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">As already described above, the function of the shrouding 6d is to make the rotor assembly 7d more efficient and/or to generate additional lift in general. In addition thereto, its secondary function consists in protecting the rotor assembly 7d in case of unintended contact with any obstacle, and also to reduce produced noise.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Therefore, the main load carrying primary structure 16 is arranged inside of an outer aerodynamic<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> surface of the shrouding 6d, which is formed by the stiffening secondary structure 17. The cross-section of both, i. e. the main load carrying primary structure 16 and the air duct 15 that is defined by the stiffening secondary structure 17 can be of any shape. The space between the main load carrying primary structure 16 and the outer aerodynamic surface of the shrouding 6d is filled with the inflexible lightweight volume material (17a in <figref idref="f0004">Figure 7</figref>), which must not be soft or highly elastic, but as stiff or rigid as possible as it serves for the main load carrying primary structure 16 as a kind of support to reduce secondary elastic movements of the main load carrying primary structure 16 in radial direction of the shrouding 6d. Therefore, the inflexible lightweight volume material (17a in <figref idref="f0004">Figure 7</figref>) must be connected to the main load carrying primary structure 16 such that the elastic movement of the main load carrying primary structure 16 under loading conditions, i. e. mainly perpendicular to the outer aerodynamic surface of the shrouding 6d, is decreased as far as possible. This may e. g. be achieved by structural bonding, co-bonding, welding, in-situ application of the inflexible lightweight volume material (17a in <figref idref="f0004">Figure 7</figref>) or the main load carrying primary structure 16, respectively, or by any other way of fixing the inflexible lightweight volume material (17a in <figref idref="f0004">Figure 7</figref>) to the main load carrying primary structure 16 such that normal shear loads can be transferred.</p>

<p id="p0127" num="0127">Finally, it should be noted that modifications of the above described aspects of the present invention are also within the common knowledge of the person skilled in the art. These modifications, provided that they are covered by the wording of the appended claims, also form of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p0128" num="0128">For instance, if a very smooth and clean outer surface of the shrouding of the thrust producing unit is required, such a smooth surface can e. g. be achieved by using an inflexible lightweight volume gradient material with decreased porosity close to the outer surface resp. skin, i. e. a material with so-called gradient density, or an inflexible lightweight volume material with two or more different properties, such as e. g. different densities, porosity, stiffnesses, etc. can be used. Thus, in specific applications a separate inner volume material and another outer volume material as e. g. illustrated in <figref idref="f0009">Figure 14</figref> can be used. Alternatively, such a smooth skin can be provided with micro-holes, e. g. by means of drilling, which open the outer surface to inner cavities to reduce noise.</p>
<p id="p0129" num="0129">In other words, the inflexible lightweight volume material that is preferably used should comprise a comparatively low density or a certain porosity, and as it is by definition not in a respective primary load path of the shrouding and, thus, not load carrying, it normally exhibits a high damping factor and/or noise reducing property. Thus, the inflexible lightweight volume material can significantly reduce noise emitted by the thrust producing units, in particular by the associated rotor assemblies at respective wing tips, which are enclosed distant to the air duct where noise generation is normally very high, so that the foam-like volume<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> material will be extremely efficient due to its proximity to the tips of the rotor blades of the rotor assembly.</p>
<p id="p0130" num="0130">According to one aspect, an underlying thickness of all materials used for implementing the shrouding can advantageously be reduced for weight saving purposes. More specifically, the shrouding according to the present invention can be designed in a way that the inflexible lightweight volume material protects the main load carrying primary structure such that an overall system resp. the shrouding can be regarded as extremely damage tolerant, hence mitigating threats of tool drop, mishandling, hail impact or, in the worst case, blade impact. In all these cases, only the foam-like lightweight material of the stiffening secondary structure will be damaged, leaving the main load carrying primary structure intact and undamaged. In other words, the stiffening secondary structure has a protection function with respect to the main load carrying primary structure and, if an outer covering layer is provided, the latter allows to go closer to the real material that is usable in an underlying sizing process since no BVIDs, scratches, damage by hail strike, etc., which may occur during regular operation, need to be taken into account in the sizing process.</p>
<p id="p0131" num="0131">According to one aspect, repair costs of the shrouding can be reduced if the inflexible lightweight volume material of the stiffening secondary structure is used for protecting the main load carrying primary structure, as the inflexible lightweight volume material is generally much cheaper than a respective material that is used for implementing the main load carrying primary structure. Furthermore, in most cases the main load carrying primary structure must no longer be inspected as long as the stiffening secondary structure is intact or only comprises minor cosmetical damages.<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --></p>
<p id="p0132" num="0132">According to one aspect, the shrouding may have a cross-section that allows to implement an air inlet region and an air outlet region with differing diameters. For instance, in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 9</figref>, part (E), the shrouding has an oval cross-section with an oval that is inclined such that the air inlet region exhibits a greater diameter than the air outlet region. In contrast thereto, e. g. in <figref idref="f0005">Figure 9</figref>, part (A), the air inlet region and the air outlet region exhibit an at least essentially identical diameter.</p>
<p id="p0133" num="0133">According to one aspect, the main load carrying primary structure can be positioned at various different positions within the stiffening secondary structure of the shrouding, as illustrated above by way of example with respect to <figref idref="f0005">Figure 9</figref>. In other words, the main load carrying primary structure can be moved within a respective outer aerodynamic shape of the shrouding to a position where it does not intersect with a structural support respectively stator beam that supports the rotor assembly. This is important as the shrouding is usually part of a complete motor/rotor/duct lifting system and, thus, structural supports that support the motor and take over rotor assembly loads are connected to an aircraft airframe at almost the same position. This generally leads to difficulties in the integration of both main structural items as both carry significant loads and need to be connected to the aircraft airframe thoroughly.</p>
<p id="p0134" num="0134">Furthermore, a respective vertical position of the main load carrying primary structure within the stiffening secondary structure can be adapted to a location within the stiffening secondary structure which shows a best compromise between structuremechanical needs, aerodynamics, noise, integration, and so on. This is particularly relevant if one or more additional stator beams or struts are needed to fix the shrouding to a respective motor/rotor system in the middle of the shrouding.<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --></p>
<p id="p0135" num="0135">According to one aspect, the main load carrying primary structure consists of a main load carrying ring, which is preferably significantly stiffened and, thus, may comprise a reduced wall thickness. This is required as respective inflexible lightweight volume materials are attached to the main load carrying primary structure for load transfer and as the inflexible lightweight volume material has a high out-of-plane inertia compared to the thin-walled main load carrying ring.</p>
<p id="p0136" num="0136">According to one aspect, a cable routing path is arranged on an outer surface of the inventive shrouding so that installation efforts and, consequently costs, are significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p0137" num="0137">Finally, it should be noted that the inflexible lightweight volume material is preferably a non-structural foam-like material that is provided with a secondary structural function in view of the fact that the lightweight volume material is needed to eliminate secondary movements of the main load carrying primary structure. In other words, the inflexible lightweight volume material should not be flexible as solely forming/shaping item or transferring aerodynamic loads to a rigid sub-structure only.<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --></p>
