<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<heading id="h0001">[Technical Field]</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a food container.</p>
<heading id="h0002">[Background Art]</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, food containers such as beverage containers, yogurt containers, single-size containers and containers for cup ramen, and disposable containers for medical supplies require properties such as tensile strength, thermal resistance, a thermal barrier property, light resistance, moldability, surface glossiness, compressive strength, and printability.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, a synthetic resin (plastic) is advantageous in that it is light and strong, not rusted or rotted, easily transparent and colored and easily mass-produced, has excellent electrical insulation and excellent heat insulation, is clean, and excellent in food preservation, and thus is used for various purposes.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Particularly, containers manufactured of synthetic resins have been used for various purposes due to many advantages of low costs, light weights, easy molding and rigidity, and particularly, have been widely used as containers for food. As synthetic resins used for food containers, polystyrenes, polypropylenes, AS resins, and polycarbonates have been widely used.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">However, when such a synthetic resin container is used as a food container, an environmental hormone, which is a hazardous substance, is eluted from a surface<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of the synthetic resin container and comes in contact with foods, and thus may cause a problem of threatening the health of the human body. The environmental hormone is a substance that disturbs the endocrine system from which human hormones arise, and breaks the balance of the human body and hinders the development of the human body.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Hormones are substances that help the exchange of information between various cells and organs, and are dissolved in the blood and act on receptors of certain cells. If, rather than a hormone in the body, an environmental hormone having a similar chemical structure to the hormone, binds to the receptor, or an environmental hormone blocks an opening of the receptor, there may be an abnormality in the human body.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), such environmental hormones that have been proven to be hazardous until now are only a few, which include DDT used as an insecticide, DES used as a medication for preventing miscarriages, and dioxin generated during incineration of industrial wastes. However, other environmental hormones suspected to be hazardous mostly include an organic chlorine-based substance having a chemical structure similar to that of DDT. Other than these, vinclozolin, chlorothalonil, endosulfan, fenvalerate, styrene dimers, styrene trimers, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and some heavy metal compounds are also classified as environmental hormones.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">A styrene trimer, assumed as an environmental hormone, is generated from a cup ramen container, and bisphenol A is generated from a coating layer in a beverage can, a baby bottle, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Theoretically, these environmental hormones pose risks to all of the organs including the genitalia and affect the immune and nervous systems as well, and therefore they may lead to frequent sickness, and disorders such as anxiety, a lack of concentration, etc.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">To solve these problems, conventionally, a method of blocking the conduction of heat of contents in a cup or container by wrapping a paper (napkin) or thick corrugated paper cut to size, or double covering the cup or container with another disposable cup or the like has been used.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">When an external wrapping material is used by being rolled in a round shape, it has a heat insulating effect, but since the cup and an insulating sheet must be separately manufactured for use, due to separate manufacturing processes and a large amount of waste paper, high production and processing costs are needed.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Another method is to mold a container using a foam sheet manufactured by foaming a polystyrene resin. In this case, there is be a drawback in that, during the use of a thermal-resistant product, a styrene monomer is released and harmful to the human body.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Therefore, there is an urgent demand for development of a food container which satisfies basic physical properties of food containers, such as thermal resistance, moldability, strength, etc., does not generate a hazardous substance, has an improved thermal barrier property, thereby having an excellent heat insulation and safety in use.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">Examples of known food containers comprising foam sheet and resin layers are described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1160274A"><text>EP1160274</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5000991A"><text>US5000991</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006248030B"><text>JP2006248030</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6365249B"><text>US6365249</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1160274A"><text>EP1160274</text></patcit> describes a foam layer comprised of crystalline aromatic polyester resin prepuffs laminated with a film of an aromatic polyester resin.</p>

<heading id="h0004">[Technical Problem]</heading>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention is directed to providing a food container which satisfies the basic physical properties of a food container, for example, compressive strength, thermal resistance, printability and moldability, and has excellent safety in use due to a reduced elution amount of a hazardous substance.</p>

<p id="p0026" num="0026">Conventional food containers, for example, beverage containers, yogurt containers, single-size containers and containers for cup ramen, are generally manufactured of a polystyrene resin. When a synthetic resin container manufactured of such polystyrene resin is used as a food container, an environmental hormone, which is a hazardous substance, is eluted from a surface of the synthetic resin container and comes in contact with food, and it may cause a problem of threatening the health of the human body. A paper food container for preventing the elution of such a hazardous substance has problems of a significantly low thermal barrier property, significantly low compressive strength, and a 3 to 10-fold higher production cost than that of a synthetic resin container.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention is provided to solve the problems of the conventional food container, and provides a food container, which comprises an inner foam layer made of a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) resin such that it has a controlled cell size, improved compressive strength and a thermal barrier property and a relatively low glass transition temperature and an outer resin coating layer having a relatively high glass transition temperature, thereby significantly reducing an elution amount of a hazardous substance.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The food container according to the present invention has an inner foamed layer having an average cell size of 100 to 500 µm and an outer resin layer, wherein<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the resin layer is a coating layer of a resin having a repeating unit of Formula 1 below.
<chemistry id="chem0002" num="0002"><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="127" he="32" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In Formula 1, m and n represent mole fractions of repeating units, and range from 1 to 100, respectively.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">For example, m and n are mole fractions of repeating units, and a ratio of m and n may range from 1:9 to 7:2. Specifically, in a resin forming the resin layer, a content of the polymerization unit derived from cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) in a molecule may be 20 mol% or more, and specifically, the content of the polymerization unit derived from CHDM may range from 20 to 90 mol%, or 30 to 90 mol%. In Formula 1, when the content of the polymerization unit induced from CHDM satisfies the above-mentioned range, a melting point (Tm) may be reduced due to an induced decrease in crystallinity of the resin, resulting in the achievement of excellent processability.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Specifically, an average cell size of the foamed layer may be 110 to 450 µm, 130 to 430 µm,150 to 410 µm,180 to 400 µm, 200 to 380 µm, 220 to 360 µm or 250 to 350 µm. When the average cell size of the foamed layer is within the above-mentioned range, the thermal barrier property and compressive strength of the food container are improved, and it is easy to form a deeper inside of the food container in molding of the food container. When the cell size is larger than 500 µm, it is difficult to produce a deeper container by thermoforming in manufacture of the food<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> container, and compressive strength may be reduced, and when the cell size is smaller than the above-mentioned range, the compressive strength and the thermal barrier property may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In one example, a glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resin constituting the foamed layer may be 70 to 90 °C, 75 to 85 °C or 80 to 90 °C. In addition, a glass transition temperature of the resin constituting the resin layer may be 65 to 95 °C, 70 to 90 °C, 75 to 85 °C or 78 to 90 °C. Since the foamed layer according to the present invention satisfies the above-mentioned range of the glass transition temperature, a food container having excellent thermal resistance is provided.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In the present invention, the resin having the repeating unit of Formula 1 may be, for example, a polyethylene terephthalate glycol (hereinafter, referred to PETG) resin. Such a PETG resin may have a CHDM-copolymerized structure. The CHDM acts to prevent crystallization of the resin, and the CHDM-copolymerized PETG has a non-crystalline region. Therefore, the viscosity of the PETG resin is easily maintained, and thus a cohesive property between the foamed layer and the resin layer is imparted. Since the present invention has a structure in which a foamed layer of a resin having the glass transition temperature within the above-mentioned range and a PETG resin layer having a non-crystalline region are laminated, the present invention satisfies both moldability and thermal resistance of a food container.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In the present invention, the resin constituting the resin layer may not have a melting point (Tm) within the range of 40 to 270 °C. In the resin layer according to the present invention, a content of the polymerization unit derived from CHDM in a molecule constituting Formula 1 satisfies the above range, and thus includes a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> repeating unit that decreases the melting point of the resin as a main repeating unit. Therefore, since the resin layer according to the present invention does not have a melting point, it may have a low degree of crystallinity, and thus exhibit an excellent adhesive property. In addition, the non-crystallinity may result in excellent lightness.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In one example, in the present invention, a degree of crystallinity of the resin forming the resin layer may be less than 10%. Specifically, the degree of crystallinity may be 5% or less, 2% or less, 0 to 2%, 0.001 to 0.5%, or 0.001 to 0.1%, and more specifically, the degree of crystallinity may be 0%. Since the resin forming the resin layer according to the present invention satisfies the degree of crystallinity within the above-mentioned range, viscosity may be maintained within a suitable range even at a relatively low temperature in the manufacture of a food container, and thus excellent processability may be exhibited.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">The food container according to the present invention has a bilayer structure, in which an inner layer of the container is formed of the foamed layer, and an outer layer of the container is formed of the resin layer. That is, the inner layer of the container is the foamed layer of the resin having a glass transition temperature of 65 to 95 °C, and the outer layer of the container is the resin layer of the resin having a repeating unit of Formula 1 below.

<p id="p0037" num="0037">In Formula 1, m and n represent mole fractions of repeating units, and range from 1 to 100, respectively.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The food container according to the present invention may have a styrene elution amount of 50 mg/kg or less while being heated in an 800W microwave oven for 5 minutes. Specifically, when a prepared food container sample is heated in an 800W microwave oven for 5 minutes, an elution amount of a volatile substance is measured. For example, when the food container is heated in a microwave oven, the styrene elution amount may be 20 mg/kg or less, 10 mg/kg or less or 0.01 mg/kg or less, and more specifically, styrene may not be eluted. In the food container according to the present invention, a volatile substance such as toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropyl benzene or n-propyl benzene, in addition to the styrene, may not be eluted, and therefore, it can be seen that, when the food container according to the present invention is heated in a microwave oven, it is possible to effectively prevent the human body from being exposed to a hazardous substance.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The food container according to the present invention may have a difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the container of 10 °C or more, measured, under ambient conditions at room temperature, two minutes after 60 to 100 °C water is put into the container at 70% (v/v). This shows that the food container according to the present invention exhibits an excellent thermal barrier property, and specifically, the difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the container is measured 2 minutes after 100 °C water is put into the container at 70% (v/v). For example, the difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the food container under the above-described conditions may be 13 to 40 °C, 15 to 35 °C, 20 to 32 °C or 21.5 to 30 °C.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">As an example, two minutes after 60 to 100 °C water was put into the food container according to the present invention at 70% (v/v), when the outer temperature of the container is 40 °C, the inner temperature of the container may be 60 to 80 °C. As the difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the container according to the present invention is maintained relatively large under the above-mentioned conditions, it can be seen that the food container has an excellent thermal barrier property, and thus effectively improves heat insulation for food.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">In the present invention, the foamed layer is a foam sheet of a PET resin, and the resin layer is a coating layer of a PETG resin. The foamed layer may be provided in the form of a relatively thin foam sheet to achieve lightness, and the coating layer may be provided to achieve compressive strength.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">The foamed layer according to the present invention, that is, the foam sheet, may have a density of 30 to 400 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Specifically, the density of the foam sheet may be 50 to 350 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 70 to 300 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 80 to 250 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 90 to 200 kg/m<sup>3</sup> or 100 to 150 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. As the density of the foamed layer according to the present invention is in the above-mentioned range, the foamed layer may have a small thickness and improved compressive strength.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">Since the PETG resin does not generate a hazardous substance, there is a low risk in the manufacturing process and incineration, and therefore, when food is cooked using the food container according to the present invention, the elution amount of a hazardous substance is considerably reduced. In addition, when a coating layer is formed of the PETG resin, it imparts strength to the food container, thereby improving compressive strength, and has excellent printability and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> moldability. Therefore, a food container with a good appearance may be easily manufactured.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Specifically, the multilayer structure may have an average thickness of 1.2 to 4 mm, 1.5 to 3.5 mm, 1.8 to 3 mm, or 2 mm. In addition, a thickness ratio of the foamed layer to the resin layer may be, specifically, 10:0.2 to 1.5, 10:0.3 to 1, or 10:0.5. As the food container according to the present invention has the foamed layer and the resin layer, which have the above-mentioned thickness range, compressive strength may be improved, and lightness may also be satisfied.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">As an example, the food container may have an average thickness of 2 mm, the foamed layer may have an average thickness of 1.9 mm, and the resin layer may have an average thickness of 0.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">The food container according to the present invention may satisfy a condition represented by Mathematical Expression 1 below. <maths id="math0001" num="[Mathematical Expression 1]"><math display="block"><mfenced open="|" close="|" separators=""><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfenced><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>×</mo><mn>100</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>5</mn><mi>%</mi></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="51" he="13" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In Mathematical Expression 1, V<sub>0</sub> is a volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) of the food container before being exposed to 100 °C, and V<sub>1</sub> is a volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) of the food container after being exposed to 100 °C for 20 minutes.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Specifically, a dimensional variation before and after the manufactured food container sample is exposed to 100 °C for 20 minutes is measured. This is a measured value corresponding to a long-term dimensional variation of the food container according to the present invention. For example, the volume may refer to a value calculated by multiplying a length, a width and a thickness of a thermal-resistant material. For example, the dimensional variation according to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Mathematical Expression 1 may be 3% or less, 1% or less, 0.1% or less, 0.001% or less, or 0.0001 to 0.001%, and specifically, there may be no change in dimension. As the above-mentioned range of the value of Mathematical Expression 1 is satisfied, it can be seen that there is almost no change in shape of the food container according to the present invention even when used in a high temperature environment. Therefore, it can be seen that the food container according to the present invention has excellent thermal resistance.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">When the value of Mathematical Expression 1 is more than 5%, it can mean that swell, distortion, discoloration or deformation may easily occur in the food container.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The food container according to the present invention may have compressive strength of 40 kgf or more, which is measured when a load is applied vertically to one surface or a lower surface of the food container at a speed of 100 mm/min.</p>

The food container according to the present invention may have the above-mentioned range of compressive strength by forming a PET foam sheet as the inner layer of the container, and forming a coating layer consisting of a PETG resin as an outer layer of the container. Such a food container has an advantage in that it is not easily deformed by an external physical force.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">The food container according to the present invention may have a moisture permeability of 16 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day or less, which is measured according to ASTM D 1249.

For example, the moisture permeability measured under the above conditions may be 15 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day or less, 13 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day or less, 1 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day, 2 to 9 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day or 3 to 8.8 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day.</p>

For example, the oxygen permeability measured under the above conditions may satisfy 50 to 1,450 cc/m<sup>2</sup>·day, 100 to 1,400 cc/m<sup>2</sup>·day, or 150 to 1,350 cc/m<sup>2</sup>·day. The food container according to the present invention is manufactured by forming a PET foam sheet as the inner layer of the container and forming a coating layer consisting of a PETG resin as the outer layer of the container, thereby satisfying the moisture permeability and oxygen permeability as described above, and the food container according to the present invention may satisfy the above-mentioned ranges of low moisture permeability and low oxygen permeability, thereby exhibiting excellent oxygen and moisture barrier performance, resulting in the extension of the preservation period of food.</p>

As a PET foam sheet is formed as the inner layer of the container, and a coating layer consisting of a PETG resin is formed as the outer layer of the container, the food container according to the present invention may exhibit tensile strengths within the above-mentioned ranges, and thus it may not be easily deformed by a physical force.</p>

<p id="p0057" num="0057">To manufacture a food container according to the present invention, first, 100 parts by weight of a PET resin was dried at 130 °C to remove moisture, mixed with 1 part by weight of pyromellitic dianhydride, 1 part by weight of talc and 0.1 part by weight of Irganox (IRG 1010) with respect to 100 parts by weight of the moisture-removed<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> PET resin in a first extruder and heated to 280 °C, thereby preparing a resin melt. Subsequently, 5 parts by weight of butane gas as a foaming agent was added to the first extruder, with respect to 100 parts by weight of the PET resin, and extrusion foaming was performed, thereby obtaining a PET foam sheet. The obtained foam sheet has a density of approximately 120 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and a thickness of approximately 1.9 mm. Afterward, one surface of the foam sheet was extrusion-coated with PETG, thereby forming a coating layer with a thickness of 100 µm. And then, the foam sheet having the coating layer was subjected to thermoforming at 140 °C, thereby manufacturing a food container. The manufactured food container had an average thickness of 2 mm. <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an SEM image showing a cell size of the foam sheet formed according to the example.
