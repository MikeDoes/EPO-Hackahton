<description id="desc" lang="en"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> -->
<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">Diabetes mellitus is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced in the body, however patients have a resistance to the effects of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the insulin-sensitive muscle, liver and adipose tissues. Type 2 diabetes patients often have normal levels of insulin, and may have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels), as they compensate for the reduced effectiveness of insulin by secreting increased amounts of insulin. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle, and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Patients who have insulin resistance often have Metabolic Syndrome (as defined in the <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670</text></nplcit>). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that occur with Type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">There are several available treatments for Type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories are the recommended first-line treatment of Type 2 diabetes and of prediabetic<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conditions associated with insulin resistance, however compliance is generally poor. Pharmacologic treatments for diabetes have largely focused on three areas of pathophysiology: (1) hepatic glucose production (biguanides, such as phenformin and metformin), (2) insulin resistance (PPAR agonists, such as rosiglitazone, troglitazone, engliazone, balaglitazone,and pioglitazone), (3) insulin secretion (sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide, glipizide and glimipiride); (4) incretin hormone mimetics (GLP-1 derivatives and analogs, such as exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide and taspoglutide); and (5) inhibitors of incretin hormone degradation (DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, alogliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, denagliptin and saxagliptin).</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The two best known biguanides, phenformin and metformin, cause some correction of hyperglycemia, but can also induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. PPAR gamma agonists, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are modestly effective in reducing plasma glucose and Hemoglobin A1C. However, the currently marketed glitazones do not greatly improve lipid metabolism and may negatively effect on the lipid profile. The administration of insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide, glipizide, and glimepiride) can result in hypoglycemia; their administration must therefore be carefully controlled.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">There has been a renewed focus on pancreatic islet-based insulin secretion that is controlled by glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This approach has the potential for stabilization and restoration of β-cell function. Several orphan G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR's) have been identified that are preferentially expressed in the β-cell and that are implicated in glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). GPR40 is a cell-surface GPCR that is highly expressed in human (and rodent) islets as well as in insulin-secreting cell lines. Several naturally-occurring medium to longchain fatty acids (FA's) as well as synthetic compounds, including several members of the thiazolidinedione class of PPARy agonists, have recently been identified as ligands for GPR40 [<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Itoh, Y. et al., Nature, 422: 173 (2003</text></nplcit>); <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Briscoe, C.P. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 278: 11303 (2003</text></nplcit>); <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Kotarsky, K. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 301: 406 (2003</text></nplcit>)]. Under hyperglycemic conditions, GPR40 agonists are capable of augmenting the release of insulin from islet cells. The specificity of this response is suggested by results showing that the inhibition of GPR40 activity by siRNA attenuates FA-induced amplification of GSIS. These findings indicate that, in addition to the intracellular generation of lipid-derivatives of FA's that are thought to promote insulin release, FA's (and other synthetic GPR40 agonists) may also act as extracellular ligands that bind to GPR40 in mediating FA-induced insulin secretion. There are several potential advantages of GPR40 as a target for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. First, since GPR40-mediated insulin secretion is glucose dependent, there is little or no risk of hypoglycemia. Second, the limited tissue distribution of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> GPR40 (mainly in islets) suggests that there would be less chance for side effects associated with GPR40 activity in other tissues. Third, GPR40 agonists that are active in the islets may have the potential to restore or preserve islet function. This would be advantageous, because long term diabetes therapy often leads to the gradual diminution of islet activity; after extended periods of treatment, it is often necessary to treat Type 2 diabetic patients with daily insulin injections. By restoring or preserving islet function, GPR40 agonists may delay or prevent the diminution and loss of islet function in a Type 2 diabetic patient.</p>

<p id="p0066" num="0066">The term "substituted" shall be deemed to include multiple degrees of substitution by a named substitutent. Where multiple substituent moieties are disclosed or claimed, the substituted compound can be independently substituted by one or more of the disclosed or claimed substituent moieties, singly or plurally. By independently substituted, it is meant that the (two or more) substituents can be the same or different.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, salts and/or dosage forms which are, using sound medical judgment, and following all applicable government regulations, safe and suitable for administration to a human being or an animal.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">The term "% enantiomeric excess" (abbreviated "ee") shall mean the % major enantiomer less the % minor enantiomer. Thus, a 70% enantiomeric excess corresponds to formation of 85% of one enantiomer and 15% of the other. The term "enantiomeric excess" is synonymous with the term "optical purity."</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">Compounds of Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers.

The individual tautomers as well as mixture thereof are encompassed with compounds of Formula I.</p>
<p id="p0072" num="0072">In the compounds of general formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of structural formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (<sup>1</sup>H), deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H), and tritium (<sup>3</sup>H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Tritium is radioactive and may therefore provide for a radiolabeled compound, useful as a tracer in metabolic or kinetic studies. Isotopically-enriched compounds within structural formula I, can be prepared without<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">The independent syntheses of optical isomers and diastereoisomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein.

<p id="p0074" num="0074">If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well-known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p0075" num="0075">Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p0076" num="0076">Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention.

Such solvates are encompassed within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p0077" num="0077">It is generally preferable to administer compounds of the present invention as enantiomerically pure formulations. Racemic mixtures can be separated into their individual enantiomers by any of a number of conventional methods.

<p id="p0091" num="0091">The term "diabetes," as used herein, includes both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM, also known as type 1 diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., NIDDM, also known as Type 2 diabetes). Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. Type 2 diabetes, or insulin-independent diabetes (i.e., non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most of the Type 2 diabetics are also obese. The compositions of the present invention may be useful for treating both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The term "diabetes associated with obesity" refers to diabetes caused by obesity or resulting from obesity. Diabetes is characterized by a fasting plasma glucose level of greater than or equal to 126<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> mg/dl. A diabetic subject has a fasting plasma glucose level of greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl. A pre diabetic subject is someone suffering from prediabetes. Prediabetes is characterized by an impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of greater than or equal to 110 mg/dl and less than 126 mg/dl; or impaired glucose tolerance; or insulin resistance. A prediabetic subject is a subject with impaired fasting glucose (a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of greater than or equal to 110 mg/dl and less than 126 mg/dl); or impaired glucose tolerance (a 2 hour plasma glucose level of ≥140 mg/dl and &lt;200 mg/dl); or insulin resistance, resulting in an increased risk of developing diabetes.</p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">Treatment of diabetes mellitus refers to the administration of a compound or combination of the present invention to treat a diabetic subject. One outcome of treatment may be decreasing the glucose level in a subject with elevated glucose levels.

<p id="p0137" num="0137">Scheme A describes a general method for the synthesis of chromans such as compound A5. Enol ether A1 undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with a ortho-quinone methide, which was formed from a compound such as compound A2 via ether thermal conditions or Lewis Acid mediated conditions, such as treatment with BF<sub>3</sub>·Et<sub>2</sub>O and the like, in a solvent, such as CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and the like, to afford the cycloadduct A3. Compound A4 is prepared via treatment of A3 with a Lewis acid such as BF<sub>3</sub>·Et<sub>2</sub>O, followed by triethylsilane or a protic acid such as TFA, and followed by triethylsilane. Alternatively, a 2-step sequence can be performed wherein A3 is treated with a protic acid such as TsOH in refluxing toluene, followed by hydrogenation of the resulting chromene to afford A4. The ester present in A4 then undergoes hydrolysis with an aqueous base, such as lithium hydroxide and the like, in a solvent mixture, such as THF:MeOH and the like, to afford the desired final compounds A5.<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> -->

<p id="p0138" num="0138">Scheme B describes a general method for the synthesis of isochromans such as compound B9. Lithiation of 4-bromo-N,N-diethyl-2-methylbenzamide, followed by addition of a Weinreb amide such as B1 affords ketones B2. Racemic reduction of B2 with sodium borohydride affords compounds B3. Alternatively asymmetric reduction of B2 via established Noyori-type conditions can be accomplished. Acid-mediated cyclization of B3 results in the lactone B4. Reduction of the lactone B4 can be accomplished with BH<sub>3</sub>·Me<sub>2</sub>S to provide isochroman B5. Palladium-mediated conversion of B5 to the pinacol boronate, followed by palladium-mediated cross-coupling with tosylates B6 provides the cinnamates B7. As an alternative to B6, the vinyl triflate can be used. Reduction of the alkene present in B7 with methods such as hydrogen and rhodium on alumina or hydrogen and palladium on carbon affords compounds B8. Alternatively, B7 can undergo ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Hydrolysis of B8 via a method similar to that described in Scheme A affords final compounds B9.<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --></p>

<p id="p0351" num="0351">Male C57BL/6N mice (7-12 weeks of age) are housed 10 per cage and given access to normal diet rodent chow and water <i>ad libitum.</i> Mice are randomly assigned to treatment groups and fasted 4 to 6 h. Baseline blood glucose concentrations are determined by glucometer from tail nick blood. Animals are then treated orally with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) or test compound. Blood glucose concentration is measured at a set time point after treatment (t = 0 min) and mice are then intraperitoneally-challenged with dextrose (2 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice is challenged with saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels are determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40, 60 min after dextrose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from t = 0 to t = 60 min is used to integrate an area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment are generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls.<!-- EPO <DP n="105"> --></p>
