<heading id="h0002"><b>GOVERNMENT GRANT SUPPORT CLAUSE</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">This invention was made with U.S. Federal support under Grant Award No T32A 1055456 awarded by the National Institute for Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Described herein are pharmaceutical compositions and medical uses for modulating the immune system, such as for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases and foreign graft rejection</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Autoimmune diseases and graft rejection are well recognized problems Current clinical practice is to administer immunosuppressants that prevent T-cell activity. Such immunosuppressants are administered for an extended period in autoimmune disease, and often for the lifetime of the patient who has received foreign grafts The requirement for long term use of immunosuppressants makes successful treatment dependent on frequent medical monitoring, and exposes the patient to serious side effects from the drugs. As an alternative, it would be advantageous to develop a treatment that "teaches" the immune system to control/eliminate destructive immune responses generated by specific antigens</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The present inventor has previously demonstrated immunomodulation by display of SA-FasL on the surface of biological membranes modified with biotin. Injecting subjects with foreign cells decorated with SA-FasL has shown efficacy in modulating immune responses and achieving long term survival of tolerance to grafted tissues Nevertheless, there remains a need for methods that "teach" the immune system to tolerate specific foreign and self antigens, that exhibit improved efficacy and are useful in a broad variety of applications.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention described herein relates to the surprising discovery that soluble SA-FasL, together with IL-2, optionally together with FasL-decorated cells and/or IL-2-decorated cells, is useful for inducing long-term and specific immunosuppression. Thus, described herein are compositions, medicaments and medical uses for immunomodulation, such as for long-term prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune diseases and long-term prevention and/or treatment of graft rejection The invention provides a medicament for use in inducing immune tolerance in a subject in need thereof, comprising (i) a chimeric FasL protein comprising a FasL moiety and a streptavidin or avidin moiety and (ii) an IL-2 protein, wherein the chimeric FasL protein and IL-2 protein are provided in separate compositions or in the same composition</p>

<heading id="h0007"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention relates to the discovery that soluble SA-FasL, together with IL-2, optionally together with FasL-decorated cells and/or IL-2-decorated cells, can be used to achieve long-term, specific immunosuppression</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector cells, in particular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, play a critical role in the initiation and perpetuation of various autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and in foreign graft rejection, including rejection of allogeneic and xenogeneic grafts. T effector cells, therefore, represent an important target for immune modulation to prevent and treat these diseases Under normal physiological conditions, T effector cells are kept in check by another class of T cells, designated as T regulatory cells. Mounting scientific evidence demonstrates that the disturbance of the physiological balance between T effector and T regulatory cells in favor of T effector cells is an underlying cause of many autoimmune diseases and foreign graft rejection Approaches that target both T effector cells and T regulatory cells have significant therapeutic potential for reestablishing the physiological balance in autoimmunity, and for tilting the balance in favor of T regulatory cells in case of graft rejection</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Following antigen recognition and activation, T effector cells upregulate the Fas receptor on their surface and become sensitive to FasL-mediated apoptosis Importantly FasL-mediated apoptosis is critical to the induction of self-tolerance and maintenance as deficiency in Fas or<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> FasL is associated with massive autoimmunity both in humans and in rodents. This suggests that there are no compensatory mechanisms for this pathway, further emphasizing its importance as a target for immunomodulation.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Particular details of various embodiments of the invention are set forth below to illustrate certain aspects, but not to limit the scope of, the invention. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention described herein. In the discussion that follows, specific embodiments of different aspects of the invention are described. It should be understood that any specific embodiment of one aspect may be used in conjunction with any specific embodiment of another aspect, even if every possible permutation and combination of specific embodiments is not expressly set forth.</p>

</ul></p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">Other terms are defined elsewhere herein. It is to be understood that each embodiment can be operated with every other embodiment</p>
<heading id="h0009"><b><u>Proteins and Chimeric Proteins</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Described herein are strategies for the induction of immune tolerance, some of which include the use of chimeric proteins which can be made by constructing chimeric cDNAs. A chimeric protein may comprise at least a functional portion of a member of a binding pair, such as streptavidin or avidin, operably linked to at least a functional portion of an apoptosis-inducing molecule, such as FasL, TNFa, TRAIL (Apo2 ligand), and TWEAK (Apo3 ligand) or the like. As used herein, the term "functional portion" of an apoptosis-inducing molecule means an apoptosis-inducing portion As used herein, "FasL moiety" means at least the apoptosis-inducing moiety of FasL A chimeric protein may comprise the extracellular domain of FasL as the apoptosis-inducing molecule, i.e. the FasL moiety. Independently, the chimeric protein may comprise streptavidin (or core streptavidin) as the binding pair member. The present invention uses a chimeric protein comprising a streptavidin (or core streptavidin) or avidin moiety and a FasL moiety. In one embodiment, the chimeric FasL protein has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. The present invention also uses IL-2 As used herein, "IL-2" includes chimeric IL-2, non chimeric IL-2 (such as may be obtained commercially) and proteins that contain the IL-2 moiety.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> "IL-2 moiety," as used herein contains at least the part of IL-2 sufficient for binding to the IL-2 receptor and causing signaling. In some embodiments, a chimeric IL-2 protein comprises at least a functional portion of a member of a binding pair, such as streptavidin or avidin, operably linked to at least a functional portion of IL-2, i.e IL-2 moiety. In specific embodiments, a chimeric" IL-2 protein comprises a streptavidin (or core streptavidin) moiety and an IL-2 moiety. In one embodiment the chimeric IL-2 protein has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. It is to be understood that these constructs are representative, and not limiting of chimeric proteins that can be used accordance with the present disclosure. As an example, a cell for the production of chimeric proteins as described herein may be the <i>Drosophila</i> system that is commercially available. Those skilled in the art of producing chimeric proteins will recognize that other expression systems and vectors are suitable for production of the chimeric proteins described herein, such as <i>Escherichia coli,</i> yeast and mammalian cell cultures.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">"Binding pair" refers to two molecules which interact with each other through any of a variety of molecular forces including, for example, ionic, covalent, hydrophobic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding, so that the pair have the property of binding specifically to each other Specific binding means that the binding pair members exhibit binding to each other under conditions where they do not bind to another molecule. Examples of binding pairs are biotin-streptavidin, biotin-avidin, hormone-receptor, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate, IgG-protein A, antigen-antibody, and the like</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">An exemplary binding pair is biotin and streptavidin (SA) or avidin. As used herein "biotin" includes biotin-containing moieties that are able to bind to surfaces, such as cell surfaces (including tumor cell surfaces), such as NHS-biotin and EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) Such protein reactive forms of biotin are available commercially.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The interaction between biotin and its binding partner, avidin or streptavidin, offers several advantages in the present context. For example, biotin has an extremely high affinity for both streptavidin (10<sup>13</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) and avidin (10<sup>15</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) This embodiment also is advantageous because conjugates comprising streptavidin or avidin can be further complexed with conjugates comprising biotin Additionally, both streptavidin and avidin are tetrameric polypeptides that each bind four molecules of biotin. Conjugates comprising streptavidin or avidin therefore have a tendency to form tetramers and higher structures, and can form complexes with multiple biotin-containing moieties.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">SA or avidin fragments which retain substantial binding activity for biotin, such as at least 50% or more of the binding affinity of native SA or avidin, respectively, also may be used. Such fragments include "core streptavidin" ("CSA"), a truncated version of the full-length streptavidin polypeptide which may include streptavidin residues 13-138, 14-138, 13-139 or 14-139. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Pahler et al., 1987, J. Biol. Chem., 262: 13933-37</text></nplcit>. Other truncated forms of streptavidin and avidin that retain strong binding to biotin also may be used. <i>See, e.g.</i> <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Sano et al., 1995, J Biol Chem. 270(47): 28204-09</text></nplcit> (describing core streptavidin variants 16-133 and 14-138) (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6022951A"><text>U.S. patent no. 6,022,951</text></patcit>). Mutants of streptavidin and core forms of strepavidin which retain substantial biotin binding activity or increased biotin binding activity also may be used. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Chilcoti et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 92(5): 1754-58</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Reznik et al., 1996, Nat Biotechnol. 14(8): 1007-11</text></nplcit>. For example, mutants with reduced immunogenicity, such as mutants mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to remove potential T cell epitopes or lymphocyte epitopes, can be used. <i>See</i> <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Meyer et al., 2001, Protein Sci. 10: 491-503</text></nplcit>. Likewise, mutants of avidin and core forms of avidin which retain substantial biotin binding activity or increased biotin binding activity also may be used. <i>See</i> <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Hiller et al., 1991, J. Biochem. 278: 573-85</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Livnah et al., 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 5076-80 (1993</text></nplcit>). For convenience, in the instant description, the terms "avidin" and "streptavidin" as used herein are intended to encompass biotin-binding fragments, mutants and core forms of these binding pair members. Avidin and streptavidin are available from commercial suppliers. Moreover, the nucleic acid sequences encoding streptavidin and avidin and the streptavidin and avidin amino acid sequences can be found, for example, in GenBank Accession Nos. X65082; X03591; NM_205320; X05343; Z21611; and Z21554.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Other mechanisms (e.g., other conjugation methods using, for example, other linking moieties or chemical or genetic cross-linking) can be used to provide linkages to bind a protein (e.g. FasL or IL-2) to a surface. Other mechanisms can be used to provide higher-order structures of immune co-stimulatory molecules, such as conjugates comprising dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher-order multimers of immune co-stimulatory molecules, which also will exhibit advantageous properties. Such conjugates are included within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">As used herein, the existing of a binding moiety permits the chimeric protein to bind to e.g. a cell surface. As used herein, a cell to which is bound FasL, IL-2 and the like may be said<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> to be "decorated" with FasL, IL-2, etc. Likewise, the FasL on a cell would be a "membrane bound FasL," "bound FasL", or "mFasL"; and the IL-2 on a cell would be "membrane bound IL-2", "bound IL-2" or "mIL-2"</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">A chimeric protein may also be unbound to a surface. Such a chimeric protein may be said to be "soluble." As used herein "soluble FasL" or "sFasL" means a molecule containing the FasL moiety that is not bound to a surface (such as a cell). The FasL may be a chimeric FasL. It should be noted that "soluble FasL" as used herein contains the apoptotic extracellular moiety of FasL, and is distinct from an unbound molecule derived from FasL that is unable to induce apoptosis.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">A "soluble IL-2" or "sIL-2" as used herein means that the IL-2 is not bound not bound to a surface (such as a cell). The soluble IL-2 may be a chimeric IL-2, or may be non-chimeric IL-2.</p>
<heading id="h0010"><b><u>Cells</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Certain embodiments described herein use or comprise a cell, tissue or organ. In particular embodiments, the cell is a mammalian cell. In embodiments related to graft rejection, the cell may be of the same type as the cell of the graft to be transplanted. Additionally or alternatively, the cell may be of a different type from the graft but from the same donor, to induce tolerance to the donor graft. For example, FasL-decorated donor cells can be used to induce immune tolerance in the subject who has received, is receiving, or will receive a graft from the same donor. The administration of donor tissue, organs or cells is then more likely to be tolerated by the subject.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">To illustrate, a subject may be administered pancreatic islet cells to treat diabetes. To prevent rejection, the subject may be administered pancreatic islet cells that are decorated with FasL. Additionally or alternatively, the subject may be administered a different type of FasL-decorated donor cells, such as splenocytes, PBMCs, bone marrow cells, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, dendritic cells, cardiac myocytes, and vascular cells, etc., to induce immune tolerance to the donor's cells.

<p id="p0085" num="0085">Immunomodulation with SA-FasL-engineered islets requires a short course of rapamycin treatment for tolerogenic efficacy (<figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). This may be due to the limited amount of SA-FasL protein displayed on islets or short duration because of high turnover kinetics, thereby minimizing its tolerogenic effect. We, therefore, asked if SA-FasL can be used as a soluble protein to obviate the need for rapamycin. The use of SA-FasL as a soluble protein over the form attached to biological membranes for immunomodulation has various advantageous. First, the clinical and regulatory paths for using immunomodulatory biologics are well established. Second, the use of soluble biologics for therapy is practical as it involves simple injections. Third, the dose and treatment frequency and duration of soluble biologics can easily be established for the desired therapeutic outcome. Importantly, SA-FasL in soluble form may have wider applications as compared with the form fixed on biological surfaces.</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">Intraperitoneal treatment of graft recipients with 2-5 µg SA-FasL protein/mouse on days 1, 3, 5, 7 post-transplantation resulted in robust tolerogenic efficacy to allogeneic SA-FasL-islet grafts as only 1/8 had delayed rejection (∼70 days; <figref idref="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref>). Treatment with soluble SA-FasL only under a short course of rapamycin was also effective, achieving &gt; 80% graft survival.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">To further establish SA-FasL as a soluble biologic, we tested its immunomodulatory capacity for the prevention of allogeneic islets transplanted using a more stringent model of intraportal islet transplantation. The rationale for this model is twofold. First, intraportal islet transplantation is the only site practiced in the clinic. Second, intraportal islet transplantation provides a much more stringent model as compared to subrenal islet transplantation. As shown in <figref idref="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref><b>,</b> only 30% of recipients receiving allogeneic islets engineered with SA-FasL have long-term survival when transplanted intraportally in the BALB/c-to-C57BL/6 model. This is to be contrasted to 100% survival when SA-FasL-engineered islets transplanted under the kidney capsule. Therefore, we used this model to test if SA-FasL can be developed as a soluble biologic for the prevention and treatment of type I diabetes and foreign graft rejection. All BALB/c islets engineered with SA-FasL protein survived when 4 doses of SA-FasL (2-5 µg/injection) were administered into C57BL/6 recipients intravenously or intraperitoneally on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post-transplantation. Indeed, the need for islet engineering with SA-FasL can also be overcome by systemic and protracted use of soluble FasL (1 µg injection daily for 20 days starting on day of transplantation). Only one out of six mice rejected the graft on day 80 post-transplantation.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">These observations are important from two perspectives; i) for demonstrating that SA-FasL as monotherapy is sufficient to induce tolerance, but that the window of immunomodulation needs to be extended, and ii) SA-FasL can be used as a soluble biologic for immunomodulation at therapeutic doses without toxicity.</p>
<heading id="h0017"><b><u>EXAMPLE 3 SA-FasL as an effective immunomodulator to control T memory responses.</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Inasmuch as individuals with onset of autoimmunity have a large pool of activated and memory T cells, we asked if SA-FasL is capable of inducing apoptosis in such cells. For this purpose, we used nonhuman primate (NHP) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMCs). The PBMCs from 3 different NHPs were incubated with SA-FasL protein and apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. Almost all T cells expressing Fas underwent apoptosis irrespective of their phenotype, Teff (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>-</sup>Fas<sup>+</sup>) or T central (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup>Fas<sup>+</sup>) memory (<figref idref="f0003"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">To further provide in vivo data for efficacy of SA-FasL to overcome rejection in recipients with a large T cell memory pool, a set of C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with BALB/c skin grafts. These mice rejected skin grafts within 20 days. Mice were then made diabetic using STZ and transplanted with BALB/c SA-FasL-islet grafts 40-50 days post skin transplantation under transient cover of rapamycin. All mice remained euglycemic for an observation period over 140 days (<figref idref="f0004"><b>FIG. 4A</b></figref>). Surgical removal of the kidney harboring islets resulted in prompt hyperglycemia, demonstrating that euglycemia was due to islet grafts (<figref idref="f0004"><b>FIG. 4B</b></figref>). Taken together, these observations are important as various tolerance protocols fail to eliminate/control T memory cells, which serve as a major barrier for achieving clinical tolerance.</p>
<heading id="h0018"><b><u>EXAMPLE 4 SA-FasL as an immunomodulator to prevent Type 1 Diabetes.</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">Inasmuch as antigen-experienced cells express Fas receptor on their surface, systemic treatment with SA-FasL has potential to eliminate such cells and control/reverse T1D without a major effect on quiescent T cell repertoire. This notion was tested by treating 10-wk female NOD mice daily with 500 ng SA-FasL protein for 30 days. As shown in <figref idref="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref><b>,</b> this treatment significantly delayed the onset and incidence of T1D as compared with controls. We did not observe any sign of SA-FasL toxicity. We next asked the question if SA-FasL will work in synergy with IL-2. Without being bound by theory, we hypothesized that IL-2 can further enhance FasL mediated apoptosis of T cells by various means, including down-regulating anti-apoptotic genes, such as cFLIP. In marked contrast, IL-2 is also critical growth and survival<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> factor for T regulatory cells and T regulatory cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis due to the expression of high levels of anti-apoptotic genes, such as cFLIP. Indeed, T regulatory cells express FasL on their surface and control T effector responses by direct elimination via Fas receptor or indirectly by eliminating Fas-expressing DCs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combinatorial use of SA-FasL and IL-2 may be effective in immune modulating auto and alloreactive responses for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">Treatment of female NOD (10-wk old) with a combination of SA-FasL and 3000 IU IL-2 daily for 30 days resulted in much improved delay of onset and incidence of diabetes. Indeed, the SA-FasL+IL-2 regimen performed as well as SA-FasL+rapamycin with respect to prevention of diabetes. These data demonstrate that SA-FasL is effective in delaying the onset and preventing the incidence of type 1 diabetes in NOD and works in synergy with IL-2 or rapamycin for a better outcome.</p>
<heading id="h0019"><b><u>EXAMPLE 5 SA-FasL synergized with IL-2 to promote long-term survival of transplanted pancreatic islets.</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">The combined use of soluble forms of SA-FasL and IL-2 in modulating immune response to autoantigens and preventing diabetes in NOD led us to test the combined use of these molecules as soluble biologics and a combination of soluble biologics and displayed on the surface of pancreatic islets. C57BL/6 mice were treated with intravenous injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) and diabetes was confirmed by two consecutive blood glucose readings higher than 300 mg/dl. Pancreatic islets were harvested from BALB/c mice, cultured overnight, and then either left unmodified or engineered with SA-FasL alone or in combination with SA-IL2. These islets were then immediately transplanted intraportally into diabetic mice (450-550 islets/mouse). Mice were then treated with the indicated proteins and doses. Animals were monitored for diabetes, and those with two consecutive daily measurements of ≥ 250 mg/dl blood glucose level were considered diabetic and confirmation of graft failure. The data demonstrate that soluble SA-FasL as monotherapy prevents the rejection of ∼60% of allogeneic islets and soluble IL-2 work in synergy and prevents the rejection in 100% of recipients long-term (<figref idref="f0006"><b>FIG. 6A</b></figref>). Soluble IL-2 also works in synergy with SA-FasL on the surface of islet to prevent graft rejection in all graft recipients. Importantly, co-display of both SA-FasL and SA-IL2 was also effective in preventing rejection of ∼40% of grafts (<figref idref="f0006"><b>FIG. 6B</b></figref>).<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p>
<heading id="h0020"><b><u>EXAMPLE 6 SA-FasL protein as a biologic for the prevention of cardiac allograft rejection.</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0094" num="0094">We next tested if SA-FasL as a biologic can work as an immunomodulator to prevent rejection of vascularized solid grafts. Heart transplantation from BALB/c into C57BL/6 mice was used as a stringent allogeneic heart graft model. C57BL/6 recipients of allogeneic BALB/c hearts were treated with a short course of IL-2 (7 doses) and SA-FasL (15 doses) without any other manipulation. As shown in <figref idref="f0007"><b>FIG. 7</b></figref><b>,</b> SA-FasL as monotherapy caused moderate prolongation of the grafts, while IL-2 did not have a significant effect. However, the combination of both molecules had robust tolerance effects with only 1 out of 9 grafts showing delayed rejection, whereas the rest survived for a 100-day observation period (data is from &gt;3 independent experiments and hearts were scored in blind fashion by 2 individuals). We also demonstrated that soluble use of SA-FasL in combination with rapamycin was also effective in preventing cardiac graft rejection (<b>Table 1</b>).

<p id="p0096" num="0096">The data shows that SA-FasL and IL-2 is surprisingly effective at inducing long term tolerance. The use of IL-2 by itself has no effect on inducing tolerance, but IL-2 synergistically<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> enhances the effect of FasL in inducing long term tolerance to selected antigens. Therefore, the combined use of SA-FasL and IL-2 constitutes a major improvement in treating autoimmune disease and in inducing transplantation tolerance.</p>
<heading id="h0021"><b><u>EXAMPLE 7 SA-FasL protein work in synergy with IL-2 to prevent bone marrow graft rejection and establish mixed hematopoietic chimerism.</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a source of hematopoietic stem cells is perceived as a powerful therapeutic regimen that can potentially treat a variety of inherited and acquired diseases, such as enzyme deficiencies, metabolic disorders, cancer. BMT leading to mixed allogeneic hematopoietic chimerism (MAHC) can be used as an immunomodulatory approach to induce tolerance to auto-, allo-, and xenoantigens for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and prevention of foreign graft rejection. Mixed chimeras are tolerant to both donor and host antigens since i) stem cells in the donor bone marrow give rise to immune cells, such as lymphocytes, that are "educated" in the host immune environment for nonresponsiveness to the host antigens and ii) macrophages and dendritic cells arising from the donor bone marrow serve as antigen-presenting cells in the thymus to eliminate donor reactive host lymphocytes. In addition to this "central tolerance", other peripheral immunoregulatory mechanisms, such as clonal anergy and immune suppression, appear to contribute to the overall tolerance observed in mixed hematopoietic chimeras.</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">Establishment of MAHC using BMT suffers from three major obstacles; graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, host-versus-graft (HVG) reaction, and stem cell competition. GVH reactions are primarily mediated by mature donor T cells in the transplanted bone marrow inoculum that recognize host alloantigens and mount an immune response, resulting in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD affects many organs and often yields life threatening complications. Although depletion of mature T cells from BM grafts is effective in preventing GVHD, it is associated with a high incidence of engraftment failure. Current treatment for GVHD involves nonspecific immunosuppression using various agents. However, although somewhat effective in preventing GVHD, the chronic use of these agents is associated with increase incidences of secondary malignancies and infections.</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">Rejection of allogeneic BMC by the host mature T cells represents a second hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to establish mixed chimerism. A series of approaches have been implemented to physically and functionally eliminate host T cells reactive to donor BMC for the<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> establishment of mixed chimerism. These regimens mostly rely on nonspecific immunosuppressive regimens or generalized lymphocyte-specific interventions. All of these approaches can potentially render the host immunoincompetent. Therefore, it is important to develop clinically applicable protocols that are more effective, specific for the elimination of pathogenic T cells, and involves minimal conditioning of the host.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">The third important barrier for the establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism is the competition between the donor and host HSC for available niches. In order to facilitate engraftment, most mixed chimerism protocols developed to date rely on host preconditioning to achieve some level of host HSC depletion. Total body irradiation has been the method of choice because of its reproducibility and ease of administration.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101">The efficacy of combined use of soluble SA-FasL and IL-2 in inducing tolerance to allogeneic pancreatic islets as tissue graft led us to test if this regimen is also effective in inducing tolerance to a solid organ. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 300 cGy total body irradiation followed by intravenous transplantation of 30x10<sup>6</sup> unmodified (BMC) or SA-FasL (mFasL-BMC) or the combination of SA-FasL and SA-IL-2 (mFasL/IL-2-BMC) one day later. <figref idref="f0009 f0010"><b>FIG. 11 A-C</b></figref><b>.</b> Selected groups of mice were also treated i.p. with 500 ng/daily for 15 doses of soluble SA-FasL (sFasL), 25,000 IU/daily for 7 doses of soluble IL-2 (sIL-2; human IL-2 obtained commercially or produced in house using insect cells transfected with human IL-2 cDNA engineered to include a 6xHis tag for purification) or combination of both molecules (sFasL+sIL-2). The indicated groups also were treated i.p. with 10 daily doses of rapamycin at 0.5 mg/kg. Percent donor chimerism at various times post-transplantation was assessed using peripheral blood lymphocytes with antibodies against donor class I MHC molecule in flow cytometry. <figref idref="f0009"><b>FIG. 11A</b></figref><b>,</b> average donor chimerism, <figref idref="f0009"><b>FIG. 11B</b></figref><b>,</b> percent engraftment, <figref idref="f0010"><b>FIG. 11C</b></figref><b>,</b> Long-term chimeric mice reject C3H third-party, but not BALB/c donor skin, demonstrating donor-specific tolerance.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">These data demonstrated that the generation of durable mixed allogeneic chimerism in mice pretreated with 300 cGy total body irradiation required both SA-FasL/IL-2 attached to the surface of BM cells as well as systemic treatment of recipients either with soluble SA-FasL or IL-2. However, the systemic use of both molecules as biologics improved the efficacy of percent donor chimerism as well as engraftment because all the recipients were successfully engrafted. Importantly, long-term chimeric mice were immunocompetent and tolerant to donor antigens as<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> they rejected third party, but not donor, skin grafts. Therefore, the combined use of SA-FasL and IL-2 improves long-term transplant tolerance.</p>
